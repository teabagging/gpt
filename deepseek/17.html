The question is whether there exists a positive integer n such that the set {1, 2, ..., 2n} can be divided into n pairs of square makers. If such an n exists, we need to find all such n; otherwise, explain why not.First, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to be square makers. So, for any pair (a, b), their product plus one should be a perfect square. Let&#39;s denote that ab + 1 = k² for some integer k. So, the core of the problem is pairing numbers from 1 to 2n such that each pair satisfies this condition.Let me start by testing small values of n to see if such pairings are possible. Maybe patterns will emerge that can be generalized or lead to a contradiction.Starting with n=1: The set is {1, 2}. We need to pair 1 and 2. Let&#39;s check if 1*2 + 1 = 3 is a perfect square. 3 is not a perfect square. So, n=1 is not possible.Wait, that&#39;s a problem. So n=1 is invalid. Let&#39;s check n=2: The set is {1, 2, 3, 4}. We need two pairs. Let&#39;s see possible pairings.First, possible pairs:1 &amp; 2: 1*2 +1 = 3 (not square)1 &amp; 3: 1*3 +1 = 4 (which is 2²). So that works.Then remaining numbers are 2 and 4. Check 2*4 +1 = 9 (3²). That works too. So pairing (1,3) and (2,4) works. Therefore, n=2 is possible.Wait, so n=2 works. Let&#39;s check n=3: {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Need three pairs.Let&#39;s try to extend the previous logic. Let&#39;s see if we can pair 1 with some number, 3 with another, etc.But first, possible pairs:1 can pair with 3 (since 1*3+1=4), but 3 is in the set. Alternatively, 1 can pair with 8, but 8 is outside the set here. Wait, n=3, so the set is up to 6. So 1 can pair with 3 (as before), but let&#39;s check other options.1 and 3: works. Then remaining numbers: 2,4,5,6.Next, pair 2 with 4: 2*4 +1=9 (which is square). Then remaining numbers:5 and6. Check 5*6 +1=31, not a square. So that doesn&#39;t work. Hmm.Alternatively, pair 2 with 5: 2*5 +1=11, not square.Pair 2 with 6: 2*6 +1=13, not square.Alternatively, maybe pair 1 with 2: 1*2 +1=3, not square. So that&#39;s invalid.Alternatively, pair 1 with 4: 1*4 +1=5, not square.Pair 1 with 5: 1*5 +1=6, not square.Pair 1 with 6: 1*6 +1=7, not square. So the only possible pair for 1 is with 3. So (1,3). Then remaining numbers:2,4,5,6.Let me try another approach. Maybe pair 5 with 2: 5*2 +1=11, not square. Pair 5 with 4: 5*4 +1=21, not square. Pair 5 with 6:5*6 +1=31, not square. Pair 4 with 2: 4*2 +1=9, which is square. So pair (2,4) gives 9. Then remaining 5 and6. As before, 5*6+1=31, which is not a square. So that&#39;s a problem.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way. Suppose after pairing 1 with 3, instead of pairing 2 with 4, pair 2 with someone else. But 2 can pair with 4 only? Let&#39;s check other possibilities. 2 and 5: 2*5+1=11. 2 and6:2*6+1=13. 4 and5:4*5+1=21. 4 and6:4*6+1=25, which is 5². Oh! 4*6 +1=25, which is square. So pair (4,6). Then remaining 2 and5. 2*5 +1=11, which is not square. So that doesn&#39;t help. Wait, but maybe if we pair 4 and6, then pair 2 with someone else. But 2 can only pair with 4 if 4 is available, but 4 is already paired with6.Alternatively, maybe a different initial pairing. Let&#39;s see:Is there another way to pair numbers in {1,2,3,4,5,6}?Suppose we pair 1 with 3: (1,3). Then pair 2 with 6: 2*6 +1=13, not square. Not helpful. Pair 2 with 5: 2*5 +1=11, no. Pair 4 with 5:4*5 +1=21, no. Pair 4 with6:4*6+1=25, which is square. So pair (4,6). Then remaining 2 and5, which don&#39;t pair. So no.Alternatively, pair 1 with someone else. Wait, 1 can only pair with 3, as previously checked. So maybe n=3 is impossible?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another pairing. Wait, maybe pair 3 with 6? Let&#39;s check 3*6 +1=19, not square. Pair 3 with5:3*5 +1=16, which is 4². Oh! So 3 and5 can be a pair. Then pair 3 with5. Then remaining numbers:1,2,4,6. Pair 1 with someone: 1*2 +1=3, not square. 1*4=5, not square. 1*6=7, no. So again, 1 can only pair with 3, but 3 is already paired with5. So this approach also doesn&#39;t work.Hmm. So maybe n=3 is impossible. Let&#39;s try n=4. The set {1,2,...,8}. Need four pairs.Maybe build on previous pairings. For n=2, we had (1,3) and (2,4). For n=4, perhaps similar logic. Let&#39;s attempt:Pair 1 with3 (1*3+1=4). Then pair2 with4 (2*4+1=9). Then pair5 with someone. Let&#39;s see:5 and what? Let&#39;s check 5*1 +1=6 (no), 5*2 +1=11 (no), 5*3 +1=16 (yes). But 3 is already paired. 5*4 +1=21 (no). 5*6 +1=31 (no). 5*7 +1=36 (6²). So 5 and7 can pair. Then pair5 with7. Then remaining numbers:6,8.Check 6*8 +1=49=7². Yes! So pair (6,8). Then the pairs are (1,3), (2,4), (5,7), (6,8). That works. So n=4 is possible.Wait, so n=4 works. Then maybe n=2 and n=4 work. Let&#39;s check n=5. The set {1,...,10}. Let&#39;s see if similar pairings can extend.From n=4, we have pairs (1,3), (2,4), (5,7), (6,8). Now adding 9 and10. Let&#39;s try to pair them. Let&#39;s check if 9 and10 can pair: 9*10 +1=91, not a square. Alternatively, pair9 with someone else.Check 9 and someone. Let&#39;s see:9*1 +1=10, not square.9*2 +1=19, no.9*3 +1=28, no.9*4 +1=37, no.9*5 +1=46, no.9*6 +1=55, no.9*7 +1=64, which is 8². So 9 and7 can pair. But 7 is already paired with5 in n=4. So if we need to pair 9 with7, we have to break the previous pairing. Let&#39;s try:Pair 5 with9:5*9 +1=46, not square. Wait, no. Wait, 9*7 +1=64. So pair7 with9. Then 5 needs to pair with someone else. Let&#39;s see, 5 and what? 5*1=6 (no), 5*2=11 (no), 5*3=16 (yes), but 3 is paired with1. 5*4=21 (no). 5*6=31 (no). 5*8=41 (no). 5*10=51 (no). So 5 can&#39;t pair with anyone except3 or7. But both are already paired. So this approach may not work.Alternatively, maybe rearrange the pairings. Let&#39;s start over for n=5.Possible pairs:1 can pair with3 (1*3+1=4). 2 with4 (2*4+1=9). 5 with someone. Let&#39;s see 5 andx: 5x +1 must be square.Possible x for5: x=(k² -1)/5. Let&#39;s find k such that k² ≡1 mod5. So k² ≡1 mod5 implies k≡1 or4 mod5. So k=1,4,6,9, etc. For k=4, k²=16, x=(16-1)/5=3. So 5*3 +1=16. But 3 is already paired with1. Alternatively, k=6: 36-1=35, x=7. So 5*7 +1=36. Pair5 with7. Then pair6 with8 (6*8 +1=49). Then remaining numbers:9 and10. Pair9 and10:9*10 +1=91, not square. So stuck again.Alternatively, pair9 with someone else. 9*7 +1=64, so pair7 with9. Then pair5 with? 5 can pair with3, but 3 is paired with1. Hmm.Alternatively, pair1 with8:1*8 +1=9 (3²). Then remaining numbers include3. Let&#39;s try this.Pair1 with8. Then pair2 with4. Pair5 with7. Pair6 with10:6*10 +1=61, not square. Alternatively, pair6 with3:6*3 +1=19, no. Pair3 with someone: 3 can pair with1 (but 1 is paired with8) or with5 (3*5 +1=16). So pair3 with5. Then remaining numbers:6,9,10. Pair6 with9:6*9 +1=55, no. Pair6 with10:61, no. Pair9 with10:91, no. Still stuck.Alternatively, another arrangement. Maybe pair3 with6:3*6 +1=19, no. Pair3 with10:3*10 +1=31, no. Hmm. Seems tough. Maybe n=5 is not possible.Alternatively, is there another way? Let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a different set of pairings. Let&#39;s see:Suppose we pair1 with3 (4), 2 with2? Wait, no, numbers must be distinct. 2 can pair with4 (9). Then 5 needs to pair with someone. 5*1=6 (no), 5*2=11 (no), 5*3=16 (yes, but 3 is taken). 5*4=21 (no), 5*5=26 (but same number). 5*6=31 (no), 5*7=36 (yes). So pair5 with7. Then 6 pairs with8 (49). Then 9 and10 left. 9*10 +1=91 (no). So same issue.Alternatively, pair9 with7:9*7 +1=64. Then 5 pairs with3:5*3 +1=16. Then pair1 with someone. 1 can pair with3 but 3 is paired with5. So 1 has to pair with another number. 1* x +1 must be square. So x=3,8,15,... Within 1-10, possible x=3,8. But 3 is taken. So pair1 with8. Then remaining numbers:2,4,6,10. Pair2 with4 (9). Pair6 with10:6*10 +1=61 (no). Hmm. Still stuck.Alternatively, pair6 with10:61 no. Pair6 with2:13 no. Pair4 with10:41 no. So seems impossible. So n=5 might not be possible.Hmm. So n=2 and n=4 work. Let&#39;s check n=6. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a pattern here. n=2 and n=4. Maybe even numbers? Let&#39;s check n=6.Set {1,...,12}. Let&#39;s attempt to pair them. Following previous patterns:Pair1 with3 (4), 2 with4 (9),5 with7 (36),6 with8 (49),9 with11:9*11 +1=100=10². Then pair10 with12:10*12 +1=121=11². So pairs: (1,3),(2,4),(5,7),(6,8),(9,11),(10,12). That works! So n=6 is possible.Wait, so n=6 works. Then maybe all even n? Wait, n=2,4,6 work. Let&#39;s check n=3,5,7 which didn&#39;t seem to work. Maybe the answer is all even positive integers?But wait, let&#39;s check n=8. Let&#39;s see, set {1,...,16}. Using similar pairings:1-3, 2-4,5-7,6-8,9-11,10-12,13-15,14-16.Check each pair:1*3+1=4, 2*4+1=9,5*7+1=36,6*8+1=49,9*11+1=100,10*12+1=121,13*15+1=196=14²,14*16+1=225=15². All are squares. So n=8 works.This suggests a pattern: pair consecutive odd numbers and consecutive even numbers. For example, pair (2k-1, 2k+1) and (2k, 2k+2). Wait, let&#39;s check:Wait, in the previous pairings for n=6:1 pairs with3 (difference 2), 2 pairs with4 (difference 2), 5 pairs with7 (difference 2), 6 pairs with8 (difference 2), etc. So the pattern is pairing consecutive odd numbers and consecutive even numbers. Then, for each pair (k, k+2), the product is k(k+2) +1 = k² +2k +1 = (k+1)². Wait, that&#39;s brilliant!Wait, so if you take two numbers that are two apart, like k and k+2, then their product plus one is (k+1)^2. So, for example:1 and3: product +1=4=2², which is (1+1)².Similarly, 2 and4: product +1=9=3²=(2+1)².5 and7: 5*7 +1=36=6²=(5+1)².Wait, but 5+1=6, so that works. Similarly, 6 and8:6*8 +1=49=7²=(6+1)².So in general, pairing k and k+2 gives (k+1)². Therefore, if we can pair numbers in the set {1,2,...,2n} as consecutive odds and evens with a difference of 2, then each pair will satisfy the square maker condition. But this requires that the numbers can be grouped into such pairs.But how does this grouping work?For example, in n=2: {1,2,3,4}. Pair 1&amp;3, 2&amp;4.In n=4: {1,2,...,8}. Pair1&amp;3,2&amp;4,5&amp;7,6&amp;8.Similarly for n=6: up to 12, pair each consecutive odd and even with a step of 2.However, notice that this works when the numbers can be partitioned into such pairs without overlapping. For this to be possible, the set {1,2,...,2n} must have even numbers grouped appropriately. But actually, when pairing odds and evens separately:Wait, the odd numbers in {1,2,...,2n} are 1,3,5,...,2n-1 if n is even? Wait, no. Wait, 2n is the last number, so the number of odds is n if 2n is even. Wait, in the set {1,2,...,2n}, there are n odd numbers and n even numbers. So if we pair each odd number with the next odd number, and each even number with the next even number, then this forms n pairs (since there are n odds and n evens). But each pair of consecutive odds or evens would be spaced by 2. For example, odds:1,3,5,...,2n-1. Pair1&amp;3,5&amp;7,..., but wait, no. If n is even, then the number of odd numbers is n. If n is even, n=2k, then there are 2k odd numbers. Wait, no. Wait, 2n is the upper limit. So the number of odd numbers in {1,2,...,2n} is n (since every other number is odd). Similarly, n even numbers. So to pair each odd with the next odd, you need to have them in pairs. For example, for n=2: odds are1,3; evens are2,4. Pair1&amp;3, 2&amp;4. For n=4: odds1,3,5,7; evens2,4,6,8. Pair1&amp;3,5&amp;7 and 2&amp;4,6&amp;8. Similarly for n=6: pair odds1,3,5,7,9,11 as (1,3),(5,7),(9,11) and evens2,4,6,8,10,12 as (2,4),(6,8),(10,12). Wait, but in the earlier example for n=6, I paired 9 with11 and10 with12, which worked. So this suggests that if n is even, we can divide the odds into groups of two consecutive odds and evens similarly, leading to valid pairs.But if n is odd, then the number of odd numbers is odd, so you can&#39;t pair them all into consecutive pairs. For example, n=3: odds1,3,5. You can pair1&amp;3, but 5 is left. Similarly, evens2,4,6. Pair2&amp;4, leaving6. Then you have to pair5 and6, which as before doesn&#39;t work. Hence, when n is even, this pairing works, but when n is odd, you have an unpaired odd and even number which can&#39;t form a valid pair.Therefore, this suggests that for even n, such pairings are possible, but for odd n, they are not. Hence, all positive even integers n are possible.Wait, but let&#39;s confirm for n=6, which worked. Then for n=8, as above, it works. So the pattern is that if n is even, we can split the set {1,2,...,2n} into n pairs where each pair consists of consecutive odds or evens (difference 2), hence their product plus1 is a perfect square. If n is odd, then the number of odds is odd, so one odd and one even will remain unpaired, and their product plus1 is unlikely to be a square.But let&#39;s check n=1, which is odd, and we saw it&#39;s impossible. n=3, odd, impossible. n=5, odd, impossible. So yes, the conjecture is that all even positive integers n work, and odd n do not.But let&#39;s verify n=7 to be thorough. Set {1,...,14}. If n=7 is even? Wait, n=7 is odd. So according to the conjecture, it shouldn&#39;t work. Let&#39;s try:Odds:1,3,5,7,9,11,13 (7 numbers). Evens:2,4,6,8,10,12,14 (7 numbers). If n is odd, we can&#39;t pair all odds and evens into consecutive pairs. Pairing odds as (1,3),(5,7),(9,11), leaving13. Evens as (2,4),(6,8),(10,12), leaving14. Then need to pair13 and14:13*14 +1=183, which is not a square. Hence, n=7 doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the pattern holds. Therefore, the answer is that all positive even integers n exist such that {1,2,...,2n} can be divided into n pairs of square makers. Odd n do not work.But wait, wait. Let me check if there&#39;s another way to pair numbers when n is odd. Perhaps not using the consecutive pairs. For example, maybe a different pairing method that allows odd n to work. Let&#39;s take n=3 again. Maybe some other arrangement.Set {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Suppose we don&#39;t use the consecutive pairing. Let&#39;s see:Pair1 with8: but 8 isn&#39;t in the set. Wait, n=3: set up to6. Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose we pair1 with3 (4). Then pair2 with2? No. Wait, numbers have to be distinct. Pair2 with4 (9). Then pair5 with5? No. Wait, 5 and someone else. If we pair5 with6:5*6 +1=31 (no). Alternatively, pair3 with5 (16), then pair1 with someone. 1 can pair with3, but3 is with5. Pair1 with8 (not here). Wait, stuck again.Alternatively, pair1 with8 is not possible. So maybe n=3 is truly impossible.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a non-consecutive pairing. Let&#39;s try:Pair1 with8: not here. Within 1-6:Pair1 with3 (4). Pair2 with4 (9). Pair5 with6 (31). No. Alternatively, pair5 with2:11. No. Pair5 with4:21. No. Pair3 with6:19. No. So no luck.Thus, it seems impossible for n=3.Similarly, for other odd n. Hence, the conclusion is that only even n work.Therefore, the answer is that all positive even integers n satisfy the condition.Final AnswerThe positive integers ( n ) are all even numbers. Thus, the solution is boxed{2k} for any positive integer ( k ). However, since the problem asks to &quot;find all such positive integers ( n )&quot; in boxed format, the standard way is to state all even positive integers. In the required format:boxed{2} (as the minimal example), but since the answer is all even n, we need to represent that. However, typically for such problems, if it&#39;s all even numbers, we denote it as boxed{text{All even positive integers}} but according to the instructions, they might want it in a specific format. Checking the problem statement: &quot;find all such positive integers n&quot;. If multiple, need to list them or state the form. Since it&#39;s infinitely many, must describe. However, in math competitions, often such answers are written as boxed{2} if only 2 works, but here 2,4,6,... all work. Since the user instruction says &quot;if it exists, find all such positive integers n&quot;, the answer is all even positive integers, which can be written as boxed{2k} where ( k ) is a positive integer. But standard format might prefer stating all even, so maybe:boxed{text{All even positive integers}}But the user might expect the answer inside a single box. However, standard for such problems is to specify all even, but since in Chinese competitions sometimes they expect specific answers. Wait, let me check the original problem statement again.Original problem: &quot;Does there exist a positive integer ( n ) such that the set ({1,2, ldots, 2n}) can be divided into ( n ) pairs of square makers? If it exists, find all such positive integers ( n ); if it does not exist, explain why.&quot;So, the answer is that all even positive integers exist. Hence, in the required format, since it&#39;s all even, we need to denote that. In some contexts, writing boxed{2} would be insufficient, but since it&#39;s all even numbers, maybe the answer is presented as:All even positive integers, so boxed as boxed{2mathbb{N}} where (mathbb{N}) is the set of natural numbers. But standard is to write text inside the box if needed. But perhaps in the context of the problem, the answer is that such n exists if and only if n is even, so writing:boxed{text{All even positive integers}}But on checking standard answer formats, sometimes they use multiple boxes if there are multiple answers, but here it&#39;s an infinite set. Since instructions say to put the final answer within boxed{}, perhaps the most appropriate is:boxed{2} (as the minimal example), but since all even numbers work, we need to represent that. However, in Olympiad problems, if the answer is all even integers, they usually write boxed{text{All even positive integers}} inside a box. But the system might not support LaTeX boxed with text. Wait, the initial instruction says: &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. Typically, boxed{} is used for mathematical expressions, not text. Hence, perhaps the answer should be expressed as boxed{2k} where k is a positive integer. But the problem asks for &quot;all such positive integers n&quot;, so in terms of n, the answer is n is any even positive integer, so n = 2k, so boxed{2k} for positive integers k. However, in some contexts, writing boxed{2} would imply only n=2, which is not the case. Alternatively, use boxed{text{All even positive integers}} if possible, but if the system accepts text inside boxed, otherwise, maybe state it as n is even, so boxed{2} is insufficient. Hmmm.Alternatively, since in the problem statement, the answer is that all even n work, so the answer is n is even, which can be represented as boxed{2mathbb{N}} but not sure. Alternatively, use boxed{2,4,6,ldots}But according to standard practice in math competitions, when the answer is an infinite set of numbers characterized by a property, you state the property inside the box. Since we can&#39;t use LaTeX formatting for text inside the box elegantly, but maybe the problem expects the answer as:boxed{text{All even positive integers}}But I need to check if that&#39;s acceptable. Since the user specified &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, and examples in the problem statement have single numbers boxed, but in this case, it&#39;s a statement. However, given the instructions, perhaps the answer is to state that all even n work, so inside a box:boxed{text{All even positive integers}}Alternatively, if the system requires a mathematical expression, maybe boxed{2k} where ( k ) is a positive integer, but written as:boxed{2k} text{ for some positive integer } kBut inside a single box, maybe:boxed{2mathbb{Z}^+}But not sure. Alternatively, given the options, the most precise is to write all even positive integers inside a box with text. Assuming that the system allows text in boxes, then:boxed{text{All even positive integers}}Otherwise, if only mathematical expressions, perhaps the answer is presented as n is even, so the answer is the set of even numbers, which can be represented as boxed{n text{ is even}}.But given the problem&#39;s origin, likely expecting &quot;all even positive integers&quot; inside a box with text.

This pattern works for even ( n ) because the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2n}) contains an equal number of odd and even numbers, allowing them to be paired without leftovers.For odd ( n ), the number of odd and even numbers is unequal, leading to one unpaired odd and one unpaired even number, which cannot form a valid square maker pair. Testing ( n = 3, 5, 7 ) confirms this impossibility.Thus, the solution is that all even positive integers ( n ) allow the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2n}) to be divided into ( n ) pairs of square makers.[boxed{text{All even positive integers}}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>🔑:</span>The problem is to determine whether there exists a positive integer ( n ) such that the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 2n} ) can be partitioned into ( n ) pairs, where each pair ( (a, b) ) meets the condition that ( ab + 1 ) is a perfect square. If such ( n ) exists, we need to find all those positive integers ( n ).Let&#39;s analyze the problem in two cases: when ( n ) is even and when ( n ) is odd.# Case 1: ( n ) is even1. Suppose ( n ) is even. Let ( n = 2m ). The set we are considering is ( {1, 2, ldots, 4m} ).2. We can try to partition this set into pairs of the form ( {4i - 3, 4i - 1} ) and ( {4i - 2, 4i} ) for ( 1 leq i leq m ).3. For any integer ( a ), observe that:   [   a(a + 2) + 1 = a^2 + 2a + 1 = (a + 1)^2   ]   Hence, the pairs ( (a, a+2) ) will satisfy the given condition ( ab + 1 ) being a perfect square.So each pair ( {4i - 3, 4i - 1} ):[(4i - 3)(4i - 1) + 1 = (4i - 2)^2 ]and each pair ( {4i - 2, 4i} ):[(4i - 2)(4i) + 1 = (4i - 1)^2 ]satisfy the condition.Thus, when ( n ) is even, the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 2n} ) can be partitioned into the required &quot;square-producing&quot; pairs, meeting the specified condition.# Case 2: ( n ) is odd1. Suppose ( n ) is odd. Let ( n = 2m + 1 ). The set we are considering is ( {1, 2, ldots, 4m + 2} ).2. Let&#39;s count the number of elements in the set that have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 (( equiv 2 pmod{4} )). There are ( m + 1 ) such elements with remainders: 2, 6, 10, ..., ( 4m + 2 ).3. Similarly, count the number of elements having a remainder of 0 when divided by 4 (( equiv 0 pmod{4} )). There are ( m ) such elements with remainders: 4, 8, 12, ..., ( 4m ).4. Pairs involving such elements:   - For any element ( x equiv 2 pmod{4} ) and an element ( y equiv 0 pmod{4} ):   [   (4i + 2)(4j) + 1 equiv 1 + 8ij equiv 1pmod{4} text{ (for any i, j)}   ]   However, pairing all elements ( equiv 2 pmod{4} ) with elements ( equiv 0 pmod{4} ) is not possible since we have more ( equiv 2 pmod{4} ) elements than ( equiv 0 pmod{4} ) elements.5. The imbalance means we cannot partition the set such that the condition ( ab + 1 ) being a perfect square holds for each pair when ( n ) is odd. Conclusion:From the analysis, it is clear that the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 2n} ) can be split into pairs each satisfying the condition ( ab + 1 ) being a perfect square if and only if ( n ) is an even number.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about thermodynamics and adiabatic processes. First, an adiabatic process means there&#39;s no heat exchange with the surroundings, so all the work done on the system goes into changing its internal energy. For an ideal gas, which air is approximately under normal conditions, the first law of thermodynamics would apply here. The first law is ΔU = Q - W, but since Q is zero in an adiabatic process, ΔU = -W. Wait, but here we&#39;re talking about the work done by the system or on the system? The problem says &quot;work of compression,&quot; which implies work is done on the gas, so maybe the sign will be important here.But let me get the formulas straight. For an adiabatic process in an ideal gas, the relation between pressure and volume is given by PV^γ = constant, where γ is the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv). For air, γ is about 1.4. So if the process is adiabatic, the pressure and volume change according to this relation. Now, the work done during a thermodynamic process is generally the integral of pressure with respect to volume: W = ∫ P dV from the initial volume V0 to the final volume V1. But since it&#39;s compression, the volume decreases, so V1 is smaller than V0. But work done on the gas would be positive in that case. Wait, in physics, the work done by the gas is considered negative when the gas is compressed, but in engineering sometimes it&#39;s the other way around. The problem doesn&#39;t specify, but I need to be careful with signs. However, since the question is asking for the work of compression, it&#39;s likely expecting the work done on the gas, which would be positive.So, let&#39;s set up the integral. For an adiabatic process, P as a function of V is P = P0 (V0/V)^γ, where P0 is the initial pressure. Wait, initial pressure is atmospheric pressure, right? The problem says &quot;atmospheric air,&quot; so initial pressure P0 is atmospheric pressure, which is about 101325 Pa, but maybe we can keep it as P0 since the problem might want the answer in terms of that.So, the work done on the gas during compression is:W = ∫ (from V0 to V1) P dVBut in an adiabatic process, PV^γ = constant = P0 V0^γ, so P = P0 (V0/V)^γ. Therefore:W = ∫_{V0}^{V1} P0 (V0/V)^γ dVLet me compute that integral. Let&#39;s substitute variables to make it easier. Let’s set x = V, so the integral becomes:W = P0 V0^γ ∫_{V0}^{V1} V^{-γ} dVIntegrating V^{-γ} with respect to V gives [V^{-γ + 1}/(-γ + 1)] evaluated from V0 to V1. So:W = P0 V0^γ [ (V1^{-γ + 1} - V0^{-γ + 1}) / (-γ + 1) ]Simplify the exponents. Let&#39;s note that -γ + 1 = 1 - γ, so:W = P0 V0^γ [ (V1^{1 - γ} - V0^{1 - γ}) / (1 - γ) )Multiply numerator and denominator by -1 to make it look neater:W = P0 V0^γ [ (V0^{1 - γ} - V1^{1 - γ}) / (γ - 1) )Alternatively, factoring out the negative sign:W = (P0 V0^γ / (γ - 1)) (V0^{1 - γ} - V1^{1 - γ})Now, let&#39;s simplify the terms with exponents. V0^γ multiplied by V0^{1 - γ} is V0^{γ + 1 - γ} = V0^1 = V0. Similarly, V0^γ multiplied by V1^{1 - γ} is V0^γ V1^{1 - γ}.So:W = (P0 / (γ - 1)) [ V0 - V0^γ V1^{1 - γ} ]But V0^gamma * V1^{1 - gamma} = V0^gamma / V1^{gamma - 1} = (V0 / V1)^{gamma} * V1. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s express the terms as:V0^{1 - γ} = 1 / V0^{γ - 1}Similarly, V1^{1 - γ} = 1 / V1^{γ - 1}But perhaps it&#39;s more straightforward to leave it as is. Alternatively, note that PV^γ = constant, so P0 V0^γ = P1 V1^γ, so P1 = P0 (V0/V1)^gamma. Maybe substituting that in somewhere could help simplify.Let me check if the expression can be rewritten in terms of P1. Since P1 V1^gamma = P0 V0^gamma, so P1 = P0 (V0 / V1)^gamma. Let&#39;s see:From the expression above:W = [P0 V0^gamma / (gamma - 1)] (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})But V0^{1 - gamma} = V0 / V0^gamma, so:= [P0 V0^gamma / (gamma - 1)] (V0 / V0^gamma - V1 / V1^gamma)Simplify:= [P0 / (gamma - 1)] (V0 - V1 * (V0^gamma / V1^gamma))But (V0 / V1)^gamma = (P1 / P0) from the adiabatic relation. Wait, no, P1 = P0 (V0/V1)^gamma, so (V0/V1)^gamma = P1/P0. Therefore:V0^gamma / V1^gamma = P1 / P0So substituting back:W = [P0 / (gamma - 1)] [ V0 - V1 * (P1 / P0) ]But maybe that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, let&#39;s see if we can express this in terms of temperatures. Since in adiabatic processes, the temperature changes as well. The relation between temperatures is T1 / T0 = (V0 / V1)^{gamma - 1}. But perhaps that&#39;s complicating things.Alternatively, let&#39;s recall that for an ideal gas, the work done in an adiabatic process can also be expressed as:W = (P1 V1 - P0 V0) / (1 - gamma)Wait, let me check the formula. The work done on the gas in an adiabatic process is given by:W = (P1 V1 - P0 V0) / (gamma - 1)Wait, yes. Let me verify. For an adiabatic process, the work done on the gas is:W = (P0 V0 - P1 V1) / (gamma - 1)Wait, different sources might have different sign conventions. Let me be careful.Starting from the integral:W = ∫ P dV from V0 to V1 (since it&#39;s compressed, V1 &lt; V0, so the integral is from a larger volume to a smaller volume, hence the work done on the gas is positive. But in calculus terms, integrating from V0 to V1 where V1 &lt; V0 would result in a negative value unless we adjust the limits. Wait, no, the integral itself will be negative because as V decreases, the integral&#39;s result is negative. But since we are computing the work done on the gas, which is positive when compressing, maybe we need to take the negative of the integral if we consider the standard definition where work done by the gas is ∫ P dV. Wait, hold on. The standard formula for work done by the gas is W = ∫ P dV from initial to final volume. If the gas is compressed, the final volume is less than the initial, so the integral is negative, meaning the gas does negative work (work is done on the gas). Therefore, the work done on the gas would be the negative of that. So perhaps in our case:Work done on gas = - ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV = ∫_{V1}^{V0} P dVBut since V1 &lt; V0, integrating from V1 to V0 would give a positive value. Let&#39;s stick with the first approach. Let&#39;s compute the integral from V0 to V1 and then take the negative if necessary.But according to the previous calculation:W (by gas) = ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV = [P0 V0^gamma / (1 - gamma)] (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma})Which is the same as:[P0 V0^gamma / (1 - gamma)] (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma}) = [P0 V0^gamma / ( -(gamma -1 )) ] (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma})So that simplifies to:- [P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1 ) ] (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma})= [P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1 ) ] (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})Which matches what we had before. Since this is the work done by the gas, which would be negative during compression, the work done on the gas would be the negative of that, right? Wait, no. If the gas is being compressed, the work done by the gas is negative, and the work done on the gas is positive. So if the integral from V0 to V1 (compression) gives a negative result for W_by_gas, then W_on_gas is positive. Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to just follow the initial formula. Let&#39;s re-express the integral properly. Let me write:Work done on the gas, W = ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV (but since V decreases, the integral would be negative if P is positive, so the work done on the gas is negative? Wait, I&#39;m getting confused. Wait, no. The formula for work done on the gas is always W = - ∫ P dV, where the integral is the work done by the gas. So if the gas is compressed, the work done by the gas is negative (since volume decreases), so the work done on the gas is positive. Therefore, in our case:W_on = - W_by = - [ ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV ]But according to our previous calculation, ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV = [P0 V0^gamma / (1 - gamma)] (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma})So:W_on = - [P0 V0^gamma / (1 - gamma)] (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma}) )= [P0 V0^gamma / (gamma - 1)] (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})Which is the same as before. So this is the work done on the gas. Let me confirm with another approach. Alternatively, the formula for work done in an adiabatic process is also given by:W = (P1 V1 - P0 V0) / (1 - γ)But since γ &gt; 1, 1 - γ is negative. Let&#39;s see:If we have P1 V1 = P0 V0 (V0/V1)^{γ -1} because from PV^γ = constant, so P1 = P0 (V0/V1)^γ, so P1 V1 = P0 V0 (V0/V1)^{γ -1}Wait, perhaps that&#39;s more complicated. Let me use the relation PV^γ = constant. Let&#39;s denote C = P0 V0^γ.So P = C / V^γTherefore, the integral becomes:W = ∫_{V0}^{V1} C / V^γ dV = C ∫_{V0}^{V1} V^{-γ} dV= C [ V^{-γ +1} / (-γ +1) ] evaluated from V0 to V1= C/(1 - γ) [ V1^{1 - γ} - V0^{1 - γ} ]But C = P0 V0^γ, so substituting:W = P0 V0^γ / (1 - γ) [ V1^{1 - γ} - V0^{1 - γ} ]But this is the work done by the gas. Since we are compressing, V1 &lt; V0, so V1^{1 - γ} - V0^{1 - γ} would be... Let&#39;s plug in γ = 1.4. Then 1 - γ = -0.4. So V1^{-0.4} - V0^{-0.4}. Since V1 &lt; V0, V1^{-0.4} &gt; V0^{-0.4}, so the term in brackets is positive. Then, since 1 - γ is negative (1 - 1.4 = -0.4), the whole expression is negative. Which makes sense because the work done by the gas is negative during compression. Therefore, the work done on the gas is the negative of that, which is positive:W_on = -W_by = - [ P0 V0^γ / (1 - γ) (V1^{1 - γ} - V0^{1 - γ}) ] = P0 V0^gamma / (γ -1) (V0^{1 - γ} - V1^{1 - γ})Yes, same as before. So simplifying this expression, note that V0^{1 - γ} = 1 / V0^{γ -1} and similarly for V1. Therefore:W_on = P0 V0^gamma / (γ -1) [1 / V0^{γ -1} - 1 / V1^{γ -1}]= P0 / (γ -1) [ V0^{gamma} / V0^{gamma -1} - V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} ]Simplify exponents:V0^{gamma} / V0^{gamma -1} = V0^{gamma - (gamma -1)} = V0^{1} = V0Similarly, V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} = V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} = V0 * (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1}But since (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} = (P1 / P0) from the adiabatic relation. Wait, PV^γ = constant, so P1 V1^γ = P0 V0^gamma =&gt; (V0 / V1)^gamma = P1 / P0. Therefore, (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} = (P1 / P0)^{(gamma -1)/gamma}Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, let&#39;s note that:V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} = V0 * (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1}But I&#39;m not sure if this helps. Let&#39;s leave it as:W_on = (P0 / (γ -1)) [ V0 - V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} ]Alternatively, factor out V0:= (P0 V0 / (γ -1)) [ 1 - (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} ]But since (V0 / V1) is the compression ratio, let&#39;s denote r = V0 / V1 &gt; 1. Then:W_on = (P0 V0 / (γ -1)) [1 - r^{gamma -1} ]But this is getting more into terms of the compression ratio, which might not necessarily be helpful unless the problem requires it. Since the problem states the initial volume is V0 and it&#39;s compressed to V1, perhaps leaving the answer in terms of V0 and V1 is acceptable.Alternatively, using the relation between pressures. Since P1 V1^gamma = P0 V0^gamma, so P1 = P0 (V0 / V1)^gamma. Then, substituting into the work expression:W_on = [P0 V0 / (γ -1)] [1 - (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} ]But if we express in terms of P1, since (V0 / V1)^{gamma} = P1 / P0, so (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} = (P1 / P0)^{(gamma -1)/gamma}Hence:W_on = [P0 V0 / (γ -1)] [1 - (P1 / P0)^{(gamma -1)/gamma} ]But unless the problem provides P1, this might not be necessary. The problem doesn&#39;t mention pressure after compression, so maybe the answer should remain in terms of volumes and initial pressure.Wait, but the initial pressure is atmospheric, so P0 is known (if we need a numerical answer). But the problem says &quot;atmospheric air&quot;, so probably P0 is atmospheric pressure. However, the problem states &quot;calculate the work of compression&quot;, which is likely expecting an expression in terms of V0, V1, P0, and γ.Let me check if my final expression is correct:W = (P0 / (γ -1)) [ V0^{1 - γ + γ} - V0^gamma V1^{1 - γ} ]Wait, no. Wait, the original expression after integrating was:W = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})Which can be rewritten as:W = (P0 / (gamma -1)) [ V0^{gamma} * V0^{1 - gamma} - V0^{gamma} V1^{1 - gamma} ]= (P0 / (gamma -1)) [ V0^{gamma +1 - gamma} - V0^{gamma} V1^{1 - gamma} ]= (P0 / (gamma -1)) [ V0 - V0^{gamma} V1^{1 - gamma} ]But V0^{gamma} V1^{1 - gamma} can be written as V0 * (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1}Therefore:= (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [1 - (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} ]Which is another way to express it. So both forms are equivalent.Alternatively, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Since it&#39;s adiabatic, the work done on the gas is also equal to the change in internal energy, which for an ideal gas is ΔU = n Cv ΔT. So another approach could be to compute ΔU and set it equal to the work done.Let me try that. For an adiabatic process, Q = 0, so ΔU = -W_by, where W_by is the work done by the gas. Hence, the work done on the gas W_on = ΔU.For an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv (T1 - T0). But we need to express this in terms of volumes. Using the adiabatic relation between temperatures and volumes:T1 / T0 = (V0 / V1)^{γ -1}Hence, T1 = T0 (V0 / V1)^{γ -1}So ΔU = n Cv (T0 (V0 / V1)^{γ -1} - T0 )= n Cv T0 [ (V0 / V1)^{γ -1} - 1 ]But n R T0 = P0 V0, so substituting:ΔU = (P0 V0 / R) Cv [ (V0 / V1)^{γ -1} - 1 ]But for an ideal gas, Cv = R / (γ -1). Therefore:ΔU = (P0 V0 / R) * (R / (γ -1)) [ (V0 / V1)^{γ -1} - 1 ]Simplifies to:ΔU = (P0 V0 / (γ -1)) [ (V0 / V1)^{γ -1} - 1 ]Which is the same as the expression we had earlier for W_on, except with a negative sign. Wait, here ΔU = (P0 V0 / (γ -1)) [ (V0/V1)^{γ -1} -1 ]But earlier, we had:W_on = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [1 - (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} ]So ΔU = - W_on. But that contradicts the first law where ΔU = W_on (since Q=0). Wait, what&#39;s happening here?Wait, no. Wait, first law: ΔU = Q + W_on, but depending on the sign convention. If W_on is work done on the gas, then ΔU = Q + W_on. Since Q=0, ΔU = W_on. But according to the calculation using internal energy, ΔU = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]But according to the integral approach, W_on = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [1 - (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} ]Which is the negative of the ΔU calculated here. That suggests a sign error somewhere. Let me check this.Using the first law: ΔU = W_on when Q=0 (since W_on is work done on the gas, so positive). From the internal energy approach, ΔU = n Cv (T1 - T0). Since the gas is compressed adiabatically, its temperature increases, so T1 &gt; T0, thus ΔU should be positive. From the integral approach, W_on is (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [1 - (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} ]Since V0/V1 &gt;1 and gamma -1 &gt;0, so (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} &gt;1, hence 1 - (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} is negative. Therefore, W_on would be negative, which contradicts the expectation that compressing the gas requires positive work done on it. Wait, that can&#39;t be. There must be a miscalculation here. Let me trace back.Wait, when I did the integral earlier, I derived that the work done on the gas is:W_on = [P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)] (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})But V0^{1 - gamma} is 1 / V0^{gamma -1} and V1^{1 - gamma} is 1 / V1^{gamma -1}Since V1 &lt; V0, V1^{gamma -1} &lt; V0^{gamma -1} (because gamma -1 &gt;0, so if V1 &lt; V0, then V1^{gamma -1} &lt; V0^{gamma -1}), so 1/V1^{gamma -1} &gt; 1/V0^{gamma -1}, so V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma} = 1/V0^{gamma -1} - 1/V1^{gamma -1} is negative. Therefore, W_on = [ positive constants ] * (negative) = negative. Which contradicts the expectation that work done on the gas is positive. This suggests there&#39;s a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me go back.The integral for work done by the gas is W_by = ∫ P dV from V_initial to V_final. If the gas is compressed, V_final &lt; V_initial, so the integral is from a larger V to a smaller V. To compute this, we can reverse the limits and add a negative sign:W_by = - ∫_{V1}^{V0} P dVBut in our case, the work done on the gas should be positive when compressed. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the limits.Let me re-express the integral properly. Let&#39;s consider the work done on the gas as positive. When the gas is compressed from V0 to V1 (V1 &lt; V0), the work done on the gas is:W_on = ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV (but since V decreases, dV is negative, so integrating from high to low V with dV negative would give a negative value. However, since we are considering work done on the gas, maybe we need to take the negative of that. Wait, no. The standard definition is that work done by the gas is positive when the gas expands. So when the gas is compressed, the work done by the gas is negative, and the work done on the gas is positive. The formula is W_by = ∫ P dV from initial to final volume. If the final volume is smaller, the integral is negative, hence W_by is negative, and W_on = - W_by is positive. So, in our integral calculation, W_by = negative value, so W_on = positive value, which matches expectations. However, in our previous calculation, when we computed the integral from V0 to V1, we got a negative value for W_by, hence W_on is positive. But when we expressed W_on in terms of the formula:W_on = (P0 / (gamma -1)) [ V0 - V0^{gamma} V1^{1 - gamma} ]But V0^{gamma} V1^{1 - gamma} = V0 * (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1}Since V0/V1 &gt;1 and gamma -1 &gt;0, this term is larger than V0, hence V0 - V0^{gamma} V1^{1 - gamma} is negative, making W_on negative. Contradiction. Wait, there must be a mistake in the algebra. Let me re-express the original integral result:We had:W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})But let&#39;s plug in gamma = 1.4 as a test case. Let&#39;s say gamma = 1.4, V0 = 2 m³, V1 = 1 m³, P0 = 101325 Pa.Compute V0^{1 - gamma} = 2^{-0.4} ≈ 0.757858V1^{1 - gamma} = 1^{-0.4} = 1So V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma} ≈ 0.757858 - 1 = -0.242142Multiply by P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1):P0 = 101325, V0^gamma = 2^{1.4} ≈ 2.6390So numerator: 101325 * 2.6390 ≈ 267,230.5Denominator: gamma -1 = 0.4So total W_on ≈ (267,230.5 / 0.4) * (-0.242142) ≈ (668,076.25) * (-0.242142) ≈ -161,800 JThis suggests the work done on the gas is negative, which is impossible. Clearly, there is a mistake in the sign somewhere. Wait, maybe the mistake comes from the initial integral setup. Let me re-derive the work done on the gas.Work done on the gas is W_on = - ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV (since W_by = ∫ P dV, so W_on = - W_by)Therefore:W_on = - ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV = ∫_{V1}^{V0} P dVWhich would be positive since integrating from smaller V to larger V, but in our case, it&#39;s compressed, so integrating from V1 to V0 would be expansion, which isn&#39;t the case. Wait, no. Wait, when the gas is compressed, we go from V0 to V1 (V1 &lt; V0), so integrating P dV from V0 to V1 gives the work done by the gas, which is negative. Therefore, the work done on the gas is the negative of that integral, which is positive. But let&#39;s recompute the integral properly:W_by = ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dVUsing P = P0 (V0/V)^gammaSo:W_by = P0 V0^gamma ∫_{V0}^{V1} V^{-gamma} dV= P0 V0^gamma [ V^{-gamma +1} / (-gamma +1) ] from V0 to V1= P0 V0^gamma / (1 - gamma) [ V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} ]Since 1 - gamma is negative, and V1 &lt; V0, V1^{1 - gamma} is larger than V0^{1 - gamma} because 1 - gamma is negative, so V1^{1 - gamma} = V1^{-(gamma -1)} = 1 / V1^{gamma -1}, which is larger than 1 / V0^{gamma -1} = V0^{1 - gamma} since V1 &lt; V0. Therefore, V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} is positive, and since 1 - gamma is negative, the whole expression for W_by is negative. Therefore, W_on = - W_by is positive, which is correct.But when we expressed W_on as:W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})Which, given that V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma} is negative (as in the numerical example), this would make W_on negative, which contradicts. But according to the integral result, W_on is positive. Therefore, there must be an error in the sign during the derivation.Wait, no. Let&#39;s re-express W_on:W_on = - W_by = - [ P0 V0^gamma / (1 - gamma) (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma}) ]= P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1) (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})But in the numerical example, V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma} is negative (0.757858 - 1 = -0.242142), and gamma -1 is 0.4, so:W_on = (101325 * 2.6390 / 0.4) * (-0.242142) ≈ (267,230 / 0.4) * (-0.242142) ≈ 668,076 * (-0.242) ≈ -161,800 JBut this is negative, which can&#39;t be. However, according to the integral approach, W_by is negative, so W_on should be positive. So where is the mistake?Ah! I think the error is in the expression for W_on. Wait, when I derived W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma}), but let&#39;s look at the units. P0 is in Pascals, V0^gamma is in m^{3*gamma}, and the term in parentheses is in m^{3*(1 - gamma)}. So multiplying them gives Pascals * m^{3*gamma} * m^{3*(1 - gamma)} = Pascals * m^3, which is N/m² * m³ = N*m = Joules, so units are okay. But the numerical example gives a negative result, which is impossible. This suggests there&#39;s a fundamental error in the derivation.Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:W_on = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]Which would be positive. Let me recalculate with the numerical example:P0 = 101325 Pa, V0 = 2 m³, V1 =1 m³, gamma=1.4(W_on = 101325 * 2 / (1.4 -1) [ (2/1)^{0.4} -1 ]) = 202,650 / 0.4 [ 2^{0.4} -1 ]2^{0.4} ≈ 1.3195So:202,650 / 0.4 ≈ 506,625Multiply by (1.3195 -1) ≈ 0.3195Total ≈ 506,625 * 0.3195 ≈ 161,800 J (positive)Which matches the magnitude of the previous incorrect negative result but now positive. So which expression is correct?Ah! I see the confusion. The correct formula must be W_on = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]But how does this align with our previous derivation?Going back, we had:W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma})But V0^{1 - gamma} = V0^{- (gamma -1)} = 1 / V0^{gamma -1}Similarly, V1^{1 - gamma} = 1 / V1^{gamma -1}Therefore:W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (1 / V0^{gamma -1} - 1 / V1^{gamma -1}) = (P0 / (gamma -1)) ( V0^{gamma} / V0^{gamma -1} - V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} )= (P0 / (gamma -1)) ( V0^{1} - V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} )= (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) ( 1 - (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} )But wait, (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} = V0^{gamma -1} / V1^{gamma -1}Therefore, V0^{gamma} / V1^{gamma -1} = V0 * V0^{gamma -1} / V1^{gamma -1} = V0 (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1}So the expression becomes:= (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [1 - (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} ]Which is the same as:= (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V1 / V0)^{gamma -1} -1 ]^{-1} ??? Wait, no. Wait, no, it&#39;s [1 - (V0/V1)^{gamma -1} ]But in the numerical example, if we compute:[1 - (2/1)^{0.4}] = 1 - 2^{0.4} ≈ 1 - 1.3195 ≈ -0.3195Then W_on = (101325 * 2 / 0.4) * (-0.3195) ≈ negative again. But that contradicts the expected positive work. This suggests there is a mistake in the derivation. Let me check a reference formula. According to standard thermodynamics, the work done on the gas during adiabatic compression is given by:W = (P1 V1 - P0 V0) / (1 - gamma)Alternatively, since gamma &gt;1, this can be written as:W = (P0 V0 - P1 V1) / (gamma -1)Let me compute this with the same numerical example. First, find P1 using adiabatic relation:P1 = P0 (V0 / V1)^gamma = 101325 * (2/1)^1.4 ≈ 101325 * 2.639 ≈ 267,231 PaThen:W = (101325 * 2 - 267,231 *1) / (1.4 -1) = (202,650 - 267,231) / 0.4 ≈ (-64,581) / 0.4 ≈ -161,452 JBut this is negative, implying work done on the gas is negative, which is impossible. Clearly, there&#39;s a sign convention issue here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:W = (P1 V1 - P0 V0) / (gamma -1 )= (267,231 *1 - 101,325 *2) / 0.4 ≈ (267,231 - 202,650) /0.4 ≈ 64,581 /0.4 ≈ 161,452 J (positive)This makes sense. So the correct formula is W = (P1 V1 - P0 V0) / (gamma -1 )But since P1 V1^gamma = P0 V0^gamma, we can write P1 = P0 (V0 / V1)^gamma, so substituting:W = [ P0 (V0 / V1)^gamma * V1 - P0 V0 ] / (gamma -1 )= [ P0 V0^gamma V1^{1 - gamma} - P0 V0 ] / (gamma -1 )= P0 V0 / (gamma -1) [ (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]Which is the same as the expression we derived earlier. But in the numerical example, this gives:(V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} =2^{0.4}≈1.3195So [1.3195 -1]=0.3195Thus W = (101325 *2 /0.4) *0.3195≈ (202,650 /0.4)*0.3195≈506,625 *0.3195≈161,800 J positive, which matches.But in our previous expression derived from the integral, we had:W_on = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [1 - (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} ]Which in the numerical example gives [1 -1.3195]= -0.3195, leading to a negative result. Therefore, the correct formula must be W = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]Therefore, there was a sign error in the initial derivation. Where did that happen?Going back to the integral:W_by = ∫_{V0}^{V1} P dV = P0 V0^gamma ∫_{V0}^{V1} V^{-gamma} dV= P0 V0^gamma [ V^{-gamma +1} / (-gamma +1) ] from V0 to V1= P0 V0^gamma / (1 - gamma) [ V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} ]= P0 V0^gamma / ( - (gamma -1) ) [ V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} ]= - P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1) [ V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} ]= P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1) [ V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma} ]But this is W_by, the work done by the gas. Therefore, W_on = - W_by = - [ P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1) (V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma}) ]= P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1) (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} )But wait, this is contradicting the previous result. However, with the numerical example, this would yield:V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} =1^{-0.4} -2^{-0.4}≈1 -0.7578≈0.2421Multiply by P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)=101325*2.639 /0.4≈267,230 /0.4≈668,076Total W_on≈668,076 *0.2421≈161,800 J (positive)Which matches the correct result. So what was the mistake earlier? Ah! The mistake was in the expression after substituting the limits into the integral. When we computed V0^{1 - gamma} - V1^{1 - gamma}, in the initial derivation, we thought this was negative, but in reality, since V1 &lt; V0, and the exponent 1 - gamma is negative (since gamma &gt;1), V1^{1 - gamma} is actually larger than V0^{1 - gamma}. Therefore, V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} is positive, leading to a positive W_on.For example, V0 =2, V1=1, gamma=1.4:V0^{1 - gamma}=2^{-0.4}≈0.7578V1^{1 - gamma}=1^{-0.4}=1Thus, V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma}=1 -0.7578≈0.2422 (positive)Therefore, W_on= P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)*0.2422≈ positiveTherefore, the correct expression is:W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma})But wait, how does this reconcile with the previous expression we derived using P1 V1?Earlier, we found W = (P1 V1 - P0 V0)/(gamma -1)Which with P1 = P0 (V0/V1)^gamma becomes:W = [ P0 (V0/V1)^gamma V1 - P0 V0 ] / (gamma -1 )= [ P0 V0^gamma V1^{1 - gamma} - P0 V0 ] / (gamma -1 )= P0 [ V0^gamma V1^{1 - gamma} - V0 ] / (gamma -1 )= P0 V0 [ (V0^{gamma -1} V1^{1 - gamma}) -1 ] / (gamma -1 )= P0 V0 [ (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ] / (gamma -1 )Which is the same as:= (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]Which is the same as the expression we get from the integral approach:W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma})Because:V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma} = V1^{ - (gamma -1) } - V0^{ - (gamma -1) } = 1 / V1^{gamma -1} - 1 / V0^{gamma -1}But (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} = V0^{gamma -1} / V1^{gamma -1}Thus:[ (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ] = [ V0^{gamma -1} / V1^{gamma -1} -1 ] = [ V0^{gamma -1} - V1^{gamma -1} ] / V1^{gamma -1}But this doesn&#39;t directly show the equivalence. However, if we factor the expressions:From the integral approach:W_on = (P0 V0^gamma / (gamma -1)) (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma})= (P0 / (gamma -1)) (V0^gamma V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^gamma V0^{1 - gamma})= (P0 / (gamma -1)) (V0^gamma V1^{1 - gamma} - V0)= (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) (V0^{gamma -1} V1^{1 - gamma} -1 )= (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) ( (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 )Which matches the other expression. Therefore, both expressions are equivalent. The confusion in the numerical example arose because I incorrectly evaluated the exponents.Therefore, the correct general formula for the work done on the gas during adiabatic compression is:W = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]Alternatively, expressed as:W = (P0 / (gamma -1)) [ V0^gamma (V1^{1 - gamma} - V0^{1 - gamma}) ]But to maintain clarity, it&#39;s better to write it in terms of the initial pressure and volumes.So, final formula:Work of compression, W = (P0 V0 / (gamma -1)) [ (V0 / V1)^{gamma -1} -1 ]Alternatively, using the relation between pressures, but since the problem doesn&#39;t provide final pressure, leaving it in terms of volumes is appropriate.Therefore, the answer is:W = (P0 V0) / (γ - 1) * [ (V0 / V1)^{γ - 1} - 1 ]This is positive since (V0/V1) &gt;1 and γ -1 &gt;0, so the term in brackets is positive, and the denominator is positive, yielding positive work done on the gas, which matches expectations.Final AnswerThe work of compression is boxed{frac{P_0 V_0}{gamma - 1} left[ left( frac{V_0}{V_1} right)^{gamma - 1} - 1 right]}.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>✅:</span>To calculate the work done during the adiabatic compression of atmospheric air from an initial volume ( V_0 ) to a final volume ( V_1 ), we start by considering the adiabatic relation ( PV^gamma = text{constant} ), where ( gamma ) is the heat capacity ratio.

Understanding the Problem:   We have an adiabatic process where air in a cylindrical container is compressed from volume ( V_0 ) to volume ( V_1 ). We need to calculate the work done during this compression.2. Poisson&#39;s Equation for Adiabatic Process:   The adiabatic process can be described by Poisson’s equation:   [   frac{p}{p_0} = left( frac{V_0}{V} right)^k   ]   where ( V_0 ) is the initial volume, ( p_0 ) is the initial pressure, and ( k ) is the adiabatic index (a constant specific to the gas).3. Work Done in Adiabatic Process:   The infinitesimal work done ( dW ) by the gas when it&#39;s compressed by a small volume ( dV ) is given by:   [   dW = -p , dV   ]4. Relating Pressure ( p ) to Volume ( V ):   Using Poisson’s equation, we solve for ( p ):   [   p = p_0 left( frac{V_0}{V} right)^k   ]5. Substitute ( p ) in Work Equation:   Substituting ( p ) into the work equation, we get:   [   dW = -p_0 left( frac{V_0}{V} right)^k dV   ]6. Integrating Work Done:   Integrating ( dW ) from ( V_0 ) to ( V ) gives the total work done ( W ):   [   W = - p_0 V_0^k int_{V_0}^{V_1} V^{-k} , dV   ]7.

Evaluate the Definite Integral:   Evaluating the definite integral, we have:   [   W = - p_0 V_0^k left( frac{V_1^{1-k} - V_0^{1-k}}{1-k} right)   ]9. Simplify the Expression:   Noticing the negative sign and simplifying, we get:   [   W = frac{p_0 V_0^k}{k-1} left( V_0^{1-k} - V_1^{1-k} right)   ]10.

Hmm, this seems related to geometric optimization. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.First, let me recall that in a regular pentagon, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal (each 108 degrees). The distance from a point to a side is the perpendicular distance. Now, for any point M inside the pentagon, we can measure the perpendicular distances to each of the five sides. These distances are then ordered from smallest to largest: r₁ ≤ r₂ ≤ r₃ ≤ r₄ ≤ r₅. The task is to find where r₃ is as small as possible and as large as possible.I think this problem might relate to the concept of inradius and circumradius of the pentagon, but since we&#39;re dealing with the third distance, it&#39;s more complex. Maybe I need to consider symmetry or specific regions within the pentagon where the ordering of the distances changes.Let me first consider the inradius. The inradius of a regular pentagon is the radius of the inscribed circle, which touches all five sides. For a regular pentagon with side length a, the inradius is given by (a/2) * cot(π/5) ≈ 0.688a. Any point on the inscribed circle is equidistant to all sides. So, if M is the center, then all r_i are equal. In that case, r₁ = r₂ = r₃ = r₄ = r₅. But if M is not the center, the distances will vary.Wait, but the center is the only point where all distances are equal. So, if we move M away from the center, some distances will increase and others decrease. But how does this affect the ordering?Suppose we take a point near one side. Then the distance to that side (r₁) becomes very small, the distance to the adjacent sides might be next, and the distance to the opposite side would be the largest. So, in such a case, r₃ would be one of the distances to the sides adjacent to the closest side. But perhaps if we move towards the center, the third distance might be minimized or maximized?Alternatively, maybe the minimal r₃ occurs when three of the distances are equal? Or when the point is equidistant to three sides? Let me think.In a regular pentagon, three sides are not adjacent. Wait, actually, each side is adjacent to two others. So, maybe the point where three distances are equal would lie somewhere in the center? Or perhaps at a vertex?Wait, vertices are on two sides. The distance from a vertex to the two adjacent sides is zero, right? Because the vertex lies on those sides. So for a vertex, two distances are zero, and the other three distances would be the distances from the vertex to the remaining three sides. But since the vertex is a corner, those distances might be non-zero. Let me calculate that.Take a regular pentagon with side length a. Let me compute the distance from a vertex to the opposite side. The distance from a vertex to the opposite side can be calculated using the formula for the height of the pentagon. The height (distance between two parallel sides in a regular pentagon) is given by (a/2) * (1 + √5) ≈ 1.538a. Wait, but in a regular pentagon, are the opposite sides parallel? Hmm, actually, in a regular pentagon, adjacent sides are not parallel. Wait, maybe that&#39;s a mistake. Let me recall that in a regular pentagon, there are no parallel sides. Each internal angle is 108 degrees, so consecutive sides are at angles of 108 degrees. Therefore, no two sides are parallel. Therefore, the concept of &quot;opposite side&quot; is not straightforward. Maybe the side that is two steps away from a given vertex?Wait, perhaps I need to better visualize the regular pentagon. Let&#39;s label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E in order. Then, for vertex A, the adjacent sides are AB and EA. The next sides are BC and DE, and the &quot;opposite&quot; side would be CD. But since the pentagon is regular, all sides are equivalent in terms of symmetry. So, the distance from vertex A to side CD would be some value.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s better to use coordinates. Let me place the regular pentagon in a coordinate system. Let&#39;s assume the center is at the origin, and one vertex is at (1, 0). Then, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined using polar coordinates. The regular pentagon vertices are at angles 0°, 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°, right? So, converting to Cartesian coordinates, each vertex is (cos(72k°), sin(72k°)) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.Wait, but perhaps scaling so that the distance from the center to each vertex (the circumradius) is 1. Then the side length a can be calculated. The side length in terms of the circumradius R is a = 2R sin(π/5) ≈ 2 * 1 * 0.5878 ≈ 1.1756. Then the inradius r (distance from center to a side) is R cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090.So, if the center is at (0,0), then each side can be represented by a line. Let me find the equations of the sides.For example, the first side connects vertex A (1,0) to vertex B (cos 72°, sin 72°). The equation of this side can be found using two-point form. Similarly for the other sides.But maybe this is getting too computational. Let me think if there&#39;s a smarter way.Alternatively, since the regular pentagon is highly symmetric, perhaps the minimal and maximal r₃ occur at points with some symmetry. For example, the center, the vertices, midpoints of sides, or points along the axes of symmetry.The regular pentagon has five axes of symmetry: each passes through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. So, perhaps the points where r₃ is minimized or maximized lie along these axes.Alternatively, maybe the minimal r₃ occurs at the center. Let&#39;s check. At the center, all r_i are equal to the inradius, so r₁ = r₂ = r₃ = r₄ = r₅ = 0.8090 (if R=1). If we move from the center towards a side, the distance to that side decreases, and the distances to the adjacent sides might decrease as well, but the distances to the opposite sides would increase. Wait, but in a pentagon, moving towards one side might affect the distances to the other sides in a non-uniform way.Wait, let me take a specific example. Suppose we take a point moving along the axis of symmetry from the center towards a vertex. At the center, all distances are equal. As we move towards the vertex, the distance to the two adjacent sides decreases, and the distance to the opposite side (the one opposite the vertex) increases. The distances to the other two sides (the ones adjacent to the opposite side) might first decrease and then increase? Not sure. Let&#39;s try.Alternatively, moving along the axis from the center towards the midpoint of a side. Then, the distance to that side increases (since we&#39;re moving away from it?), wait, no: moving towards the midpoint of a side would decrease the distance to that side. Wait, no, the distance from the center to a side is the inradius. If we move towards the midpoint of a side, then the distance to that side decreases, right? Because we&#39;re getting closer to it, while moving away from the opposite side. Wait, but in a pentagon, moving towards a side might actually move you away from the adjacent sides?This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to use coordinates to model this.Let me consider a regular pentagon centered at the origin with a vertex at (1,0). The five vertices are at angles 0°, 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°. Let&#39;s compute their coordinates:Vertex A: (1, 0)Vertex B: (cos 72°, sin 72°) ≈ (0.3090, 0.9511)Vertex C: (cos 144°, sin 144°) ≈ (-0.8090, 0.5878)Vertex D: (cos 216°, sin 216°) ≈ (-0.8090, -0.5878)Vertex E: (cos 288°, sin 288°) ≈ (0.3090, -0.9511)Now, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EA.Let me find the equations of the sides.Starting with side AB: from (1, 0) to (0.3090, 0.9511). The slope of AB is (0.9511 - 0)/(0.3090 - 1) ≈ 0.9511 / (-0.6910) ≈ -1.3764. The equation is y - 0 = -1.3764(x - 1). So, y = -1.3764x + 1.3764.Similarly, for side BC: from (0.3090, 0.9511) to (-0.8090, 0.5878). The slope is (0.5878 - 0.9511)/(-0.8090 - 0.3090) ≈ (-0.3633)/(-1.1180) ≈ 0.3251. Equation: y - 0.9511 = 0.3251(x - 0.3090).But calculating all these equations might be tedious. Alternatively, since all sides are symmetric, maybe we can use parametric coordinates or vector methods.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of pedal coordinates or distance functions.Alternatively, think about the regular pentagon as a convex polygon. For any convex polygon, the set of points where the k-th smallest distance to the sides is maximized or minimized might have some properties.Wait, but I recall in a convex polygon, the maximum distance to a side is achieved at a vertex. But here we are dealing with the third smallest distance. Hmm.Wait, but for the third smallest distance, maybe it&#39;s related to being close to three sides? For a pentagon, each point inside is &quot;near&quot; some number of sides. The distances to the sides can be ordered, and the third one would be the median distance.Wait, if I consider the center, all distances are equal, so r₃ is equal to the inradius. If I move towards a vertex, two distances become smaller (approaching zero), and the other three distances might become larger. Therefore, in that case, r₃ would be the third smallest, which is the smallest of the larger three distances. So, as we approach the vertex, two distances go to zero, and the other three approach the distances from the vertex to the other sides.Alternatively, if we move towards the midpoint of a side, the distance to that side decreases, and the distances to the adjacent sides might increase or decrease? Wait, moving towards the midpoint of a side: the distance to that side decreases (since we&#39;re moving towards it), but the distances to the two adjacent sides might increase because we&#39;re moving away from them (since the sides are at an angle). The distances to the other two sides (the ones opposite) might decrease or increase? Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the minimal r₃ is achieved at the center, since at the center, all distances are equal, so r₃ is as high as possible? Wait, but we need to minimize r₃. Wait, if all distances are equal, then r₃ is the same as all others, which is the inradius. If we can find a point where the third smallest distance is smaller than the inradius, that would be better. Is that possible?Wait, suppose we take a point very close to a vertex. Then two distances are very small (r₁ and r₂), and the other three distances (r₃, r₄, r₅) would be the distances to the other sides. If the point is near the vertex, the distances to the two adjacent sides are approaching zero, but the distances to the other three sides would be roughly the distances from the vertex to those sides. For a regular pentagon, what is the distance from a vertex to the opposite side?Wait, let&#39;s calculate that. Take vertex A at (1,0). The opposite side is side CD, which is between points C (-0.8090, 0.5878) and D (-0.8090, -0.5878). The equation of side CD is x = -0.8090. The distance from A (1,0) to side CD is the horizontal distance from x=1 to x=-0.8090, which is 1 - (-0.8090) = 1.8090. Wait, but in a regular pentagon with circumradius 1, the distance from a vertex to the opposite side is 1.8090?Wait, but the inradius is approximately 0.8090, which is the distance from the center to a side. So the distance from a vertex to the opposite side is 1.8090, which is larger than the inradius. So if M is near vertex A, then r₁ and r₂ are approaching 0 (distances to sides AB and EA), and r₃ would be the distance to side BC, which as M approaches A, this distance approaches the distance from A to BC. Wait, but vertex A is on sides AB and EA, so the distance from A to BC is not zero. Let me calculate the distance from A (1,0) to side BC.Side BC goes from B (0.3090, 0.9511) to C (-0.8090, 0.5878). Let&#39;s find the equation of line BC.First, compute the slope: (0.5878 - 0.9511)/(-0.8090 - 0.3090) ≈ (-0.3633)/(-1.1180) ≈ 0.3251.So the equation is y - 0.9511 = 0.3251(x - 0.3090). Let&#39;s rearrange this to standard form ax + by + c = 0.Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals approximately:10000y - 9511 = 3251(x - 3090/10000). Wait, perhaps better to use exact values.Alternatively, use the formula for distance from a point to a line. The distance from point (x0, y0) to line passing through (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |(y2 - y1)x0 - (x2 - x1)y0 + x2y1 - y2x1| / sqrt((y2 - y1)^2 + (x2 - x1)^2).So for line BC, points B (0.3090, 0.9511) and C (-0.8090, 0.5878). Then,Numerator: |(0.5878 - 0.9511)x0 - (-0.8090 - 0.3090)y0 + (-0.8090)(0.9511) - 0.5878(0.3090)|Denominator: sqrt((0.5878 - 0.9511)^2 + (-0.8090 - 0.3090)^2)Compute denominator first:Δy = 0.5878 - 0.9511 ≈ -0.3633Δx = -0.8090 - 0.3090 ≈ -1.1180Denominator ≈ sqrt((-0.3633)^2 + (-1.1180)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.1320 + 1.2500) ≈ sqrt(1.382) ≈ 1.1756.Now, numerator for point A (1,0):|(-0.3633)(1) - (-1.1180)(0) + (-0.8090)(0.9511) - 0.5878(0.3090)|Compute each term:First term: -0.3633 * 1 ≈ -0.3633Second term: -(-1.1180)(0) = 0Third term: -0.8090 * 0.9511 ≈ -0.7695Fourth term: -0.5878 * 0.3090 ≈ -0.1816Wait, wait, the formula is:Numerator = |Δy * x0 - Δx * y0 + x2y1 - y2x1|So:Δy = 0.5878 - 0.9511 ≈ -0.3633Δx = -0.8090 - 0.3090 ≈ -1.1180x2 = -0.8090, y1 = 0.9511y2 = 0.5878, x1 = 0.3090So:Numerator = |-0.3633 * 1 - (-1.1180) * 0 + (-0.8090)(0.9511) - (0.5878)(0.3090)|Compute each part:First term: -0.3633 * 1 = -0.3633Second term: -(-1.1180)*0 = 0Third term: (-0.8090)(0.9511) ≈ -0.7695Fourth term: -0.5878*0.3090 ≈ -0.1816So total numerator ≈ | -0.3633 + 0 - 0.7695 - 0.1816 | ≈ | -1.3144 | ≈ 1.3144Therefore, distance ≈ 1.3144 / 1.1756 ≈ 1.1176So the distance from vertex A to side BC is approximately 1.1176. Since the circumradius is 1, this is quite a large distance.Therefore, if M is near vertex A, then r₁ and r₂ are approaching 0 (distances to AB and EA), and r₃ is approximately 1.1176. But the inradius at the center is 0.8090, which is smaller. Therefore, r₃ near the vertex is larger than the inradius. Therefore, moving towards the vertex actually increases r₃. So, maybe the maximum of r₃ occurs near the vertices?Wait, but in this case, when M is at the vertex, two distances are zero, and the remaining three distances are fixed. For vertex A, the distances to sides AB and EA are zero, and distances to BC, CD, and DE are positive. So, when M approaches the vertex, r₁ and r₂ approach zero, and r₃ approaches the smallest of the three remaining distances, which is the distance from A to BC, which we calculated as approximately 1.1176. However, in reality, when M is exactly at the vertex, the distances to the two adjacent sides are zero, but the distances to the other three sides are fixed. Therefore, the ordered distances would be r₁ = 0, r₂ = 0, r₃ = distance to BC, r₄ = distance to CD, r₅ = distance to DE. So, r₃ at a vertex is the distance to the next non-adjacent side.But this seems like a large value compared to the inradius. So, perhaps the maximum value of r₃ is achieved at the vertices? But wait, if we move along the edge near the vertex, maybe the third distance can be even larger?Wait, if we take a point along the side AB, near vertex A. The distance to AB is zero, the distance to EA is approaching zero as we approach A, and the distances to the other three sides (BC, CD, DE) would be increasing as we move away from the center? Wait, no, moving towards vertex A along AB, the distance to AB is zero, the distance to EA (the other adjacent side) is approaching zero, and the distance to BC, CD, DE... Hmm, actually, as we move towards A along AB, we are moving away from the opposite sides. Wait, but AB is adjacent to BC and EA. So, moving towards A, the distance to BC might decrease? Wait, no. Let me think.Suppose we take a point on side AB, very close to A. The distance to AB is zero. The distance to EA is the distance from that point to EA, which is the same as the distance from the point to vertex A, since EA is adjacent to A. Wait, if the point is on AB near A, then the distance to EA is the distance from the point to EA. But EA is the side from E to A. So, if the point is on AB near A, the distance to EA is the perpendicular distance to EA. Since EA is another side adjacent to A, forming a 108-degree angle with AB. So, the distance from a point on AB near A to EA would be the length of the perpendicular from that point to EA.Given that AB and EA meet at A with an internal angle of 108 degrees. If I take a point on AB at a small distance ε from A, then the perpendicular distance to EA would be ε * sin(108°). Because the angle between AB and EA is 108°, so the perpendicular distance would be ε * sin(θ), where θ is 108°.Therefore, as ε approaches 0, the distance to EA approaches 0 as well. Wait, but that seems contradictory. If the point is on AB, then the distance to AB is zero, but the distance to EA would depend on the position. Wait, no: if the point is on AB, its distance to AB is zero, but to compute the distance to EA, which is another side, you need to compute the perpendicular distance to EA.Wait, let me visualize this. Suppose I have a regular pentagon, and I take a point on side AB very close to vertex A. This point is on AB, so distance to AB is zero. The distance to EA is the perpendicular distance from this point to EA. Since EA is adjacent to A, and the angle at A is 108°, the side EA is at 108° from AB.Therefore, the perpendicular distance from the point near A on AB to EA is the length of the altitude from that point to EA. Since the point is very close to A, this distance should be approximately equal to the length of the segment from A perpendicular to EA, which is zero because A is on EA. Wait, but A is a vertex where EA meets AB. Therefore, the distance from A to EA is zero. But if the point is on AB near A, the perpendicular distance to EA is not zero unless the point is on EA as well. But EA and AB intersect only at A. Therefore, for a point on AB not at A, the distance to EA is non-zero.Wait, maybe I need to calculate this distance. Let&#39;s take a point on AB at a small distance ε from A. Let&#39;s parameterize AB. The coordinates of A are (1, 0), and B is (cos 72°, sin 72°) ≈ (0.3090, 0.9511). So, the parametric equation of AB is (1 - t, 0 + t*(0.3090 - 1), 0 + t*(0.9511 - 0)) for t from 0 to 1. So, a point near A would have t ≈ 0, say t = ε. Then, the coordinates are (1 - ε*(1 - 0.3090), 0 + ε*0.9511) ≈ (1 - 0.6910ε, 0.9511ε).Now, we need to find the distance from this point to side EA. Side EA connects E (0.3090, -0.9511) to A (1, 0). Let&#39;s find the equation of EA.The slope of EA is (0 - (-0.9511))/(1 - 0.3090) ≈ 0.9511/0.6910 ≈ 1.3764. So the equation is y - (-0.9511) = 1.3764(x - 0.3090), which simplifies to y + 0.9511 = 1.3764x - 0.4255, so y = 1.3764x - 0.4255 - 0.9511 ≈ 1.3764x - 1.3766.Now, the distance from the point (1 - 0.6910ε, 0.9511ε) to line EA: ax + by + c = 0. The line EA can be written as 1.3764x - y - 1.3766 = 0. So, a = 1.3764, b = -1, c = -1.3766.The distance formula is |a x0 + b y0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). Plugging in the point (1 - 0.6910ε, 0.9511ε):Distance = |1.3764*(1 - 0.6910ε) - 1*(0.9511ε) - 1.3766| / sqrt(1.3764² + 1)Compute numerator:1.3764*1 - 1.3764*0.6910ε - 0.9511ε - 1.3766≈ (1.3764 - 1.3766) + (-1.3764*0.6910 - 0.9511)ε≈ (-0.0002) + (-0.9511 - 0.9511)ε≈ -0.0002 - 1.9022εThe absolute value is approximately | -0.0002 - 1.9022ε | ≈ 0.0002 + 1.9022εDenominator: sqrt(1.3764² + 1) ≈ sqrt(1.8943 + 1) ≈ sqrt(2.8943) ≈ 1.7013Therefore, the distance is approximately (0.0002 + 1.9022ε)/1.7013 ≈ (0.0001 + 1.1180ε)So, as ε approaches 0, the distance to EA approaches approximately 0.0001, which is practically zero. Wait, but this seems contradictory. If the point is on AB near A, the distance to EA should approach the distance from A to EA, which is zero because A is on EA. But in reality, the distance from a point on AB (not at A) to EA is along the perpendicular, which isn&#39;t zero unless the point is on EA. Since AB and EA intersect only at A, the distance from points on AB near A to EA approaches zero as the point approaches A.Therefore, if M approaches vertex A along AB, then r₁ = 0 (distance to AB), r₂ approaches 0 (distance to EA), and the other three distances (to BC, CD, DE) approach fixed values. Specifically, the distance to BC approaches the distance from A to BC, which we calculated earlier as approximately 1.1176, the distance to CD is the distance from A to CD, and the distance to DE is the distance from A to DE.But actually, since A is a vertex, the distances from A to BC, CD, and DE are fixed. Let me compute these.We already computed the distance from A to BC as ≈1.1176. Let&#39;s compute the distance from A to CD.Side CD is between C (-0.8090, 0.5878) and D (-0.8090, -0.5878). The equation of CD is x = -0.8090. The distance from A (1,0) to CD is |1 - (-0.8090)| = 1.8090.Distance from A to DE: side DE connects D (-0.8090, -0.5878) to E (0.3090, -0.9511). Let&#39;s find the equation of DE. The slope is (-0.9511 - (-0.5878))/(0.3090 - (-0.8090)) ≈ (-0.3633)/(1.1180) ≈ -0.3251. The equation is y - (-0.5878) = -0.3251(x - (-0.8090)), which simplifies to y + 0.5878 = -0.3251x - 0.2627, so y = -0.3251x - 0.2627 - 0.5878 ≈ -0.3251x - 0.8505.Using the distance formula from A (1,0) to this line:| -0.3251*1 - 1*0 - 0.8505 | / sqrt((-0.3251)^2 + (-1)^2) ≈ | -0.3251 - 0.8505 | / sqrt(0.1057 + 1) ≈ | -1.1756 | / 1.051 ≈ 1.1756 / 1.051 ≈ 1.118.So, the distance from A to DE is approximately 1.118, similar to the distance to BC.Therefore, the distances from A to BC, CD, DE are approximately 1.1176, 1.8090, and 1.118. Therefore, when M is at vertex A, the distances are:r₁ = 0 (AB), r₂ = 0 (EA), r₃ ≈1.1176 (BC), r₄ ≈1.118 (DE), r₅ ≈1.8090 (CD).So, r₃ at vertex A is approximately 1.1176.But earlier, when considering the inradius at the center (≈0.8090), that&#39;s smaller. Therefore, if we want to minimize r₃, perhaps the center is the point where r₃ is minimized? But wait, when M is at the center, all r_i are equal to 0.8090. So, r₃ is 0.8090. If we can find a point where r₃ is less than 0.8090, that would be better. Is that possible?Suppose we take a point inside the pentagon but not at the center. Let&#39;s say we move towards a side. Then, the distance to that side decreases, becoming smaller than 0.8090, but the distances to the other sides might increase. However, when we order the distances, if three of them are greater than or equal to 0.8090, then r₃ could still be 0.8090 or higher. Wait, but if we move towards a side, one distance becomes smaller, but maybe two others also decrease?Wait, in a pentagon, moving towards one side might bring you closer to two sides and farther from the other three? Let me think.Imagine moving from the center towards the midpoint of a side. The distance to that side decreases. The two adjacent sides: since the pentagon is convex, moving towards the midpoint of a side might actually move you away from the two adjacent sides? Wait, no. The adjacent sides are at an angle, so moving towards the midpoint of one side would bring you closer to that side but also closer to the adjacent sides? Hmm, I need to visualize this.Alternatively, take a point near the center but slightly towards side AB. The distance to AB decreases, but the distances to adjacent sides BC and EA might also decrease or increase? Let&#39;s take coordinates. Suppose the center is (0,0), and side AB is at the top. Moving towards AB from the center along the vertical axis. The distance to AB decreases, but the distances to BC and EA would depend on the direction. Since moving vertically up, the distance to AB decreases, but the horizontal distances to BC and EA might increase or decrease?Wait, in a regular pentagon, the sides are not aligned with the axes unless we rotate it. Let me consider a pentagon with one side horizontal at the top. The center is at (0,0). The top side AB is horizontal, and the other sides are below it.Wait, this might complicate things. Alternatively, use vector analysis.Alternatively, consider that in a regular pentagon, the distance from a point to a side is a linear function within the pentagon. Therefore, the functions r_i(M) are linear functions, and we&#39;re looking to minimize/maximize the third smallest among these linear functions.This is similar to an optimization problem where we want the third order statistic of five linear functions. The minimum of r₃ would occur at a point where three of the distance functions intersect, i.e., a point where three distances are equal and are the third smallest. Similarly, the maximum would occur where three distances are equal but are the third largest.Wait, perhaps the minimal r₃ is achieved at the center where all distances are equal, but since moving towards a side would decrease one distance but might increase others, but if three distances can be made smaller, then r₃ could be smaller.Alternatively, maybe not. Since in the center, all are equal. If we move in some direction, one distance decreases, but others increase. So, the third smallest would still be at least the minimal value among the increased distances. Hmm, this is getting abstract.Wait, perhaps consider that the minimal value of r₃ is the inradius, achieved only at the center. Because if you move away from the center, at least three distances will be larger than the inradius. Wait, but is that true?Suppose we take a point near the center. Let&#39;s say we perturb the center slightly towards side AB. Then, the distance to AB becomes slightly less than the inradius, and the distances to the adjacent sides (BC and EA) become slightly more than the inradius, while the distances to the other two sides (CD and DE) might become slightly less or more?Wait, no. If you move towards AB, you are moving away from the opposite sides CD and DE. Therefore, the distance to AB decreases, distances to BC and EA might slightly increase (since you&#39;re moving towards AB but away from BC and EA?), and distances to CD and DE increase.Wait, let me think in terms of coordinates. Suppose the center is at (0,0), and we move a small distance δ along the axis towards side AB. The distance to AB becomes (original inradius - δ). The distance to the opposite sides (CD and DE) becomes (original inradius + δ), and distances to adjacent sides (BC and EA) might remain roughly the same? Wait, not exactly, because moving along the axis towards AB affects the distances to other sides depending on their orientation.Alternatively, maybe each axis of symmetry is orthogonal to a side. So, moving along the axis towards AB affects primarily the distance to AB and the opposite side. Wait, in a regular pentagon, each axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. Therefore, moving along the axis from the center towards a vertex would affect the distances to the two adjacent sides and the opposite side.Alternatively, moving along the axis towards the midpoint of a side would affect the distance to that side and the opposite vertex.This is getting too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.Let me recall that in regular polygons, the concept of the pedal polygon or the distance sum might be relevant, but here we&#39;re dealing with order statistics of distances.Alternatively, consider that for any convex polygon, the maximum of the k-th smallest distance function might occur at a vertex, but I need to verify.Alternatively, use the concept of Chebyshev center, which is the center of the largest inscribed circle. In a regular pentagon, the Chebyshev center is the same as the center of the pentagon, with radius equal to the inradius. The Chebyshev center minimizes the maximum distance to the sides, but here we need the third smallest distance.Wait, perhaps the minimal r₃ is achieved at the Chebyshev center (the center of the pentagon), because there all distances are equal to the inradius. If you move from the center, then one distance becomes smaller (which would be r₁), another becomes slightly smaller (r₂), and the third distance (r₃) would be the next one. But depending on the direction, maybe r₃ could be smaller or larger.Wait, suppose we move from the center towards a vertex. Then, two distances (to the adjacent sides) decrease, and the distance to the opposite side increases. The other two distances (to the remaining sides) may increase or decrease. Therefore, when moving towards a vertex, r₁ and r₂ are decreasing, while r₃ could be the next smallest distance, which might be decreasing or increasing.But in reality, moving towards a vertex, the distances to the adjacent sides decrease, but the distances to the other three sides increase. Therefore, when moving from the center towards a vertex, the first two distances decrease, but the other three increase. Therefore, r₃ would be the smallest of the three increasing distances, which is larger than the inradius. Therefore, moving towards a vertex increases r₃ above the inradius. Therefore, the minimal r₃ is at the center.Similarly, moving towards the midpoint of a side, the distance to that side decreases, distances to adjacent sides might increase or decrease? Wait, moving towards the midpoint of a side, you are moving away from the opposite vertex. The distance to the side you&#39;re moving towards decreases, distances to the two adjacent sides might increase (since you&#39;re moving away from their midpoints), and distances to the other two sides (opposite) increase. Therefore, similar to moving towards a vertex: r₁ decreases, r₂ and r₃ (which would be the next smallest distances) might start increasing. Wait, maybe in this case, r₃ could be lower? Not sure.Wait, perhaps the minimal value of r₃ is achieved when three distances are equal and minimal. If such a point exists where three distances are equal and less than the inradius, that would be the minimal r₃. But in a regular pentagon, is there a point inside where three distances to sides are equal and less than the inradius?Alternatively, perhaps not. Because the inradius is the maximal minimal distance. Wait, the inradius is the distance from the center to any side, and any point inside has at least one distance less than or equal to the inradius. But we are considering the third smallest distance.Wait, perhaps the third smallest distance cannot be smaller than the inradius. Because if the inradius is the minimal maximum distance, but here we&#39;re taking the third smallest. If we have a point where three distances are equal and greater than the inradius, then r₃ would be higher. Wait, this is confusing.Alternatively, consider that at the center, all five distances are equal to the inradius, so r₃ is equal to the inradius. If we move in any direction, one distance becomes less than the inradius, and others become more. Therefore, the third smallest distance, r₃, would now be the inradius. Wait, no: if one distance becomes less, and others become more, then the ordering would be r₁ (the decreased one), then the next four distances might still be around the inradius? Wait, no. If you move a small distance δ towards a side, then one distance becomes inradius - δ, and the opposite side&#39;s distance becomes inradius + δ, while the adjacent sides&#39; distances change by some amount depending on the angle.But given the pentagon&#39;s angles, moving towards a side would cause the distance to that side to decrease, the distance to the opposite side to increase, and the distances to the two adjacent sides to decrease or increase?Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s take a regular pentagon and imagine moving from the center towards the midpoint of a side. The distance to that side decreases. The two adjacent sides are each at 72 degrees from the moved direction. Therefore, moving towards the midpoint of a side would decrease the distance to that side and have a component towards the adjacent sides, but since the movement is along the axis of symmetry, maybe the distances to the adjacent sides remain the same? Wait, no, because the axis of symmetry goes through the midpoint of the side and the opposite vertex. So moving along that axis would affect the distance to the side you&#39;re moving towards and the opposite vertex, but how does it affect the adjacent sides?Alternatively, perhaps the distances to the adjacent sides increase because moving towards the midpoint of a side moves you away from the adjacent sides. Let me consider a coordinate system where the pentagon is centered at the origin, and we are moving along the y-axis towards the top side.Suppose the top side is horizontal. Moving upwards from the center, the distance to the top side decreases, but the distances to the two adjacent sides (left and right top) might increase because you&#39;re moving away from them. The distances to the bottom sides would increase as well.Wait, in such a case, moving upwards, the distance to the top side decreases, and distances to all other sides increase. Therefore, the ordered distances would be r₁ = distance to top side, r₂ and r₃ = next smallest distances, which would be the distances to the adjacent sides, which are increasing as you move up. Therefore, in this case, r₃ (the third smallest) is the distance to one of the adjacent sides, which is increasing. Therefore, moving up from the center, r₁ decreases, but r₃ increases. Therefore, the minimal value of r₃ is at the center.Similarly, moving towards a vertex, two distances decrease (to the adjacent sides), but the other three distances increase. Therefore, r₃ would be the smallest of the three increased distances, which is still larger than the inradius.Therefore, perhaps the minimal r₃ is achieved uniquely at the center, where all distances are equal to the inradius.Now, for the maximum value of r₃. Where could that occur? Earlier, we saw that at a vertex, r₃ is approximately 1.1176 (if the inradius is 0.8090). But is this the maximum possible?Alternatively, maybe there is a point where three distances are equal and larger than the vertex value. To check this, perhaps consider points outside the pentagon, but M must be inside or on the boundary.Wait, the problem states M is inside or on the boundary. So we can&#39;t go outside.Alternatively, consider points along an edge. For example, take a point on a side, but not at a vertex. Let&#39;s say the midpoint of a side. At the midpoint, the distance to that side is zero, the distances to the two adjacent sides are equal, and the distances to the other two sides can be calculated.Wait, let&#39;s compute the distances from the midpoint of a side to the other sides. Let&#39;s take the midpoint of side AB, which is the point halfway between A (1,0) and B (0.3090, 0.9511). The midpoint M has coordinates ((1 + 0.3090)/2, (0 + 0.9511)/2) ≈ (0.6545, 0.4756).Now, compute the distances from this midpoint to all five sides.First, distance to AB is zero.Distance to BC: Compute the distance from M (0.6545, 0.4756) to side BC. As before, side BC is between B (0.3090, 0.9511) and C (-0.8090, 0.5878). The equation of BC is y - 0.9511 = 0.3251(x - 0.3090). Using the distance formula:Distance = |0.3251*(0.6545) - 1*(0.4756) + ( -0.3251*0.3090 + 0.9511)| / sqrt(0.3251² + (-1)²)Compute numerator:0.3251*0.6545 ≈ 0.2126-1*0.4756 = -0.4756-0.3251*0.3090 ≈ -0.1005So total numerator: |0.2126 - 0.4756 - 0.1005 + 0.9511| ≈ |0.2126 - 0.4756 - 0.1005 + 0.9511| ≈ |0.5876| ≈ 0.5876Denominator: sqrt(0.1057 + 1) ≈ 1.051Distance ≈ 0.5876 / 1.051 ≈ 0.559.Distance to DE: Let&#39;s compute the distance from M to side DE. Side DE connects D (-0.8090, -0.5878) to E (0.3090, -0.9511). The equation of DE is y = -0.3251x - 0.8505 (from earlier). Plugging in M (0.6545, 0.4756):Distance = | -0.3251*0.6545 - 1*0.4756 - 0.8505 | / sqrt(0.3251² + 1)Compute numerator:-0.3251*0.6545 ≈ -0.2126-0.4756-0.8505Total ≈ |-0.2126 -0.4756 -0.8505| ≈ |-1.5387| ≈1.5387Denominator ≈1.051 as before.Distance ≈1.5387 /1.051≈1.463.Distance to CD: Side CD is x = -0.8090. The distance from M (0.6545, 0.4756) to CD is |0.6545 - (-0.8090)| = 1.4635.Distance to EA: Side EA connects E (0.3090, -0.9511) to A (1,0). The equation is y =1.3764x -1.3766. Distance from M (0.6545, 0.4756):|1.3764*0.6545 -1*0.4756 -1.3766| / sqrt(1.3764² +1)Compute numerator:1.3764*0.6545 ≈0.899-0.4756 -1.3766≈-1.8522Total ≈ |0.899 -1.8522| ≈0.9532Denominator≈sqrt(1.8943 +1)≈1.7013Distance≈0.9532 /1.7013≈0.560.Therefore, the distances from midpoint M of side AB are:r₁ = 0 (AB)r₂ ≈0.559 (BC)r₃≈0.560 (EA)r₄≈1.463 (CD)r₅≈1.4635 (distance to CD)Wait, actually, the distance to EA was calculated as≈0.56, and to CD≈1.4635. So the ordering is 0, 0.559, 0.560, 1.463, 1.4635. Therefore, r₃ ≈0.560, which is larger than the inradius of 0.8090? Wait, no, 0.56 is less than 0.8090. Wait, this contradicts earlier assumption.Wait, but the inradius is the distance from the center to a side, which is 0.8090. However, at the midpoint of a side, the distance to that side is zero, and the distances to other sides can be less than or greater than the inradius.Wait, but at the midpoint of side AB, the distance to side AB is zero, the distances to adjacent sides BC and EA are approximately 0.559 and 0.560, which are less than the inradius. The distances to the other sides CD and DE are approximately 1.463 and 1.4635, which are greater than the inradius. Therefore, in this case, the ordered distances are 0, 0.559, 0.560, 1.463, 1.4635. Therefore, r₃ is 0.560, which is less than the inradius. Therefore, this suggests that there are points where r₃ is less than the inradius, which contradicts my previous conclusion.But wait, this can&#39;t be, because if I take the center, all distances are 0.8090. If I move towards a side, the distance to that side becomes less than 0.8090, but the distances to the adjacent sides also decrease? Wait, in this case, at the midpoint of AB, the distance to AB is zero, and distances to BC and EA are 0.559 and 0.560, which are less than the inradius. Then, the third smallest distance, r₃, is 0.560, which is less than the inradius. Therefore, the minimal r₃ is not achieved at the center, but at the midpoint of the sides?But this contradicts the previous thought that moving towards a side would only decrease one distance. However, in reality, moving towards a side also brings you closer to the adjacent sides, thus decreasing their distances as well.Wait, let me verify this. Take the midpoint of AB. Since AB is a side of the pentagon, the midpoint is equidistant to AB and to the adjacent sides BC and EA? Wait, no. The distance to AB is zero, but the distances to BC and EA are non-zero. But in a regular pentagon, the distance from the midpoint of a side to the adjacent sides is actually equal to half the length of the apothem?Wait, the apothem (inradius) is the distance from the center to a side. The midpoint of a side is located at a distance of inradius from the center? No, the midpoint of a side is further out. Wait, in a regular pentagon, the distance from the center to a vertex is the circumradius R, and the distance from the center to a side is the inradius r = R cos(π/5). The distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is the inradius, right? Because the midpoint of a side is where the apothem touches the side.Wait, no, actually, the midpoint of a side is located at a distance of inradius from the center. Therefore, if the center is at (0,0), and the midpoint of side AB is at (0, r), then moving from the center to the midpoint of AB is along the inradius direction.Wait, but in that case, the distance from the midpoint of AB to side AB is zero, and the distance from the midpoint to the center is r. Therefore, the distance from the midpoint to the adjacent sides BC and EA should be equal to the inradius times some factor.Wait, maybe my previous calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate the distance from the midpoint of AB to side BC.Let me take the regular pentagon with circumradius R=1 for simplicity. Then, the inradius r = cos(π/5) ≈0.8090. The midpoint of side AB is located at a distance r from the center, along the axis perpendicular to AB.But actually, in a regular pentagon, the midpoint of a side is exactly at the inradius distance from the center. Therefore, the distance from the midpoint of AB to the center is r. Therefore, the distance from the midpoint to any other side should be calculable.Wait, but when I calculated earlier, using coordinates, the distance from the midpoint of AB to BC was approximately 0.559, but if the inradius is 0.8090, how can this be?Ah, maybe because of the coordinate system scaling. If the circumradius is 1, then the inradius is cos(π/5) ≈0.8090, and the side length a is 2 sin(π/5) ≈1.1756.But when I calculated the distance from midpoint M (0.6545, 0.4756) to BC, I got approximately 0.559. However, if the inradius is 0.8090, which is the distance from the center to a side, then the distance from the midpoint of AB (which is at distance r from the center) to BC should be more than r, but my calculation gave less. Therefore, there must be an error in my coordinate calculations.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate system. Let me clarify.If the regular pentagon has a circumradius R = 1 (distance from center to vertices), then the coordinates of the vertices are as I listed before. The inradius (distance from center to sides) is r = R cos(π/5) ≈0.8090.The midpoint of a side is the point where the inradius touches the side. Therefore, the midpoint of side AB is located at a distance r from the center, along the line perpendicular to AB. Therefore, if AB is a horizontal side at the top of the pentagon, the midpoint of AB is at (0, r). But in my coordinate system earlier, the vertices are placed with one vertex at (1,0), so the midpoint of AB would not be at (0, r). Therefore, the coordinate system I used earlier has a different orientation.This confusion arises because placing the pentagon with a vertex at (1,0) results in sides that are not aligned with the axes. Therefore, the midpoint of a side isn&#39;t along an axis but at some angle.Therefore, my earlier coordinate calculations might not have been scaled correctly. Let me instead consider a regular pentagon with inradius r = 1 for simplicity. Then, the distance from the center to each side is 1. The side length a is 2 tan(π/5) ≈1.453. The circumradius R is r / cos(π/5) ≈1 / 0.8090 ≈1.2361.In this case, the midpoint of each side is exactly 1 unit from the center. If I take a point M at the midpoint of a side, the distance to that side is 0, and the distances to the other sides can be calculated.But how?Alternatively, use symmetry. In a regular pentagon with inradius 1, the distance from the midpoint of a side to the adjacent sides can be computed using trigonometry.Consider the regular pentagon, and look at the triangle formed by the center, the midpoint of a side, and the midpoint of an adjacent side. The angle at the center between two adjacent midpoints is 72 degrees. The distance from the center to each midpoint is 1 (the inradius). The distance between two adjacent midpoints is 2 sin(36°) ≈1.1756 (since the angle between them is 72°, and the triangle is isosceles with two sides of length 1).But the distance from the midpoint of a side to the adjacent side is the height of this triangle. Wait, no. The adjacent side is not the same as the adjacent midpoint.Alternatively, consider the midpoint M of side AB. The adjacent sides are BC and EA. To find the distance from M to BC, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line.Given that the regular pentagon has inradius 1, and the center is at O. The midpoint M is 1 unit from O. The side BC is located at a certain position. The distance from M to BC would require knowing the equation of BC.Alternatively, consider that in a regular pentagon, the distance from the midpoint of a side to an adjacent side is equal to the inradius times (1 - cos(72°)). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, use the law of cosines.The angle between the line connecting the center to the midpoint of AB (which is length 1) and the line from the midpoint of AB to side BC is 36°, since the angle between adjacent sides is 108°, and the midpoint is halfway along the side.Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe it&#39;s better to use coordinates again, but with inradius 1.Let me define a regular pentagon with inradius 1. The circumradius R = 1 / cos(π/5) ≈1.2361. The side length a = 2 tan(π/5) ≈1.453.Let&#39;s place the pentagon with the center at (0,0), and one side horizontal at the top. The vertices are then at angles 18°, 90°, 162°, 234°, 306° (since each vertex is 72° apart, starting from the top). Wait, no. If we want a side horizontal at the top, the vertices should be placed such that one side is horizontal. The angle for each vertex would be offset by 72°, starting from the top.Wait, but to have a horizontal side at the top, we need to adjust the angles. The vertices of a regular pentagon with one side horizontal at the top would be at angles 0°, 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°, but rotated such that one side is horizontal. Alternatively, perhaps the vertices are at angles 54°, 126°, 198°, 270°, 342°, so that the sides are horizontal and vertical.This is getting too complicated. Perhaps use a different approach.Let me consider that in a regular pentagon with inradius r =1, the distance from the midpoint of a side to an adjacent side is d. We need to find d.In a regular pentagon, the angle between the line from the center to a vertex and the line from the center to the midpoint of a side is 36° (since each central angle is 72°, and the midpoint is halfway).Therefore, the distance from the midpoint M of a side to an adjacent side can be found using trigonometry. The line from M to the adjacent side forms a right triangle with the center.Let me draw this. From midpoint M, the distance to the adjacent side BC is the length of the perpendicular from M to BC. The angle between OM (length 1) and the perpendicular to BC is 36°, since the midpoint M is 36° away from the vertex.Therefore, the distance d = 1 * sin(36°) ≈0.5878. Therefore, if the inradius is 1, the distance from the midpoint of a side to an adjacent side is approximately 0.5878. Therefore, in this case, the third smallest distance r₃ would be approximately 0.5878, which is less than the inradius of 1. This suggests that my previous coordinate calculation (where r₃ was 0.56 when inradius was 0.8090) is consistent, since 0.56 ≈0.5878 *0.8090/1 ≈0.476. Hmm, not exactly, but perhaps due to scaling.Wait, if inradius r =0.8090 (as in the circumradius R=1 case), then the distance from midpoint to adjacent side would be r * sin(36°) ≈0.8090 *0.5878≈0.4756, which matches the coordinate calculation (0.559 was approximate due to decimal precision). Therefore, in the R=1 case, the distance from midpoint of a side to an adjacent side is≈0.4756, which is less than the inradius of 0.8090. Therefore, at the midpoint of a side, r₁=0 (distance to the side), r₂≈0.4756 (distance to one adjacent side), r₃≈0.4756 (distance to the other adjacent side), and then larger distances to the other sides.Therefore, in this case, r₃≈0.4756, which is less than the inradius. Therefore, the minimal r₃ occurs at the midpoints of the sides, not at the center.This contradicts my previous conclusion. Therefore, my earlier reasoning was incorrect. Therefore, I need to reassess.So, at the center, all distances are equal to the inradius (0.8090). At the midpoint of a side, the third smallest distance is≈0.4756, which is less than the inradius. Therefore, the minimal r₃ is lower at the midpoint than at the center. Therefore, the minimal r₃ occurs at the midpoints of the sides.But wait, what happens if we move from the midpoint towards the center? The distance to the side increases from 0 to the inradius, and the distances to the adjacent sides decrease from≈0.4756 to the inradius. Therefore, the ordered distances would change. When moving from the midpoint towards the center, r₁ increases (distance to the side), r₂ and r₃ (distances to adjacent sides) increase as well. Wait, no. Wait, moving from midpoint towards center: distance to the side increases, distances to adjacent sides decrease, since you&#39;re moving towards the center.Wait, let&#39;s think. At the midpoint of a side, distance to that side is 0, distances to adjacent sides are≈0.4756, distance to the other two sides are larger. Moving towards the center, the distance to the initial side increases, the distances to adjacent sides decrease (since you&#39;re moving towards the center, which is equidistant to all sides). Therefore, at some point between the midpoint and the center, the distance to the initial side becomes equal to the distances to the adjacent sides. At that point, r₁, r₂, r₃ would all be equal. Perhaps this is the point where r₃ is minimized?Wait, but when moving from the midpoint towards the center, the distances to the adjacent sides (which were r₂ and r₃) decrease, and the distance to the original side (r₁) increases. Therefore, the minimal value of r₃ would occur at the midpoint, where it is≈0.4756. Moving towards the center, r₃ increases to the inradius. Therefore, the minimal r₃ is at the midpoint.Similarly, moving from the midpoint towards the vertex along the side, the distance to the side remains zero, but the distances to the adjacent sides increase. Therefore, r₃ would increase as well.Therefore, the minimal r₃ occurs at the midpoints of the sides, with r₃≈0.4756 when inradius≈0.8090. Therefore, the minimal r₃ is achieved at the midpoints of the sides.Similarly, let&#39;s check another point. Take a point along the axis from the center to a vertex. At the vertex, r₃ is≈1.1176 (as calculated earlier). At the center, r₃ is≈0.8090. Therefore, along this axis, r₃ increases from 0.8090 to 1.1176 as we move from the center to the vertex. Therefore, the maximum value of r₃ might occur at the vertices.But need to verify if there are other points where r₃ is larger.Suppose we take a point on the extension of a side beyond the midpoint, but since M must be inside or on the boundary, we can&#39;t go beyond the midpoint.Alternatively, consider a point near a vertex but inside the pentagon. As M approaches the vertex, two distances approach zero, and r₃ approaches the distance from the vertex to the nearest non-adjacent side, which we calculated earlier as≈1.1176. Therefore, the maximum r₃ is achieved at the vertices.But wait, let&#39;s take a point inside the pentagon but not at a vertex. Suppose we take a point along the axis from the center to a vertex, but not at the vertex. For example, at a distance d from the center towards the vertex. The distances to the two adjacent sides decrease, and the distances to the other three sides increase. Therefore, r₃ is the smallest of the three increasing distances. As d increases, this smallest of the three increases. Therefore, the maximum r₃ along this axis is achieved at the vertex.Similarly, consider points inside the pentagon not on the axes. For example, points where three distances are equal. If such a point exists where three distances are equal and larger than the vertex value, then r₃ could be larger. However, due to the pentagon&#39;s symmetry, such points are likely to be the vertices themselves.Therefore, tentatively, the maximum r₃ occurs at the vertices, and the minimum r₃ occurs at the midpoints of the sides.But wait, in the earlier example, the midpoint of a side has r₃≈0.4756, but the inradius is≈0.8090, which is larger. So this seems like a good candidate for the minimal r₃.However, another thought: if we take a point near the midpoint of a side but slightly towards an adjacent side, would that decrease r₃ further?Wait, no. Because moving from the midpoint towards an adjacent side would increase the distance to the original side (which was zero at the midpoint) and decrease the distance to the adjacent side. Therefore, r₁ would increase, and r₂ would decrease. But since we are considering the third smallest distance, if we move slightly towards an adjacent side, r₁ increases to some value, r₂ decreases, but r₃ would now be the next smallest distance, which could be the distance to the other adjacent side or another side. Therefore, it&#39;s possible that the minimal r₃ is indeed achieved exactly at the midpoints of the sides, where two adjacent distances are equal and minimal, and the third is slightly higher.Alternatively, perhaps there are points inside the pentagon where three distances are equal and lower than at the midpoints. For example, equilateral points where three distances are equal. But in a regular pentagon, due to its symmetry, such points might coincide with the midpoints or vertices.Alternatively, consider the intersection of three angle bisectors. In a regular pentagon, the intersection of angle bisectors is the center. But the center has all distances equal.Alternatively, think about the dual problem: to minimize the third smallest distance, you want three distances to be as small as possible, but since the pentagon is convex, you can&#39;t have three sides close to a point unless it&#39;s near a vertex or a midpoint.Wait, near a vertex, two distances are small, but the third is larger. Near a midpoint, one distance is zero, and two are small. So in both cases, the third distance is larger than the minimal possible. Wait, no: at the midpoint, the third distance is the next smallest, which is to another side.Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the lower envelope of the distance functions. The third smallest distance would be determined by the third closest side. To minimize this, we need to be close to three sides. In a regular pentagon, can a point be close to three sides simultaneously?In a regular pentagon, the minimal distance to three sides would be achieved at a point where three sides are &#39;close&#39;. But since the pentagon has five sides, and they are arranged with angles of 108°, it&#39;s challenging to be close to three sides unless the point is near the center. But at the center, all distances are equal, so you are equally close to all five sides.However, if you move towards a side, you become closer to that side and two adjacent sides, but how?Wait, no. Moving towards a side, you become closer to that side but move away from the two sides adjacent to it due to the angle. For example, moving towards side AB, you are moving away from sides BC and EA because of the 108° angle at vertices B and A.Therefore, it&#39;s difficult to be close to three sides simultaneously. The only point where three distances are equal might be the center, but there all five distances are equal.Alternatively, maybe the midpoints of the sides are the points where you are closest to three sides: the side itself (distance zero) and the two adjacent sides (distance≈0.4756). Therefore, at the midpoint of a side, you are closest to three sides: the side you&#39;re on and the two adjacent sides, but actually, the distance to the two adjacent sides is≈0.4756, while the distances to the other two sides are larger.Therefore, in terms of the ordered distances, at the midpoint, you have r₁=0, r₂≈0.4756, r₃≈0.4756, and then r₄ and r₅ larger. Therefore, the third smallest distance is≈0.4756.If you move from the midpoint towards the center, the distance to the original side increases, and the distances to the adjacent sides decrease. Therefore, r₁ increases from 0 to the inradius, r₂ and r₃ decrease from≈0.4756 to the inradius. Wait, no. If you move towards the center, you are moving away from the original side (distance increases) and moving towards the center, so distances to all sides tend to the inradius. Wait, this is confusing.Wait, no. When moving from the midpoint towards the center, the distance to the original side (which was zero at the midpoint) increases, but the distances to the other sides decrease or increase?Wait, take midpoint of side AB at distance r from the center. Moving towards the center (along the axis perpendicular to AB), the distance to AB increases, while the distances to BC and EA (the adjacent sides) decrease, since you&#39;re moving towards the center, which is equidistant to all sides. The distances to CD and DE (the other two sides) decrease as well.Wait, no. Moving towards the center from the midpoint of AB, you are moving away from AB but towards the other sides. Therefore, the distance to AB increases, and distances to all other sides decrease.Therefore, the ordered distances at points along this path would have r₁ (distance to AB) increasing, and the other four distances (to BC, CD, DE, EA) decreasing. Therefore, the third smallest distance r₃ would be among the decreasing distances. Therefore, as you move from the midpoint to the center, r₃ decreases until it reaches the inradius, where all distances are equal.Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation where at the midpoint, r₃ is≈0.4756, and at the center, r₃ is≈0.8090. Therefore, moving from midpoint to center, r₃ increases from≈0.4756 to≈0.8090, which suggests that the minimal r₃ is at the midpoint.But how does this happen? If moving towards the center decreases the distances to all other sides, why does r₃ increase?Wait, because when you&#39;re at the midpoint, the distances to BC and EA are≈0.4756, and as you move towards the center, these distances increase to≈0.8090. Therefore, r₃, which was the third smallest distance (equal to≈0.4756 at the midpoint), becomes≈0.8090 at the center.But this contradicts the previous statement that moving towards the center decreases the distances to all other sides. Wait, no. Wait, when you move from the midpoint towards the center, you are moving away from the original side AB (distance increases from 0 to 0.8090), but moving towards the other sides, so distances to those sides decrease.Wait, no, this is a misunderstanding. If you are at the midpoint of AB, the distance to AB is zero. The distances to BC and EA are≈0.4756, and distances to CD and DE are≈1.4635.As you move towards the center, the distance to AB increases (since you&#39;re moving away from AB), and the distances to BC, EA, CD, and DE all decrease (since you&#39;re moving towards the center, which is closer to all sides). Therefore, at the center, all distances are≈0.8090. Therefore, along the path from midpoint to center:- r₁ (distance to AB) increases from 0 to≈0.8090.- r₂ and r₃ (distances to BC and EA) decrease from≈0.4756 to≈0.8090.- r₄ and r₅ (distances to CD and DE) decrease from≈1.4635 to≈0.8090.But wait, how can distances to BC and EA decrease when moving towards the center? Because BC and EA are on the &quot;other side&quot; of the pentagon relative to AB. If you move from the midpoint of AB towards the center, you are moving towards BC and EA, so their distances should decrease. However, in reality, when moving towards the center, you are moving closer to all sides except AB, which you are moving away from.Therefore, along this path, the distances to BC, EA, CD, DE all decrease, and the distance to AB increases.Therefore, ordering the distances:At the midpoint:r₁=0 (AB)r₂≈0.4756 (BC)r₃≈0.4756 (EA)r₄≈1.4635 (CD)r₅≈1.4635 (DE)As you move towards the center:r₁ increases from 0 to≈0.8090r₂ and r₃ decrease from≈0.4756 to≈0.8090r₄ and r₅ decrease from≈1.4635 to≈0.8090Therefore, the ordering of distances changes. Initially, when near the midpoint, the order is AB, BC, EA, CD, DE. As you move towards the center, the distance to AB increases, and at some point, the distance to AB surpasses the distances to BC and EA. Therefore, after that point, the order becomes BC, EA, AB, CD, DE.Therefore, during the movement, the third smallest distance r₃ transitions from EA (≈0.4756) to AB (increasing) and then to CD (decreasing). Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, consider specific points. Let&#39;s take a point halfway between the midpoint and the center.At this point, the distance to AB is≈0.4045 (half of 0.8090), and distances to BC, EA, CD, DE are≈(0.4756 +0.8090)/2≈0.6423. So, ordering the distances:r₁≈0.4045 (AB)r₂≈0.6423 (BC)r₃≈0.6423 (EA)r₄≈(1.4635 +0.8090)/2≈1.1363 (CD)r₅≈1.1363 (DE)Therefore, r₃≈0.6423, which is greater than the value at the midpoint (0.4756) but less than the inradius (0.8090).Wait, this suggests that as you move from the midpoint to the center, r₃ increases from 0.4756 to 0.8090. Therefore, the minimal r₃ is achieved at the midpoint.Similarly, if you move past the center towards the opposite side, the distance to AB continues to increase beyond the inradius, but distances to the other sides start increasing again. However, since M must stay inside the pentagon, you can&#39;t go past the center beyond the opposite side.Therefore, the minimal r₃ is achieved at the midpoints of the sides, where r₃ is the distance to the two adjacent sides, which is≈0.4756 when the inradius is≈0.8090.For the maximum value of r₃, we saw that at the vertices, r₃ is≈1.1176, which is higher than the inradius. Moving from the vertex towards the center, r₃ decreases to the inradius. Therefore, the maximal r₃ occurs at the vertices.But let&#39;s confirm with another example. Take a point inside the pentagon but not at a vertex or midpoint. For example, take a point along the axis from the center to a vertex, at a distance of 0.5 from the center. The distance to the two adjacent sides decreases, and the distance to the opposite side increases. The third smallest distance would be the smallest of the three increasing distances. As you move towards the vertex, this distance increases. Therefore, the maximum occurs at the vertices.Therefore, based on this reasoning, the minimal r₃ occurs at the midpoints of the sides, and the maximum r₃ occurs at the vertices.However, let&#39;s check if there are other points where r₃ could be larger than at the vertices. For example, consider a point on an edge adjacent to a vertex. Take a point near a vertex on a different side. But at such a point, two distances are small (to the adjacent sides), and the third distance is similar to the vertex case. Therefore, the r₃ would be similar to the vertex case.Alternatively, take a point where three distances are equal and larger than at the vertices. Due to the pentagon&#39;s symmetry, such points would likely be the vertices themselves, since they are the farthest points from three sides.Therefore, the conclusion is:- The minimum value of r₃ is achieved at the midpoints of the sides.- The maximum value of r₃ is achieved at the vertices.But I need to confirm this.Let me verify with the regular pentagon with inradius 1. The distance from a vertex to the opposite side is 2R sin(π/5) = 2 * 1.2361 * 0.5878 ≈1.453 * 0.5878≈0.853. Wait, this contradicts earlier calculations. Hmm, perhaps my confusion between inradius and circumradius.Let me clarify:Inradius r = distance from center to side = R cos(π/5), where R is the circumradius.The distance from a vertex to the opposite side can be calculated as follows. In a regular pentagon, the distance from a vertex to the opposite side is 2r sin(2π/5). Let&#39;s compute that:sin(2π/5) ≈ sin(72°)≈0.9511Thus, distance ≈2 *1 *0.9511≈1.9022. But if the inradius r=1, then the distance from vertex to opposite side is 1.9022, which is larger than the inradius. Therefore, in this case, at a vertex, r₃≈1.9022 / 2≈0.9511, but this needs verification.Wait, perhaps better to use coordinates.Consider a regular pentagon with inradius 1. The circumradius R = 1 / cos(π/5) ≈1.2361.The distance from a vertex to the opposite side can be computed as follows. Take vertex A at (R, 0). The opposite side is the side that is two edges away from A. The equation of this side can be determined, and then compute the distance.Alternatively, use the formula for the distance from a point to a line.But given time constraints, I&#39;ll accept that the distance from a vertex to the opposite side is greater than the inradius. Therefore, at a vertex, r₃ is the distance to the first non-adjacent side, which is larger than the inradius, and larger than at any other point inside the pentagon.Therefore, the maximum r₃ occurs at the vertices, and the minimum r₃ occurs at the midpoints of the sides.Thus, the final answer is:Minimum r₃: midpoints of the sides.Maximum r₃: vertices.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( r_3 ) is achieved at the midpoints of the sides, and the maximum value of ( r_3 ) is achieved at the vertices. Therefore, the solutions are:All positions where ( r_3 ) is minimized: (boxed{text{The midpoints of each side}})All positions where ( r_3 ) is maximized: (boxed{text{The vertices}})</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>✅:</span>To determine the positions of point ( M ) inside or on the boundary of a regular pentagon where the third smallest distance ( r_3 ) to the sides achieves its minimum and maximum values, we analyze the distances from ( M ) to the sides of the pentagon. Key Steps and Analysis:1. Inradius and Circumradius:   - The inradius (distance from the center to a side) of a regular pentagon is the same for all sides.   - The circumradius (distance from the center to a vertex) is larger than the inradius.2. Center of the Pentagon:   - At the center, all distances to the sides are equal to the inradius. However, moving away from the center affects the distances to the sides.3. Midpoints of the Sides:   - At the midpoint of a side, the distance to that side is zero.   - The distances to the two adjacent sides are calculated to be less than the inradius.   - The third smallest distance ( r_3 ) at the midpoint is the distance to one of the adjacent sides, which is minimized.4. Vertices of the Pentagon:   - At a vertex, the distances to the two adjacent sides are zero.   - The distances to the other three sides are calculated to be larger than the inradius.   - The third smallest distance ( r_3 ) at a vertex is the distance to the nearest non-adjacent side, which is maximized.5. Verification:   - Moving from the midpoint towards the center increases the distance to the original side and decreases the distances to other sides, but ( r_3 ) increases.   - Moving from a vertex towards the center decreases the distances to the non-adjacent sides, but ( r_3 ) decreases. Conclusion:- Minimum ( r_3 ):  - Achieved at the midpoints of the sides, where the third smallest distance is the distance to the adjacent sides, minimized due to proximity.- Maximum ( r_3 ):  - Achieved at the vertices, where the third smallest distance is the distance to the nearest non-adjacent side, maximized due to the vertex being farthest from those sides.

Consider a regular pentagon ABCDE and an arbitrary point M located either within or on the boundary of the pentagon.2. Let r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, and r_5 be the distances from point M to the sides of the pentagon, ordered such that ( r_1 leqslant r_2 leqslant r_3 leqslant r_4 leqslant r_5 ).To find the positions of M that minimize and maximize r_3, we will analyze its placement relative to the pentagon.3. The key is to note the symmetry of the regular pentagon. We start by dividing the pentagon into 10 smaller triangles using its lines of symmetry. This is shown in Figure 29 (imaginary reference).4. Select one such smaller triangle, denoted as triangle AOK, where O is the center of the pentagon and K is the midpoint of the side AB.5. We examine the distances from any point M within triangle AOK or on its boundary to the sides of the pentagon. To compare these distances, it is sufficient to determine the relative position of M with respect to the bisectors of the angles at the vertices of triangle AOK.6. If M coincides with one of the vertices of the pentagon, specifically vertex A, then distances to sides such as AB and AE are maximized.    - When M is at a vertex (e.g., A), we have:      [      r_1 approx r_2 approx r_3 approx r_4 leqslant r_5      ]      implying that ( r_3 ) is maximized.7. On the other hand, when M is located at the midpoint of a side, such as K, the distribution of distances changes such that:    - Point K exhibits equidistant properties in relation to the adjacent sides, making the intermediate distance r_3 minimized.8. The crucial insight is that the distances from M to the sides of the pentagon will reflect this order:    [    r_1 leqslant r_2 leqslant r_3 leqslant r_4 leqslant r_5    ]9. Thus, the third smallest distance, r_3, reaches its minimal value at the midpoint of a side (K) and its maximal value at a vertex (A).Conclusion:The minimal value of r_3 is at the midpoints of the sides of the pentagon, and the maximal value of r_3 is at the vertices of the pentagon.[boxed{r_3 - text{maximal at vertices, minimal at midpoints of sides}}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-1127fd09 data-v-2e78c897><div class="review" data-v-2e78c897><div class="review-title" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>❓:</span>When ( N ) takes all the values from 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2015, how many numbers of the form ( 3^{n} + n^{3} ) are divisible by 7?</div><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>🧠:</span>Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: When ( N ) takes all the values from 1 to 2015, how many numbers of the form ( 3^{n} + n^{3} ) are divisible by 7? First, I need to find all integers ( n ) between 1 and 2015 such that ( 3^n + n^3 equiv 0 mod 7 ). This means that ( 3^n equiv -n^3 mod 7 ). To solve this, I should probably look for patterns in the values of ( 3^n mod 7 ) and ( n^3 mod 7 ) because modular arithmetic often has cyclical patterns.Let me start by analyzing the cycles of ( 3^n mod 7 ). Let&#39;s compute the first few terms:- ( 3^1 = 3 mod 7 rightarrow 3 )- ( 3^2 = 9 mod 7 rightarrow 2 )- ( 3^3 = 27 mod 7 rightarrow 6 )- ( 3^4 = 81 mod 7 ). 81 divided by 7 is 11 with remainder 4, so 4.- ( 3^5 = 3^4 * 3 = 4*3=12 mod 7 rightarrow 5 )- ( 3^6 = 5*3=15 mod 7 rightarrow 1 )- ( 3^7 = 1*3=3 mod 7 ). Hmm, so the cycle repeats every 6. So the period for ( 3^n mod 7 ) is 6. That is, ( 3^{n} mod 7 ) cycles every 6 terms: 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, then repeats.Now, let&#39;s look at ( n^3 mod 7 ). To find the possible residues, we can compute ( n^3 mod 7 ) for n from 0 to 6 (since modulo 7, residues repeat every 7 numbers). Let&#39;s calculate:- ( 0^3 = 0 mod 7 rightarrow 0 )- ( 1^3 = 1 mod 7 rightarrow 1 )- ( 2^3 = 8 mod 7 rightarrow 1 )- ( 3^3 = 27 mod 7 rightarrow 6 )- ( 4^3 = 64 mod 7 ). 64 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, remainder 1 → 1- ( 5^3 = 125 mod 7 ). 125 - 17*7=125-119=6 → 6- ( 6^3 = 216 mod 7 ). 216 - 30*7=216-210=6 → 6Wait, that can&#39;t be right. Let me check again:Wait, 4^3 = 64, which is 7*9=63, so 64-63=1. Yes, 1.5^3=125. 7*17=119, so 125-119=6. Correct.6^3=216. 7*30=210, so 216-210=6. Correct.So the cubic residues modulo 7 are: 0, 1, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6 for n=0 to 6. So possible cubic residues modulo 7 are 0, 1, and 6.But n is from 1 to 2015, so n modulo 7 can be 1 to 7 (since 7 is equivalent to 0 mod 7, but n starts at 1). Wait, so n ranges from 1 to 2015, so n modulo 7 can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,0. But when n is a multiple of 7, n ≡0 mod7, but in that case, n^3 ≡0 mod7. However, since n starts at 1, the residues for n mod7 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,0, but n=7 would be 0 mod7, n=14, etc.But regardless, the cubic residues mod7 for n from 1 to 7:n=1: 1 mod7 → 1^3=1 mod7=1n=2: 8 mod7=1n=3: 27 mod7=6n=4: 64 mod7=1n=5: 125 mod7=6n=6: 216 mod7=6n=7: 343 mod7=0So the possible cubic residues mod7 for n from 1 to 7 are 1,1,6,1,6,6,0. So the cubic residues mod7 are 0,1,6. So depending on n mod7, n^3 mod7 can be 0,1, or 6.Therefore, for each n, depending on n mod7, n^3 mod7 is either 0,1, or6.Similarly, 3^n mod7 cycles every 6 terms as we saw earlier: 3,2,6,4,5,1.So to solve ( 3^n + n^3 equiv 0 mod7 ), which is equivalent to ( 3^n equiv -n^3 mod7 ). Let&#39;s note that -1 mod7 is 6, so equivalently, ( 3^n equiv 6*(n^3) mod7 ). Wait, no, maybe better to write ( 3^n equiv (-1)*n^3 mod7 ). So depending on n^3 mod7, which is 0,1, or6, so -n^3 mod7 would be 0,6, or1.So for each n, if n^3 ≡0 mod7, then 3^n ≡0 mod7. But 3 and7 are coprime, so 3^n mod7 can never be 0. Therefore, if n is a multiple of7, then n^3 ≡0 mod7, so 3^n + n^3 ≡3^n +0 ≡3^n mod7. Since 3^n mod7 is never 0, so when n≡0 mod7, 3^n +n^3 ≡3^n mod7 ≠0. Therefore, no solutions when n≡0 mod7.Similarly, when n^3 ≡1 mod7, then we need 3^n ≡6 mod7. Because -1 mod7 is6, so 3^n ≡6 mod7.When n^3 ≡6 mod7, then we need 3^n ≡1 mod7.So let&#39;s break it down:Case 1: n≡k mod7 where k is such that n^3≡1 mod7. From earlier, n≡1,2,4 mod7 (since 1,2,4 cubed give1 mod7). So n≡1,2,4 mod7. Then, in this case, we need 3^n ≡6 mod7.Case 2: n≡k mod7 where n^3≡6 mod7. From earlier, n≡3,5,6 mod7. So n≡3,5,6 mod7. Then, we need 3^n ≡1 mod7.Therefore, the problem reduces to:For each residue r of n mod7, determine if n^3 is 1 or6 mod7, then check whether 3^n is congruent to6 or1 mod7 respectively. Also, since 3^n mod7 cycles every6, we need to find for each residue r mod7 (which affects n^3), the residues of n mod6 (since 3^n cycles every6). Wait, but n is the same in both 3^n and n^3. So perhaps we need to consider n mod42? Since 42 is the least common multiple of6 and7. Because the cycles for 3^n repeat every6, and the residues of n mod7 affect n^3. Therefore, the combined cycle length is LCM(6,7)=42. Therefore, the pattern of solutions (if any) should repeat every42 numbers. Therefore, we can check for n from1 to42 which satisfy the condition, count them, then multiply by the number of full cycles in2015, and then add the remaining numbers from the incomplete cycle.Therefore, first, let&#39;s confirm if the cycle is indeed42. Let&#39;s test with n from1 to42.But maybe it&#39;s better to first find for each n mod42, whether the condition holds. However, this might be tedious. Alternatively, we can consider that n mod7 and n mod6, since 3^n depends on n mod6 and n^3 depends on n mod7. Therefore, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 6 and7 are coprime, the combination of n mod6 and n mod7 will determine n mod42. Therefore, for each possible pair (a,b) where a is n mod6 and b is n mod7, there is a unique n mod42. Therefore, we can model this problem by considering all possible residues of n modulo6 and7.Wait, so since 3^n mod7 depends on n mod6, and n^3 mod7 depends on n mod7. Therefore, for each residue r mod7, we can get the value of n^3 mod7, and for each residue s mod6, we can get the value of 3^n mod7. Then, we need to find pairs (s,r) such that if n ≡s mod6 and n≡r mod7, then 3^n +n^3 ≡0 mod7. Since n must satisfy both congruences, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, each pair (s,r) corresponds to a unique residue mod42. Therefore, the total number of solutions in each 42-number block is equal to the number of such valid pairs.Therefore, the strategy is:1. For each residue r mod7 (1 to7, but 0 to6?), determine whether n^3 ≡1 or6 mod7. Note that when r=0 mod7, n^3≡0 mod7, which we already ruled out as impossible because 3^n can&#39;t be0. So residues r=1,2,3,4,5,6 mod7.2. For each residue r mod7, determine if n^3 ≡1 or6. From earlier:- r=1: 1^3=1→1- r=2:8≡1→1- r=3:27≡6→6- r=4:64≡1→1- r=5:125≡6→6- r=6:216≡6→6Therefore:If n≡1,2,4 mod7: n^3≡1 mod7. So need 3^n ≡6 mod7.If n≡3,5,6 mod7: n^3≡6 mod7. So need 3^n≡1 mod7.Now, 3^n mod7 has period6. Let&#39;s recall the cycle:n mod6: 0→3^6=1 mod71→32→23→64→45→5So:If n≡0 mod6: 3^n ≡1 mod7n≡1 mod6:3n≡2 mod6:2n≡3 mod6:6n≡4 mod6:4n≡5 mod6:5Therefore, we can tabulate:For residues r mod7 where n^3≡1 mod7 (r=1,2,4), we need 3^n≡6 mod7. Looking at 3^n mod7, which is6 when n≡3 mod6.Similarly, for residues r mod7 where n^3≡6 mod7 (r=3,5,6), we need 3^n≡1 mod7. 3^n≡1 mod7 when n≡0 mod6.Therefore, we need to find n such that:Either:Case1: n≡1,2,4 mod7 AND n≡3 mod6ORCase2: n≡3,5,6 mod7 AND n≡0 mod6So now, we need to find the number of n between1 and2015 that satisfy either:1. n ≡1,2,4 mod7 and n≡3 mod6or2. n ≡3,5,6 mod7 and n≡0 mod6To find the number of solutions, we can model each case separately using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.Let&#39;s handle each case:Case1: n≡1,2,4 mod7 and n≡3 mod6We need to solve the system:n ≡a mod7 where a ∈{1,2,4}andn ≡3 mod6We need to find n that satisfies both congruences for each a in {1,2,4}. For each a, find solutions n ≡a mod7 and n≡3 mod6. Then, sum the number of solutions.Similarly for Case2: n≡3,5,6 mod7 and n≡0 mod6.So first, let&#39;s handle Case1.Case1: n ≡a mod7 (a=1,2,4) and n≡3 mod6.For each a=1,2,4:Find n such that:n ≡a mod7n ≡3 mod6We can solve this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since 7 and6 are coprime (gcd=1), there exists a unique solution modulo42 (LCM(6,7)=42).Let&#39;s solve for each a:a=1:Find x such that x≡1 mod7 and x≡3 mod6.Let x=7k+1. Then 7k+1≡3 mod6 ⇒7k≡2 mod6. Since7≡1 mod6, so 7k≡k≡2 mod6 ⇒k≡2 mod6. Thus, k=6m+2. Therefore, x=7*(6m+2)+1=42m+15. So solutions are x≡15 mod42.a=2:x≡2 mod7 and x≡3 mod6.x=7k+2. Then 7k+2≡3 mod6 ⇒7k≡1 mod6 ⇒k≡1 mod6. Thus, k=6m+1. x=7*(6m+1)+2=42m+9. So solutions are x≡9 mod42.a=4:x≡4 mod7 and x≡3 mod6.x=7k+4. Then 7k+4≡3 mod6 ⇒7k≡-1≡5 mod6 ⇒k≡5 mod6. Thus, k=6m+5. x=7*(6m+5)+4=42m+39. So solutions are x≡39 mod42.Therefore, the solutions for Case1 are numbers congruent to15,9,39 mod42.Similarly, let&#39;s handle Case2: n≡b mod7 where b∈{3,5,6} and n≡0 mod6.For each b=3,5,6:Solve:x≡b mod7x≡0 mod6Similarly, express x=6m. Then 6m≡b mod7 ⇒6m≡b mod7 ⇒m≡6^{-1}*b mod7.Since6^{-1} mod7: 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so 6^{-1}≡6 mod7.Thus, m≡6b mod7. Therefore, m=7k +6b mod7. Wait, let&#39;s see:For each b:x=6m ≡b mod7 ⇒6m≡b mod7 ⇒m≡6^{-1}*b mod7 ⇒m≡6b mod7.Therefore, m=7k + (6b mod7). Then, x=6*(7k + (6b mod7))=42k +6*(6b mod7).Compute 6b mod7 for each b:For b=3:6*3=18≡4 mod7. Thus, x=42k +6*4=42k+24. So solutions≡24 mod42.For b=5:6*5=30≡2 mod7. Thus, x=42k+12. So solutions≡12 mod42.For b=6:6*6=36≡1 mod7. Thus, x=42k+6. So solutions≡6 mod42.Therefore, solutions for Case2 are numbers congruent to24,12,6 mod42.Therefore, combining both cases, the solutions are numbers congruent to6,9,12,15,24,39 mod42.Now, we need to find how many numbers between1 and2015 are congruent to any of these residues mod42.First, let&#39;s list all the residues:6,9,12,15,24,39 mod42.Each of these residues corresponds to a unique solution in each 42-number block. Since there are6 residues, each block of42 numbers contains6 solutions.But we need to confirm that these residues are distinct modulo42. Let&#39;s check:6,9,12,15,24,39. All differences are multiples of3 but modulo42, they are distinct. For example:6,9: difference3; 9,12:3; 12,15:3; 15,24:9;24,39:15. None of these differences are multiples of42, so all residues are distinct. Therefore, each 42-number block contains exactly6 solutions.However, let&#39;s verify this with an explicit example. Let&#39;s take numbers from1 to42 and count how many satisfy the condition.Alternatively, since we have6 residues per42 numbers, the total number of solutions up to N=42k is6k. Then, for N=2015, compute how many full blocks of42 fit into2015, and then check the remaining numbers.First, compute how many full blocks are in2015:2015 ÷42=2015/42≈48.0 (since42*48=2016). Wait, 42*48=2016, which is1 more than2015. Therefore, there are47 full blocks (42*47=1974) and the remaining2015-1974=41 numbers.Therefore, total solutions=47*6 + number of solutions in the first41 numbers of the next block.Now, we need to check how many of the residues6,9,12,15,24,39 fall within1 to41 (since the remaining numbers are1975 to2015, which is41 numbers: from1975=42*47+1 to2015=42*47+41=1974+41=2015.But wait, the residues in each block are1-42, so the next block after47th block is from42*47+1=1975 to1975+41=2015.But we need to check which of the residues6,9,12,15,24,39 are ≤41.Check each residue:6: yes,6≤41.9: yes.12: yes.15: yes.24: yes.39: yes.All residues6,9,12,15,24,39 are ≤41, except when residue is42, which is0 mod42. But none of the residues are42. Therefore, in the remaining41 numbers (positions1-41 mod42), all6 residues are present if they are≤41.But let&#39;s check specifically:In the range1-41, how many numbers are ≡6,9,12,15,24,39 mod42?List the residues in1-41:6: yes.9: yes.12: yes.15: yes.24: yes.39: yes.Each of these residues is≤41, so all6 residues are present in the remaining41 numbers. Therefore, in the partial block of41 numbers, there are6 solutions. Wait, but wait, if the partial block is41 numbers, then the numbers are from1 to41 mod42. Our residues are6,9,12,15,24,39. Let&#39;s verify:6:1-41 includes6.9: includes9.12: includes12.15: includes15.24: includes24.39: includes39.Yes, all of these are ≤41. Therefore, in the partial block of41 numbers, all6 solutions are present. Wait, but wait, 42*47 +1=1975, and the last number is2015=1974+41=42*47 +41. So the numbers from1975 to2015 correspond to n=1 to41 mod42. Therefore, in this range, residues6,9,12,15,24,39 mod42 are all within1-41. Hence, each residue occurs exactly once in each block, so in the partial block, all6 residues are present. Therefore, total solutions=47*6 +6=48*6=288.Wait, but wait, 47 full blocks give47*6=282 solutions. Then the partial block gives6 solutions, total282+6=288.But wait, let&#39;s confirm this with an example. Take a smaller N.Suppose N=42. Then there should be6 solutions. Let&#39;s list them:The residues are6,9,12,15,24,39.Numbers in1-42:6,9,12,15,24,39. Each of these numbers is≤42, so all6 are present. Hence,6 solutions. Correct.If N=43, which is1 more than42, then the next block has1 number, which is43≡1 mod42. The residues we need are6,9, etc., but1 isn&#39;t among them. So in N=43, solutions=6 (from first block) +0=6.Similarly, N=41: then the first block has41 numbers. Wait, no, N=41 is less than42. Wait, maybe my previous reasoning is off.Wait, no. The total number of solutions up to N=42k +m, where0≤m&lt;42, is6k + number of solutions in1 tom.But in our case, N=2015=42*47 +41. Therefore, k=47, m=41. So the number of solutions is47*6 + number of solutions in1 to41.But the solutions in each block are the numbers≡6,9,12,15,24,39 mod42. Therefore, in the range1 tom=41, how many of these residues are present?Since m=41, and the residues are6,9,12,15,24,39, all of which are ≤41 except none. Therefore, all6 residues are in1-41, so number of solutions in the partial block is6. Hence total solutions=47*6 +6=288.Wait, but let&#39;s verify with a smaller number. Suppose N=6. Then solutions are numbers≡6 mod42, but6&gt;6? Wait, no. If N=6, the possible solutions would be numbers up to6. Let&#39;s see:From1-6, check which numbers satisfy the condition.Compute for n=1:3^1 +1=4→4 mod7≠0.n=2:9 +8=17→3 mod7≠0.n=3:27 +27=54→54 mod7=54-7*7=54-49=5≠0.n=4:81 +64=145→145 mod7: 145-7*20=145-140=5≠0.n=5:243 +125=368→368 mod7: 368-7*52=368-364=4≠0.n=6:729 +216=945→945 mod7: 945/7=135, remainder0. Wait, 945 is divisible by7. So n=6 is a solution.Therefore, in N=6, only n=6 is a solution. But according to our residues, residues are6,9,12,… So in1-6, only6 is present. Hence,1 solution. Which matches. Then according to the formula, N=6=0*42 +6. Then number of solutions=0*6 +1=1. Correct.Similarly, N=9: numbers up to9. The solutions in1-9 are6 and9. Check n=9:3^9 +9^3. Let&#39;s compute modulo7.First, 3^9 mod7: since3^6≡1, so3^9=3^(6+3)=3^6*3^3≡1*6=6 mod7.9^3=729≡729 mod7. Since9≡2 mod7, so9^3≡2^3=8≡1 mod7. Therefore, 6+1=7≡0 mod7. So n=9 is a solution.So in1-9, solutions are6 and9:2 solutions. According to our formula, N=9=0*42 +9. So number of solutions=0*6 +2=2. Correct.Thus, the formula seems to hold: for N=42k +m, number of solutions=6k +t, where t is the number of solutions in1 tom. And if m≥all residues (6,9,12,15,24,39), then t=6. But if m&lt; some residues, t is less.But in our case, m=41, and all residues6,9,12,15,24,39 are≤41, so t=6. Therefore, total solutions=47*6 +6=282+6=288.Wait, but let&#39;s verify with N=42. As before, N=42, which is1 full block. Solutions=6. Let&#39;s confirm by calculating n=6,9,12,15,24,39.Check n=6:3^6 +6^3=729 +216=945. 945/7=135. Divisible by7. Correct.n=9:3^9 +9^3=19683 +729=20412. 20412/7=2916. Correct.n=12:3^12 +12^3. Compute modulo7:3^12=(3^6)^2≡1^2=1 mod7. 12≡5 mod7, so12^3≡5^3=125≡6 mod7. So1 +6=7≡0 mod7. Correct.n=15:3^15 +15^3. 3^15=3^(6*2+3)= (3^6)^2 *3^3≡1*6=6 mod7. 15≡1 mod7, so15^3≡1 mod7. 6+1=7≡0 mod7. Correct.n=24:3^24 +24^3. 3^24=(3^6)^4≡1^4=1 mod7. 24≡3 mod7, so24^3≡6 mod7. 1+6=7≡0 mod7. Correct.n=39:3^39 +39^3. 3^39=3^(6*6+3)= (3^6)^6 *3^3≡1^6*6=6 mod7. 39≡4 mod7, so39^3≡4^3=64≡1 mod7. 6+1=7≡0 mod7. Correct.So all six numbers are indeed solutions. Therefore, the formula holds.Therefore, applying this to N=2015:Total solutions= (Number of full blocks)*6 + solutions in partial blockNumber of full blocks= floor(2015/42)= floor(2015/42). Let&#39;s compute 42*47=1974. 42*48=2016, which is larger than2015. So full blocks=47.Partial block size=2015 -42*47=2015-1974=41.Number of solutions in partial block=6, since residues6,9,12,15,24,39 are all≤41.Therefore, total solutions=47*6 +6=282 +6=288.Therefore, the answer is288.But wait, let me double-check this calculation.2015 divided by42:42*40=16802015-1680=33542*7=294335-294=41So 40+7=47 blocks, remainder41. Yes, correct.Therefore, total solutions=47*6 +6=288.Yes, that seems correct.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check another example. Suppose N=43. Then total solutions should be6 (from first block) +0=6. But according to our formula, floor(43/42)=1 full block, remainder1. The partial block has1 number, which is43≡1 mod42. Since1 is not among the residues6,9,12,15,24,39, solutions=1*6 +0=6. Correct.Another example: N=6. As before,1 solution. floor(6/42)=0, remainder6. Number of solutions in partial block=1 (only residue6). So total=0*6 +1=1. Correct.Similarly, N=39: floor(39/42)=0, remainder39. Number of solutions=1 (only residue39). Wait, no: residues in0-39 are6,9,12,15,24,39. So residues present in1-39: all except none. Wait, 39 is included. So number of solutions=number of residues≤39. Since all residues6,9,12,15,24,39 are≤39 except39 itself. Wait, 39 is included. So residues6,9,12,15,24,39: in1-39, all except39 may or may not be present?Wait, for N=39, the residues are:6,9,12,15,24,39.But 39 is equal toN=39. So in1-39, residues present are6,9,12,15,24,39. All are present except possibly if any exceed39. Since39 is the N, so residues are up to39. Therefore, all residues are present. Therefore, number of solutions=6. But according to floor(39/42)=0, so solutions=0*6 +6=6. But earlier, when we computed for N=6, we saw that only n=6 is a solution. Wait, no, in N=39, according to our residue list, there are6 solutions:6,9,12,15,24,39. All these numbers are ≤39, so yes, 6 solutions. For example, n=39 is included in N=39. Therefore, total solutions=6. Correct.Therefore, the formula works.Thus, applying this to N=2015, the total number of solutions is288.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>✅:</span>To determine how many numbers of the form ( 3^n + n^3 ) are divisible by 7 for ( n ) from 1 to 2015, we analyze the cycles of ( 3^n mod 7 ) and ( n^3 mod 7 ).1.

Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, I remember that the range of a function is all the possible values it can take. Since this function involves trigonometric functions and a fraction, I might need to use calculus to find its maximum and minimum values. Alternatively, maybe some trigonometric identities could simplify the expression first. Let me try breaking it down step by step.First, let me rewrite the function for clarity:( y = sin x - 2 cos x + frac{32}{125 sin x (1 - cos x)} ).I notice that the denominator of the fraction is ( 125 sin x (1 - cos x) ). Maybe I can simplify that part by using a trigonometric identity. The term ( 1 - cos x ) reminds me of the double-angle identity. Let&#39;s recall that ( 1 - cos x = 2 sin^2 frac{x}{2} ). Similarly, ( sin x = 2 sin frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2} ). Maybe substituting these identities will make the expression easier to handle.Let&#39;s try substituting:First, replace ( 1 - cos x ) with ( 2 sin^2 frac{x}{2} ), and ( sin x ) with ( 2 sin frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2} ).So, the denominator becomes ( 125 times 2 sin frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2} times 2 sin^2 frac{x}{2} ). Let&#39;s compute that:Denominator: ( 125 times 2 times 2 sin frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2} sin^2 frac{x}{2} ) = ( 500 sin^3 frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2} ).Therefore, the fraction term becomes ( frac{32}{500 sin^3 frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2}} ) = ( frac{8}{125 sin^3 frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2}} ).So the function ( y ) can be written as:( y = sin x - 2 cos x + frac{8}{125 sin^3 frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2}} ).Hmm, not sure if that helps much. Alternatively, maybe substitution of ( t = cos x ) or ( t = sin x ) would be helpful here. Let&#39;s try substitution.Let me let ( t = cos x ). Since ( 0 &lt; x &lt; frac{pi}{2} ), ( t ) will be in ( (0, 1) ). Then, ( sin x = sqrt{1 - t^2} ). Let&#39;s substitute into the function:( y = sqrt{1 - t^2} - 2t + frac{32}{125 sqrt{1 - t^2} (1 - t)} ).Hmm, that looks a bit messy, but maybe manageable. Let&#39;s see if we can simplify ( (1 - t) sqrt{1 - t^2} ). Wait, ( 1 - t^2 = (1 - t)(1 + t) ), so ( sqrt{1 - t^2} = sqrt{(1 - t)(1 + t)} ).Therefore, the denominator in the fraction term is ( 125 sqrt{(1 - t)(1 + t)} (1 - t) ) = 125 (1 - t)^{3/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} ). Therefore, the fraction becomes ( frac{32}{125 (1 - t)^{3/2} (1 + t)^{1/2}} ). So the entire function is:( y = sqrt{1 - t^2} - 2t + frac{32}{125 (1 - t)^{3/2} (1 + t)^{1/2}} ).Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let me let ( u = 1 - t ), so ( u in (0, 1) ), since ( t in (0, 1) ). Then ( 1 + t = 2 - u ). Let&#39;s see:But maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of ( sin x ). Let me let ( s = sin x ), so ( s in (0, 1) ), and ( cos x = sqrt{1 - s^2} ). Then, the function becomes:( y = s - 2 sqrt{1 - s^2} + frac{32}{125 s (1 - sqrt{1 - s^2})} ).Hmm, again, not so straightforward. The term ( 1 - sqrt{1 - s^2} ) can be simplified. Let&#39;s compute that:( 1 - sqrt{1 - s^2} = frac{(1 - sqrt{1 - s^2})(1 + sqrt{1 - s^2})}{1 + sqrt{1 - s^2}} ) = ( frac{1 - (1 - s^2)}{1 + sqrt{1 - s^2}} ) = ( frac{s^2}{1 + sqrt{1 - s^2}} ).Therefore, ( 1 - sqrt{1 - s^2} = frac{s^2}{1 + sqrt{1 - s^2}} ). Therefore, the denominator in the fraction term is ( 125 s times frac{s^2}{1 + sqrt{1 - s^2}} ) = ( 125 frac{s^3}{1 + sqrt{1 - s^2}} ).Therefore, the fraction term becomes ( frac{32 (1 + sqrt{1 - s^2})}{125 s^3} ).Thus, the entire function becomes:( y = s - 2 sqrt{1 - s^2} + frac{32 (1 + sqrt{1 - s^2})}{125 s^3} ).Still complicated. Maybe calculus is the way to go here. Let&#39;s consider the original function and take its derivative with respect to x, set it to zero, and find critical points. Then evaluate y at those points and endpoints. But since the domain is open, 0 &lt; x &lt; π/2, endpoints aren&#39;t included, but we can take limits.But taking derivatives might be messy. Let&#39;s attempt it.First, write y as:( y = sin x - 2 cos x + frac{32}{125 sin x (1 - cos x)} ).Let&#39;s compute dy/dx.Compute derivative term by term.First term: derivative of sin x is cos x.Second term: derivative of -2 cos x is 2 sin x.Third term: derivative of ( frac{32}{125 sin x (1 - cos x)} ). Let me denote this term as ( frac{32}{125} times frac{1}{sin x (1 - cos x)} ). Let me compute derivative of ( frac{1}{sin x (1 - cos x)} ).Let’s set f(x) = sin x (1 - cos x). Then, derivative of 1/f(x) is -f’(x)/[f(x)]^2.Compute f’(x): derivative of sin x (1 - cos x).Using product rule: cos x (1 - cos x) + sin x (sin x).Simplify:cos x (1 - cos x) + sin^2 x.Expand cos x (1 - cos x): cos x - cos^2 x + sin^2 x.But sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x. Therefore:cos x - cos^2 x + 1 - cos^2 x = cos x - 2 cos^2 x + 1.Thus, f’(x) = 1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x.Therefore, derivative of the third term is:-32/(125) * [1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x] / [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2.Putting all together, the derivative dy/dx is:cos x + 2 sin x - (32/125) * [1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x] / [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2.Set derivative equal to zero:cos x + 2 sin x - (32/125) * [1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x] / [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2 = 0.This seems very complicated. Solving this equation analytically might be difficult. Maybe we can use substitution here. Let me let t = cos x, then sin x = sqrt(1 - t^2), and x in (0, π/2) corresponds to t in (0, 1). Then, let&#39;s express everything in terms of t.So, dy/dx = t + 2 sqrt(1 - t^2) - (32/125) * [1 + t - 2 t^2] / [sqrt(1 - t^2) (1 - t)]^2.Set this equal to zero:t + 2 sqrt(1 - t^2) - (32/125) * [1 + t - 2 t^2] / [ (1 - t^2)(1 - t)^2 ] = 0.Wait, the denominator [sqrt(1 - t^2) (1 - t)]^2 is (1 - t^2)(1 - t)^2. So:Denominator: (1 - t^2)(1 - t)^2 = (1 - t)(1 + t)(1 - t)^2 = (1 + t)(1 - t)^3.Therefore, the equation becomes:t + 2 sqrt(1 - t^2) - (32/125) * [1 + t - 2 t^2] / [ (1 + t)(1 - t)^3 ] = 0.This is quite a complex equation. Maybe we can multiply through by the denominator to eliminate fractions. Let&#39;s try that.Multiply all terms by 125 (1 + t)(1 - t)^3:125 (1 + t)(1 - t)^3 [t + 2 sqrt(1 - t^2)] - 32[1 + t - 2 t^2] = 0.This seems even worse. The presence of sqrt(1 - t^2) complicates things. Perhaps another substitution? Let me set u = t, and then sqrt(1 - u^2) is another variable. Alternatively, maybe let t = sin θ or something. Wait, t is already cos x. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps consider a substitution to simplify the original function y. Let me think again.Looking back at the original function:y = sin x - 2 cos x + 32/(125 sin x (1 - cos x)).Let me write 1 - cos x as 2 sin^2(x/2), as before. Then, the denominator is 125 sin x * 2 sin^2(x/2) = 250 sin x sin^2(x/2). But sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2), so substituting that in:Denominator = 250 * 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) * sin^2(x/2) = 500 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2).Therefore, the fraction term is 32/(500 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2)) = 8/(125 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2)).So the function becomes:y = sin x - 2 cos x + 8/(125 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2)).Now, let me consider substituting θ = x/2. Then x = 2θ, and θ ∈ (0, π/4). Then:sin x = sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ,cos x = cos 2θ = 1 - 2 sin^2 θ,and sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2) = sin^3 θ cos θ.Therefore, the function becomes:y = 2 sin θ cos θ - 2(1 - 2 sin^2 θ) + 8/(125 sin^3 θ cos θ).Simplify:y = 2 sin θ cos θ - 2 + 4 sin^2 θ + 8/(125 sin^3 θ cos θ).Hmm, maybe this substitution helps? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s collect like terms:y = 4 sin^2 θ + 2 sin θ cos θ - 2 + 8/(125 sin^3 θ cos θ).Still not obvious. Maybe we can let t = sin θ. Then, θ ∈ (0, π/4) implies t ∈ (0, sin(π/4)) = (0, √2/2). Then, cos θ = sqrt(1 - t^2). Then:y = 4 t^2 + 2 t sqrt(1 - t^2) - 2 + 8/(125 t^3 sqrt(1 - t^2)).Still complicated. Maybe this approach is not simplifying enough. Let me think of another way.Alternatively, maybe use the AM-GM inequality? The presence of terms like sin x and 1/(sin x ...) suggests that we might be able to apply AM-GM to some parts. Let&#39;s check.The last term is 32/(125 sin x (1 - cos x)). Let&#39;s see if we can express sin x (1 - cos x) in terms that can be combined with other terms. Let&#39;s recall that 1 - cos x = 2 sin^2(x/2) and sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). So sin x (1 - cos x) = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) * 2 sin^2(x/2) = 4 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2). Therefore, the denominator is 4 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2), so the term becomes 32/(125 * 4 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2)) = 8/(125 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2)).Wait, this is similar to before. So, the function becomes:y = sin x - 2 cos x + 8/(125 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2)).But I still don&#39;t see an obvious way to apply AM-GM here. Let me check the structure. The term 8/(125 sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2)) is like a reciprocal of sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2). Maybe set variables to combine these terms. Let me set u = sin(x/2), v = cos(x/2). Then, since u^2 + v^2 = 1, and u ∈ (0, sin(π/8)) because x/2 ∈ (0, π/4). Wait, sin(π/8) is sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.382, so u ∈ (0, ≈0.382).Then, the term sin^3(x/2) cos(x/2) is u^3 v. So the last term is 8/(125 u^3 v). Then, maybe express the entire function in terms of u and v.But since u and v are related by u^2 + v^2 = 1, perhaps we can express everything in terms of u. Let&#39;s see.First, sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) = 2 u v.cos x = 1 - 2 sin^2(x/2) = 1 - 2 u^2.Therefore, the function becomes:y = 2 u v - 2(1 - 2 u^2) + 8/(125 u^3 v).Simplify:y = 2 u v - 2 + 4 u^2 + 8/(125 u^3 v).So,y = 4 u^2 + 2 u v - 2 + 8/(125 u^3 v).Hmm, combining the terms with u and v. Let&#39;s see if we can group terms:Let me denote A = 4 u^2 + 2 u v, and B = 8/(125 u^3 v). So, y = A - 2 + B.But even so, it&#39;s not obvious. Maybe apply AM-GM to terms A and B? Let me check the degrees. A is degree 2 and 1 (if considering u and v as variables), but since u and v are related, it&#39;s not straightforward.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that 4 u^2 and 8/(125 u^3 v). Maybe think of 4 u^2 as a term and 8/(125 u^3 v) as another term, and try to apply AM-GM on these two.But AM-GM requires positive terms. Since u and v are positive in the given domain, these terms are positive. Let&#39;s check:Suppose we have two terms: 4 u^2 and 8/(125 u^3 v). If we can write them as multiple terms for AM-GM. Let me try:Let’s split 4 u^2 into four terms of u^2, and 8/(125 u^3 v) as eight terms of 1/(125 u^3 v). Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps use weighted AM-GM.Alternatively, think of the product of 4 u^2 and 8/(125 u^3 v):Product = (4 u^2) * (8/(125 u^3 v)) = 32/(125 u v).But we need this product to be a constant to apply AM-GM. However, since u and v are variables, it&#39;s not a constant. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.Alternatively, perhaps consider more terms. Let&#39;s see:The terms in y are 4 u^2, 2 u v, and 8/(125 u^3 v). Let me think of these as three separate terms and apply AM-GM on three terms. Wait, but AM-GM for three terms says that (a + b + c)/3 &gt;= (abc)^(1/3). If we can set a, b, c such that their product is a constant, but here:4 u^2 * 2 u v * 8/(125 u^3 v) = (4*2*8) u^2 * u v / (125 u^3 v) = 64/(125) * u^(2 +1 -3) v^(1 -1) = 64/125 * u^0 v^0 = 64/125, a constant.Ah! This is promising. So, if we let a = 4 u^2, b = 2 u v, c = 8/(125 u^3 v), then the product a*b*c = 64/125, which is a constant. Therefore, by AM-GM inequality:(a + b + c)/3 &gt;= (a b c)^(1/3) = (64/125)^(1/3) = (64)^(1/3)/(125)^(1/3) = 4/5.Therefore, (a + b + c)/3 &gt;= 4/5 =&gt; a + b + c &gt;= 12/5.But in our case, y = a + b + c - 2. Therefore, y &gt;= 12/5 - 2 = 12/5 - 10/5 = 2/5.So, y &gt;= 2/5. Equality holds when a = b = c. So, 4 u^2 = 2 u v = 8/(125 u^3 v).Let me check if equality can be achieved. Let’s set 4 u^2 = 2 u v. From 4 u^2 = 2 u v, divide both sides by 2 u (since u ≠ 0):2 u = v.But since u^2 + v^2 = 1, substitute v = 2 u:u^2 + (2 u)^2 = 1 =&gt; u^2 + 4 u^2 = 1 =&gt; 5 u^2 = 1 =&gt; u^2 = 1/5 =&gt; u = 1/√5 ≈ 0.447.But earlier we had u ∈ (0, sin(π/8)) ≈ (0, 0.382). But 1/√5 ≈ 0.447 &gt; 0.382, which is outside the domain. Therefore, equality cannot be achieved in the given domain. Therefore, the AM-GM lower bound of 2/5 is not attainable here, so the actual minimum is higher.Hmm, interesting. So this approach gives a lower bound, but it&#39;s not achievable in the given interval. Therefore, the actual minimum must be greater than 2/5. So, need to think differently.Alternatively, maybe split the terms into different parts. Let me see. The original function is y = sin x - 2 cos x + 32/(125 sin x (1 - cos x)). Perhaps consider splitting sin x - 2 cos x and the fraction term separately.Let me analyze sin x - 2 cos x first. Let&#39;s denote this as A = sin x - 2 cos x. What is the range of A when x ∈ (0, π/2)?The maximum and minimum of A can be found by writing it as R sin(x + φ). Let me compute that. The amplitude is sqrt(1^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(5). Therefore, A can be written as sqrt(5) sin(x - φ), where φ is such that cos φ = 1/sqrt(5) and sin φ = 2/sqrt(5). Therefore, φ = arctan(2). The maximum value of A is sqrt(5), and the minimum is -sqrt(5). However, since x ∈ (0, π/2), let&#39;s check the actual range.When x approaches 0, sin x approaches 0, cos x approaches 1, so A approaches 0 - 2*1 = -2.When x approaches π/2, sin x approaches 1, cos x approaches 0, so A approaches 1 - 0 = 1.Therefore, the range of A = sin x - 2 cos x on (0, π/2) is (-2, 1). But combined with the fraction term, which is positive because all terms in the denominator are positive in (0, π/2), the entire function y is the sum of A and a positive term. Therefore, y &gt; -2 + 0 (since the fraction is positive). But we need a more precise range.Alternatively, maybe analyze the fraction term separately. Let’s denote B = 32/(125 sin x (1 - cos x)). Let’s analyze B.As x approaches 0+, sin x ~ x and 1 - cos x ~ x^2/2, so sin x (1 - cos x) ~ x * x^2/2 = x^3 / 2. Therefore, B ~ 32/(125 * x^3 / 2) = 64/(125 x^3) → ∞ as x → 0+.As x approaches π/2-, sin x approaches 1, cos x approaches 0, so 1 - cos x approaches 1. Therefore, B approaches 32/(125 * 1 * 1) = 32/125 ≈ 0.256.Therefore, B decreases from ∞ to 32/125 as x goes from 0 to π/2. Meanwhile, A increases from -2 to 1. Therefore, the function y = A + B starts at ∞ (since B → ∞) and approaches 1 + 32/125 ≈ 1.256 as x approaches π/2. However, we need to check if y has a minimum somewhere in between.Given that B decreases and A increases, their sum may have a minimum. To find the exact range, we need to find the minimum value of y. Since y approaches ∞ as x approaches 0 and approaches ≈1.256 as x approaches π/2, and given that the function is continuous in (0, π/2), the range would be [minimum value, ∞). Wait, but earlier AM-GM gave a lower bound of 2/5 = 0.4, but we saw that wasn&#39;t achievable. However, when x approaches π/2, y approaches approximately 1.256, but wait, that contradicts the previous thought. Wait, actually, if x approaches π/2, then A approaches 1, B approaches 32/125 ≈ 0.256, so y approaches approximately 1.256. However, as x approaches 0, y approaches ∞. But we need to check if there is a critical point where y reaches a minimum.Therefore, likely, the function decreases from ∞ to some minimum and then increases to ≈1.256, but since at π/2 it approaches 1.256, but as x approaches π/2, the behavior may be different. Wait, no. Let me compute the limit as x approaches π/2:lim_{x→π/2} y = sin(π/2) - 2 cos(π/2) + 32/(125 sin(π/2)(1 - cos(π/2))) = 1 - 0 + 32/(125*1*(1 - 0)) = 1 + 32/125 = 157/125 = 1.256. Correct.But what about as x approaches 0+, y approaches -2 + ∞ = ∞. Therefore, the function y starts at ∞, decreases to a minimum, then increases to 157/125. Wait, but is that possible? If y is decreasing from ∞ to a minimum and then increasing again to 157/125, then the minimum would be the lowest point. But 157/125 ≈1.256 is less than the AM-GM lower bound of 0.4? Wait, no. 1.256 is larger than 0.4. Wait, this seems conflicting.Wait, if as x approaches π/2, y approaches 1.256, and as x approaches 0, y approaches ∞, and if the function has a critical point where it reaches a minimum, then the range would be [minimum, ∞). But earlier, the AM-GM gave a lower bound of 0.4, but we saw that it&#39;s not achievable. So maybe the minimum is higher than 0.4.Alternatively, maybe the function decreases monotonically from ∞ to 157/125. But that would mean the range is (157/125, ∞). But that contradicts the earlier thought that there might be a minimum. Wait, let&#39;s check the derivative.Earlier, we found that dy/dx is:cos x + 2 sin x - (32/125) * [1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x] / [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2.As x approaches 0+, let&#39;s analyze the derivative:cos x ~1, sin x ~x, 1 - cos x ~x^2/2.So, the third term in derivative:[1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x] ~1 +1 -2*1 =0. Wait, compute more carefully.1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x = 1 + (1 - x^2/2) - 2(1 - x^2) + ... (using cos x ~1 - x^2/2 for small x).Wait, let&#39;s compute:cos x ~1 - x^2/2,so 1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x ≈1 + (1 - x^2/2) - 2(1 - x^2) = 2 - x^2/2 - 2 + 2x^2 = ( - x^2/2 + 2x^2 ) = (3x^2)/2.Denominator [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2 ~ (x * x^2/2)^2 = (x^3 /2)^2 = x^6 /4.Thus, the third term in derivative is approximately:(32/125) * (3x^2 /2) / (x^6 /4) ) = (32/125) * (3x^2 /2) * (4 /x^6 ) = (32/125) * (6 /x^4 ) = 192/(125 x^4).Therefore, the derivative dy/dx ~1 + 2x - 192/(125 x^4).As x approaches 0+, the term -192/(125 x^4) dominates, so derivative approaches -infty. Therefore, the function is decreasing steeply as x approaches 0+.At x approaching π/2, let&#39;s analyze the derivative:cos x ~0, sin x ~1, 1 - cos x ~1.So, compute each term:cos x ~0,2 sin x ~2,third term: [1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x] ~1 +0 -0=1,denominator [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2 ~(1 *1)^2=1.Thus, the third term ~ -32/(125 *1) = -32/125 ≈ -0.256.Therefore, derivative ~0 + 2 - (-0.256) Wait, no:Wait, the derivative is:cos x + 2 sin x - (32/125)*[1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x]/[sin x (1 - cos x)]^2.At x approaching π/2, this becomes:0 + 2*1 - (32/125)*1/1 = 2 - 32/125 ≈ 2 - 0.256 ≈1.744, which is positive. Therefore, the derivative approaches approximately 1.744 as x approaches π/2, which is positive.Therefore, near x=0, derivative is negative (function decreasing), and near x=π/2, derivative is positive (function increasing). Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one critical point in (0, π/2) where the derivative is zero, which is a local minimum. Therefore, the function y decreases from ∞ to this local minimum, then increases to 157/125 ≈1.256. Hence, the range of y is [ymin, ∞), where ymin is the value at this critical point.Therefore, we need to find ymin. Since solving the derivative equation analytically is difficult, maybe we can use substitution or numerical methods.Let me try to make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let’s go back to the substitution θ = x/2. Then x = 2θ, θ ∈ (0, π/4). Let’s also let t = sin θ. Then, as before, sin x = 2 sin θ cos θ = 2t sqrt(1 - t^2), cos x = 1 - 2t^2, and the denominator term sin x (1 - cos x) = 4 t^3 sqrt(1 - t^2).But maybe this is still not helpful. Alternatively, let me try setting t = 1 - cos x. Then, since x ∈ (0, π/2), t ∈ (0, 1 - cos(π/2)) = (0, 1). Also, we can express sin x in terms of t:sin x = sqrt(1 - (1 - t)^2) = sqrt(2t - t^2).Therefore, the function y becomes:y = sqrt(2t - t^2) - 2(1 - t) + 32/(125 sqrt(2t - t^2) * t).Simplify:y = sqrt(t(2 - t)) - 2 + 2t + 32/(125 t sqrt(t(2 - t))).Combine terms:Let’s denote s = sqrt(t(2 - t)). Then, s = sqrt(t(2 - t)), so s^2 = t(2 - t).Therefore, y = s - 2 + 2t + 32/(125 t s).But s = sqrt(t(2 - t)), so s = sqrt(2t - t^2). Not sure if this helps. Maybe express in terms of s:But s^2 = 2t - t^2 =&gt; t^2 - 2t + s^2 = 0. Not sure.Alternatively, write y in terms of t and s:y = s + 2t - 2 + 32/(125 t s).Let me consider variables t and s, but since s = sqrt(2t - t^2), which is a function of t, this might not add much.Alternatively, perhaps set u = t s = t sqrt(2t - t^2). Then, 32/(125 u) is part of y. But still not clear.Alternatively, let me consider substituting t = 1 - cos x again. Let me try to compute the derivative in terms of t.We have t = 1 - cos x, so dt/dx = sin x. Therefore, dx/dt = 1/sin x. Also, we can express sin x = sqrt(2t - t^2).Therefore, we can write y as a function of t:y(t) = sqrt(2t - t^2) - 2(1 - t) + 32/(125 sqrt(2t - t^2) * t).Therefore, dy/dt = derivative of y with respect to t.Compute dy/dt:First term: d/dt [sqrt(2t - t^2)] = (2 - 2t)/(2 sqrt(2t - t^2)) = (1 - t)/sqrt(2t - t^2).Second term: d/dt [-2(1 - t)] = 2.Third term: d/dt [32/(125 t sqrt(2t - t^2))] = -32/(125) * d/dt [1/(t sqrt(2t - t^2))].Let’s compute derivative of 1/(t sqrt(2t - t^2)):Let’s denote f(t) = t sqrt(2t - t^2). Then, d/dt [1/f(t)] = -f’(t)/[f(t)]^2.Compute f(t) = t sqrt(2t - t^2). Then,f’(t) = sqrt(2t - t^2) + t * (2 - 2t)/(2 sqrt(2t - t^2)).Simplify:f’(t) = sqrt(2t - t^2) + t(2 - 2t)/(2 sqrt(2t - t^2)).Combine terms over a common denominator:= [2(2t - t^2) + t(2 - 2t)] / (2 sqrt(2t - t^2))= [4t - 2t^2 + 2t - 2t^2] / (2 sqrt(2t - t^2))= (6t - 4t^2) / (2 sqrt(2t - t^2))= (2t(3 - 2t)) / (2 sqrt(2t - t^2))= t(3 - 2t)/sqrt(2t - t^2).Therefore, derivative of 1/f(t) is -f’(t)/[f(t)]^2 = - [ t(3 - 2t)/sqrt(2t - t^2) ] / [t^2(2t - t^2)].Simplify denominator [t^2(2t - t^2)] = t^2(2t - t^2).Therefore, derivative is - [ t(3 - 2t)/sqrt(2t - t^2) ] / [ t^2(2t - t^2) ) ] = - (3 - 2t) / [ t (2t - t^2 )^(3/2) ) ].Therefore, the derivative of the third term is -32/125 * [ - (3 - 2t) / ( t (2t - t^2 )^(3/2) ) ) ] = (32/125)(3 - 2t)/( t (2t - t^2 )^(3/2) ) ).Therefore, overall, dy/dt is:(1 - t)/sqrt(2t - t^2) + 2 + (32/125)(3 - 2t)/( t (2t - t^2 )^(3/2) ) ).Set this equal to zero for critical points:(1 - t)/sqrt(2t - t^2) + 2 + (32/125)(3 - 2t)/( t (2t - t^2 )^(3/2) ) ) = 0.This equation still looks very complicated. Perhaps numerical methods are needed here. Alternatively, guess a value of t that simplifies the equation.Let’s try t = 1. But t = 1 - cos x, and x ∈ (0, π/2), so t ∈ (0, 1). So t=1 is at x=π/2, which is excluded. How about t=0.5? Let me plug t=0.5 into the equation.First, compute each term:First term: (1 - 0.5)/sqrt(2*0.5 - 0.5^2) = 0.5 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 / sqrt(0.75) ≈0.5 /0.866 ≈0.577.Second term: 2.Third term: (32/125)(3 - 2*0.5)/(0.5*(2*0.5 -0.5^2)^(3/2)) = (32/125)(3 -1)/(0.5*(1 -0.25)^(3/2)) = (32/125)(2)/(0.5*(0.75)^(3/2)).Compute denominator: 0.5*(0.75)^(3/2). 0.75^(3/2) = (sqrt(0.75))^3 ≈ (0.866)^3 ≈0.6495. Then 0.5*0.6495 ≈0.3248.So numerator: 32/125 * 2 ≈64/125 ≈0.512.Therefore, third term ≈0.512 /0.3248 ≈1.576.Therefore, total dy/dt ≈0.577 +2 +1.576 ≈4.153 &gt;0. So derivative positive at t=0.5.Try t=0.4.First term: (1 -0.4)/sqrt(0.8 -0.16)=0.6/sqrt(0.64)=0.6/0.8=0.75.Second term: 2.Third term: (32/125)(3 -0.8)/(0.4*(0.8 -0.16)^(3/2))= (32/125)(2.2)/(0.4*(0.64)^(3/2)).Compute denominator:0.4*(0.64)^(3/2)=0.4*(0.8)^3=0.4*0.512=0.2048.Numerator:32/125*2.2≈(0.256)*2.2≈0.5632.Third term≈0.5632/0.2048≈2.75.Total dy/dt≈0.75+2+2.75≈5.5&gt;0.Still positive. Let&#39;s try a smaller t, say t=0.2.First term: (1 -0.2)/sqrt(0.4 -0.04)=0.8/sqrt(0.36)=0.8/0.6≈1.333.Second term:2.Third term:(32/125)(3 -0.4)/(0.2*(0.4 -0.04)^(3/2))=(32/125)(2.6)/(0.2*(0.36)^(3/2)).Compute denominator:0.2*(0.36)^(3/2)=0.2*(0.6)^3=0.2*0.216=0.0432.Numerator:32/125*2.6≈0.256*2.6≈0.6656.Third term≈0.6656/0.0432≈15.4.Total dy/dt≈1.333+2+15.4≈18.733&gt;0.Still positive. Hmm, so derivative is positive at t=0.2, 0.4, 0.5. But earlier analysis suggested that near t=0 (x approaches 0), derivative is negative. So, there must be a point where derivative transitions from negative to positive. Let&#39;s try a very small t, say t=0.1.First term: (1 -0.1)/sqrt(0.2 -0.01)=0.9/sqrt(0.19)≈0.9/0.435≈2.069.Second term:2.Third term:(32/125)(3 -0.2)/(0.1*(0.2 -0.01)^(3/2))=(32/125)(2.8)/(0.1*(0.19)^(3/2)).Compute denominator:0.1*(0.19)^(3/2). First, sqrt(0.19)≈0.435, so (0.19)^(3/2)=0.19*0.435≈0.0827. Then, denominator=0.1*0.0827≈0.00827.Numerator=32/125*2.8≈0.256*2.8≈0.7168.Third term≈0.7168 /0.00827≈86.67.Total dy/dt≈2.069+2+86.67≈90.739&gt;0. Still positive. Wait, but earlier analysis said as t approaches 0, derivative approaches negative infinity. Wait, there&#39;s a discrepancy here. Did I make a mistake?Wait, when we computed the derivative as x approaches 0+, we saw that dy/dx approaches -infty. However, here we&#39;re computing dy/dt, which is dy/dx * dx/dt. Since dt/dx = sin x ~x, so dx/dt ~1/x. Therefore, dy/dt = dy/dx * dx/dt ~ (-infty) * (1/x) ~ -infty * infty. But this is indeterminate. Wait, but x approaches 0, so t =1 - cos x ~x^2/2. Therefore, t ~x^2/2, x ~sqrt(2t). Therefore, dx/dt ~1/sin x ~1/x ~1/sqrt(2t).Therefore, dy/dt = dy/dx * dx/dt ~ (-C/t^4) * (1/sqrt(t)) ) = -C / t^{4.5} ), which tends to -infty as t approaches 0. Therefore, dy/dt approaches -infty as t approaches 0. Therefore, there must be a point where dy/dt transitions from -infty to positive. Therefore, there exists some t in (0, 1) where dy/dt=0. But in our trials with t=0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, dy/dt was positive. So, perhaps the critical point is very close to t=0.But this contradicts our initial analysis where we thought the function y decreases from ∞ to a minimum and then increases to ~1.256. However, according to the derivative dy/dt computed at several points t&gt;0, dy/dt is positive, which suggests that y(t) is increasing for t ∈ (0,1). But this contradicts the earlier analysis. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the derivative calculation.Wait, let me re-examine the substitution.We set t =1 - cos x, so dt/dx = sin x.Therefore, dy/dx = dy/dt * dt/dx = dy/dt * sin x.But we computed dy/dt as:(1 - t)/sqrt(2t - t^2) + 2 + (32/125)(3 - 2t)/( t (2t - t^2 )^(3/2) ) ).But sin x = sqrt(2t - t^2). Therefore, dy/dx = [above expression] * sqrt(2t - t^2).Therefore, the sign of dy/dx depends on the sign of dy/dt * sqrt(2t - t^2). Since sqrt(2t - t^2) is positive, the sign of dy/dx is the same as dy/dt.But earlier analysis said that near t=0 (x approaches 0), dy/dx approaches -infty, but according to our trials, dy/dt is positive. This inconsistency suggests a mistake in the calculation.Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the sign of the third term. Let me recheck the derivative of the third term.The third term in y is 32/(125 sin x (1 - cos x)) = 32/(125 s t), where s = sin x and t =1 - cos x.When we computed the derivative of this term with respect to t, we went through several steps. Let me verify:We have y = ... + 32/(125 s t).Then, dy/dt = derivative of 32/(125 s t) with respect to t.But s = sqrt(2t - t^2), so s depends on t.Thus, dy/dt for the third term is -32/(125) * [ derivative(s t) / (s t)^2 ]. derivative(s t) = s&#39; t + s *1.Compute s&#39; = derivative of sqrt(2t - t^2) = (2 - 2t)/(2 sqrt(2t - t^2)) = (1 - t)/s.Therefore, derivative(s t) = (1 - t)/s * t + s = t(1 - t)/s + s.Then, dy/dt for the third term is -32/(125) * [ t(1 - t)/s + s ] / (s t)^2.Simplify numerator:t(1 - t)/s + s = [ t(1 - t) + s^2 ] /s.But s^2 =2t -t^2, so numerator:t(1 - t) +2t - t^2 = t - t^2 +2t -t^2 =3t -2t^2.Therefore, dy/dt for the third term is -32/(125) * (3t -2t^2)/s / (s t)^2 = -32/(125) * (3t -2t^2)/(s^3 t^2).But s = sqrt(2t -t^2), so s^3 = (2t -t^2)^(3/2).Therefore, dy/dt for the third term is -32/(125) * (3t -2t^2)/( (2t -t^2)^(3/2) t^2 ).But in our previous calculation, we had:(32/125)(3 - 2t)/( t (2t - t^2 )^(3/2) ) ).Wait, there&#39;s a discrepancy. The correct expression should have (3t - 2t^2) in the numerator, but here it&#39;s written as (3 - 2t). Therefore, there was a mistake in the derivative calculation.So, correcting that:The third term&#39;s derivative is:-32/(125) * (3t -2t^2)/( (2t -t^2)^(3/2) t^2 ).But this is different from what I computed earlier. Therefore, the previous calculations were incorrect.This is a critical mistake. So let&#39;s recast the derivative computation.Given:y(t) = sqrt(2t -t^2) -2(1 -t) +32/(125 sqrt(2t -t^2) t).Compute dy/dt:First term derivative: (1 -t)/sqrt(2t -t^2).Second term derivative: 2.Third term derivative:Let’s denote f(t) = sqrt(2t -t^2) t.Then, 32/(125 f(t)).So, derivative is -32/(125 f(t)^2) * f’(t).Compute f’(t):f(t) = t sqrt(2t -t^2).f’(t) = sqrt(2t -t^2) + t*(2 -2t)/(2 sqrt(2t -t^2)) = [ (2t -t^2) + t(1 -t) ] / sqrt(2t -t^2) = [2t -t^2 +t -t^2]/sqrt(2t -t^2) = (3t -2t^2)/sqrt(2t -t^2).Therefore, derivative of third term is -32/(125) * (3t -2t^2)/sqrt(2t -t^2) / (t sqrt(2t -t^2))^2 ).Simplify denominator: (t sqrt(2t -t^2))^2 = t^2 (2t -t^2).Therefore, derivative is:-32/(125) * (3t -2t^2) / [ sqrt(2t -t^2) * t^2 (2t -t^2) ) ] = -32/(125) * (3t -2t^2) / [ t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2) ) ].Therefore, dy/dt is:(1 -t)/sqrt(2t -t^2) + 2 - 32(3t -2t^2)/(125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2)).Now, this is the correct expression for dy/dt.This is still complicated, but perhaps we can factor terms.Let’s write dy/dt as:Term1 + Term2 + Term3.Where:Term1 = (1 - t)/sqrt(2t - t^2),Term2 = 2,Term3 = -32(3t -2t^2)/(125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2)).To find when dy/dt =0, need to solve:(1 - t)/sqrt(2t - t^2) + 2 = 32(3t -2t^2)/(125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2)).Let me multiply both sides by 125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2) to eliminate denominators:125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2) [ (1 - t)/sqrt(2t - t^2) + 2 ] = 32(3t -2t^2).Simplify left-hand side (LHS):First term: 125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2) * (1 - t)/sqrt(2t -t^2) = 125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^{(3/2 -1/2)} (1 -t) = 125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^1 (1 -t) =125 t^2 (2t -t^2)(1 -t).Second term: 125 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2)*2 = 250 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2).Therefore, LHS = 125 t^2 (2t -t^2)(1 -t) + 250 t^2 (2t -t^2)^(3/2).RHS =32(3t -2t^2).This equation is still highly non-linear and likely requires numerical methods to solve.Given the complexity, perhaps we can assume a substitution that simplifies the equation. Let me let u = t, and attempt trial values.Let’s try t=0.5:Compute LHS:125*(0.5)^2*(2*0.5 -0.5^2)*(1 -0.5) +250*(0.5)^2*(2*0.5 -0.5^2)^(3/2).First part:125*(0.25)*(1 -0.25)*(0.5)=125*0.25*0.75*0.5=125*0.09375=11.71875.Second part:250*(0.25)*(1 -0.25)^(3/2)=250*0.25*(0.75)^(3/2).Compute (0.75)^(3/2)=sqrt(0.75)^3≈0.866^3≈0.6495.Thus, second part≈250*0.25*0.6495≈250*0.1624≈40.6.Total LHS≈11.71875 +40.6≈52.31875.RHS=32*(1.5 -0.5)=32*1=32.Thus, 52.31875 ≈52.32 ≈32? Not equal. So LHS &gt; RHS at t=0.5.Now, try t=0.6:t=0.6.First part:125*(0.6)^2*(2*0.6 -0.6^2)*(1 -0.6)=125*0.36*(1.2 -0.36)*0.4=125*0.36*0.84*0.4=125*0.12096≈15.12.Second part:250*(0.6)^2*(2*0.6 -0.6^2)^(3/2).Compute (2*0.6 -0.36)=1.2 -0.36=0.84.Thus, 250*0.36*(0.84)^(3/2).Compute (0.84)^(3/2)=sqrt(0.84)^3≈0.9165^3≈0.770.Thus, second part≈250*0.36*0.770≈250*0.2772≈69.3.Total LHS≈15.12 +69.3≈84.42.RHS=32*(1.8 -0.72)=32*1.08≈34.56.Still LHS &gt; RHS.Try t=0.7:First part:125*(0.7)^2*(2*0.7 -0.49)*(0.3)=125*0.49*(1.4 -0.49)*0.3=125*0.49*0.91*0.3≈125*0.133≈16.625.Second part:250*(0.7)^2*(2*0.7 -0.49)^(3/2)=250*0.49*(1.4 -0.49)^(3/2)=250*0.49*(0.91)^(3/2).Compute (0.91)^(3/2)=sqrt(0.91)^3≈0.9539^3≈0.868.Thus, second part≈250*0.49*0.868≈250*0.425≈106.25.Total LHS≈16.625 +106.25≈122.875.RHS=32*(2.1 -0.98)=32*1.12≈35.84.LHS still &gt; RHS.Now, try t=0.8:First part:125*(0.8)^2*(1.6 -0.64)*(0.2)=125*0.64*0.96*0.2=125*0.12288≈15.36.Second part:250*(0.8)^2*(1.6 -0.64)^(3/2)=250*0.64*(0.96)^(3/2).Compute (0.96)^(3/2)=sqrt(0.96)^3≈0.98^3≈0.941.Thus, second part≈250*0.64*0.941≈250*0.602≈150.5.Total LHS≈15.36 +150.5≈165.86.RHS=32*(2.4 -1.28)=32*1.12≈35.84.Still LHS &gt; RHS.Try t=0.9:First part:125*(0.81)*(1.8 -0.81)*(0.1)=125*0.81*0.99*0.1≈125*0.080≈10.Second part:250*(0.81)*(1.8 -0.81)^(3/2)=250*0.81*(0.99)^(3/2).Compute (0.99)^(3/2)=sqrt(0.99)^3≈0.995^3≈0.985.Thus, second part≈250*0.81*0.985≈250*0.798≈199.5.Total LHS≈10 +199.5≈209.5.RHS=32*(2.7 -1.62)=32*1.08≈34.56.Still LHS &gt; RHS.So, in all these cases, LHS &gt; RHS. How about t approaching 1? Let’s try t=0.99:First part:125*(0.99)^2*(1.98 -0.9801)*(0.01)≈125*0.9801*0.9999*0.01≈125*0.0098≈1.225.Second part:250*(0.99)^2*(1.98 -0.9801)^(3/2)=250*0.9801*(0.9999)^(3/2)≈250*0.9801*0.9999≈250*0.9799≈244.975.Total LHS≈1.225 +244.975≈246.2.RHS=32*(2.97 -1.9602)=32*1.0098≈32.313.LHS &gt; RHS.This suggests that for all t ∈ (0,1), LHS &gt; RHS, which would mean dy/dt &gt;0 for all t ∈ (0,1), implying y(t) is increasing on (0,1). But this contradicts the earlier analysis where as x approaches 0, dy/dx approaches -infty. So, there must be a mistake.Wait, let&#39;s re-express the original derivative correctly.Earlier, we found dy/dx = cos x + 2 sin x - (32/125) * [1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x] / [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2.Perhaps instead of substituting t =1 - cos x, compute dy/dx directly.Let me pick some x values and compute dy/dx numerically.Take x approaching 0, say x=0.1 radians.Compute dy/dx:cos(0.1) ≈0.995,sin(0.1)≈0.0998,1 - cos(0.1)≈0.005,1 + cos x - 2 cos^2 x ≈1 +0.995 -2*(0.995)^2≈1 +0.995 -2*0.990≈1.995 -1.98≈0.015. denominator [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2≈(0.0998*0.005)^2≈(0.000499)^2≈2.49e-7.Third term: (32/125) *0.015 /2.49e-7 ≈(0.256) *0.015 /2.49e-7≈0.00384 /2.49e-7≈15421.Thus, dy/dx≈0.995 +2*0.0998 -15421≈0.995 +0.1996 -15421≈-15420, which is very negative, as expected.Now take x=0.5 radians.Compute:cos(0.5)≈0.87758,sin(0.5)≈0.4794,1 - cos(0.5)≈0.12242,1 + cos x -2 cos^2x≈1 +0.87758 -2*(0.87758)^2≈1 +0.87758 -2*0.770≈1.87758 -1.54≈0.33758. denominator [0.4794*0.12242]^2≈(0.0587)^2≈0.00344.Third term: (32/125)*0.33758 /0.00344≈0.256*0.33758 /0.00344≈0.0863 /0.00344≈25.09.Therefore, dy/dx≈0.87758 +2*0.4794 -25.09≈0.87758 +0.9588 -25.09≈-23.25, still negative.Take x=1 radian.cos(1)≈0.5403,sin(1)≈0.8415,1 - cos(1)≈0.4597,1 + cos x -2 cos²x≈1 +0.5403 -2*(0.5403)^2≈1 +0.5403 -2*0.2919≈1.5403 -0.5838≈0.9565.denominator [0.8415*0.4597]^2≈(0.386)^2≈0.149.Third term: (32/125)*0.9565 /0.149≈0.256*0.9565 /0.149≈0.245 /0.149≈1.645.Therefore, dy/dx≈0.5403 +2*0.8415 -1.645≈0.5403 +1.683 -1.645≈0.5403 +0.038≈0.578, positive.So, at x=1 radian (~57 degrees), dy/dx is positive.At x=0.5 radian (~28.6 degrees), dy/dx is negative.Therefore, there must be a critical point between x=0.5 and x=1 where dy/dx=0.Let’s use the Intermediate Value Theorem to approximate.At x=0.5: dy/dx≈-23.25.At x=1: dy/dx≈+0.578.Let’s try x=0.8 radian.cos(0.8)≈0.6967,sin(0.8)≈0.7174,1 - cos(0.8)≈0.3033,1 + cos x -2 cos²x≈1 +0.6967 -2*(0.6967)^2≈1 +0.6967 -2*0.4854≈1.6967 -0.9708≈0.7259. denominator [0.7174*0.3033]^2≈(0.2176)^2≈0.04735.Third term: (32/125)*0.7259 /0.04735≈0.256*0.7259 /0.04735≈0.1858 /0.04735≈3.924. dy/dx≈0.6967 +2*0.7174 -3.924≈0.6967 +1.4348 -3.924≈2.1315 -3.924≈-1.7925, still negative.Try x=0.9 radian.cos(0.9)≈0.6216,sin(0.9)≈0.7833,1 - cos(0.9)≈0.3784,1 + cos x -2 cos²x≈1 +0.6216 -2*(0.6216)^2≈1 +0.6216 -2*0.3864≈1.6216 -0.7728≈0.8488. denominator [0.7833*0.3784]^2≈(0.2965)^2≈0.0879.Third term: (32/125)*0.8488 /0.0879≈0.256*0.8488 /0.0879≈0.2173 /0.0879≈2.472. dy/dx≈0.6216 +2*0.7833 -2.472≈0.6216 +1.5666 -2.472≈2.1882 -2.472≈-0.2838, still negative.x=0.95 radian:cos(0.95)≈0.5695,sin(0.95)≈0.8134,1 - cos(0.95)≈0.4305,1 + cos x -2 cos²x≈1 +0.5695 -2*(0.5695)^2≈1 +0.5695 -2*0.3243≈1.5695 -0.6486≈0.9209. denominator [0.8134*0.4305]^2≈(0.3503)^2≈0.1227.Third term: (32/125)*0.9209 /0.1227≈0.256*0.9209 /0.1227≈0.2358 /0.1227≈1.922. dy/dx≈0.5695 +2*0.8134 -1.922≈0.5695 +1.6268 -1.922≈2.1963 -1.922≈0.2743, positive.Therefore, between x=0.9 and x=0.95 radian, dy/dx crosses zero.Use linear approximation:Between x=0.9 and x=0.95:At x=0.9, dy/dx≈-0.2838,At x=0.95, dy/dx≈+0.2743.The zero crossing is at x=0.9 + (0 - (-0.2838))*(0.05)/(0.2743 - (-0.2838)) ≈0.9 + (0.2838*0.05)/0.5581≈0.9 +0.0255≈0.9255 radian.Compute at x=0.9255:Approximate dy/dx≈0. Hence, the critical point is around x≈0.9255 radian.Compute y at this critical point to find the minimum value.But since this is cumbersome, perhaps use x=0.9255 radian for approximation.Compute x=0.9255:cos x≈cos(0.9255)≈0.6,sin x≈sqrt(1 -0.6^2)=0.8.Wait, but 0.9255 radians is approximately 53 degrees, where cos x≈0.6 and sin x≈0.8.But this is a rough estimate. Let me compute more accurately.Alternatively, use Newton-Raphson method to find the root of dy/dx=0 between x=0.9 and x=0.95.Let’s denote f(x)=dy/dx.We have:At x=0.9, f(x)≈-0.2838,At x=0.95, f(x)≈0.2743.Assume f(x) is roughly linear between these points.The root x where f(x)=0 is x=0.9 + (0 - (-0.2838))/(0.2743 - (-0.2838))*(0.05)≈0.9 +0.2838/0.5581*0.05≈0.9 +0.0255≈0.9255 radian.Compute f(0.9255):Estimate cos(0.9255) and sin(0.9255):0.9255 rad ≈53.06 degrees.cos(53.06°)≈0.6,sin(53.06°)≈0.8.But more accurately:Using calculator:cos(0.9255)=approx 0.599,sin(0.9255)=approx 0.800.1 - cos x≈0.401,1 + cos x -2 cos²x≈1 +0.599 -2*(0.599)^2≈1.599 -2*0.3588≈1.599 -0.7176≈0.8814. denominator [sin x (1 - cos x)]^2≈(0.8*0.401)^2≈(0.3208)^2≈0.1029.Third term: (32/125)*0.8814 /0.1029≈0.256*0.8814 /0.1029≈0.2258 /0.1029≈2.194. dy/dx≈0.599 +2*0.8 -2.194≈0.599 +1.6 -2.194≈2.199 -2.194≈0.005.Very close to zero. Therefore, x≈0.9255 radian is the critical point.Compute y at x≈0.9255:y=sin x -2 cos x +32/(125 sin x (1 - cos x)).Using approximate values:sin x≈0.8,cos x≈0.6,1 - cos x≈0.4.Thus,y≈0.8 -2*0.6 +32/(125*0.8*0.4)=0.8 -1.2 +32/(40)= -0.4 +0.8=0.4.But this is an approximation. To compute more accurately:Compute sin(0.9255)≈0.800,cos(0.9255)≈0.599,1 - cos x≈0.401.Thus,y=0.8 -2*0.599 +32/(125*0.8*0.401)=0.8 -1.198 +32/(40.1)= -0.398 +0.797≈0.399≈0.4.Therefore, the minimum value of y is approximately 0.4, which is 2/5. This matches the earlier AM-GM lower bound, even though equality wasn&#39;t achievable in the domain. However, in reality, due to the function&#39;s behavior, the minimum is indeed approximately 0.4, achieved near x≈0.9255 radians.But wait, the AM-GM gave a lower bound of 2/5=0.4, but we saw that the equality condition led to t=1/√5≈0.447, which is outside the domain for u in the substitution. However, through calculus, we found that the minimum is indeed around 0.4, achieved at x≈53 degrees. Therefore, the range of y is [2/5, ∞).But wait, the exact minimum might not be exactly 2/5, but very close to it. However, since the problem asks for the range, and given that the AM-GM suggests the lower bound is 2/5, and our numerical calculation supports it, even if the exact minimum is slightly above 0.4, due to the problem context, the answer is likely [2/5, ∞).But need to verify if the minimum is exactly 2/5.Given that at x where the critical point occurs, y≈0.4, which is 2/5=0.4, this suggests that the minimum is exactly 2/5. Therefore, the function’s range is [2/5, ∞).But need to confirm.Let me check the substitution where we set a = 4u^2, b = 2u v, c = 8/(125 u^3 v). The product a*b*c = 64/125, and AM-GM gives a + b + c ≥ 12/5, so y = a + b + c - 2 ≥ 12/5 - 2 = 2/5.However, equality in AM-GM requires a = b = c. Let&#39;s check if this is possible.Set a = b: 4u^2 = 2u v ⇒ 2u = v.Since u = sin(theta), v = cos(theta), and u^2 + v^2 = 1, then:u^2 + (2u)^2 =1 ⇒5u^2 =1 ⇒u=1/√5, v=2/√5.But in this substitution, theta ∈ (0, π/4), so u = sin(theta) ∈ (0, sin(π/4)) = (0, √2/2 ≈0.707). But 1/√5≈0.447 &lt;0.707, so it is within the domain.Wait, previously, I thought u ∈ (0, sin(π/8)), but that was in a different substitution. Here, theta is x/2, so theta ∈ (0, π/4), hence u = sin(theta) ∈ (0, sin(π/4))≈(0,0.707). Therefore, u=1/√5≈0.447 is within the domain.Therefore, equality in AM-GM is achievable at u=1/√5, v=2/√5. Therefore, the minimum value of 2/5 is indeed attainable.But wait, in our previous analysis using calculus, we found that the minimum occurs at x≈0.9255 radians, which corresponds to theta=0.9255/2≈0.46275 radians≈26.5 degrees. Then, u=sin(theta)≈sin(0.46275)≈0.447≈1/√5, which matches the AM-GM equality condition.Therefore, the minimum value of y is indeed 2/5, achieved when u=1/√5, i.e., when sin(theta)=1/√5. Therefore, the range of y is [2/5, ∞).Therefore, the final answer is boxed{[dfrac{2}{5}, +infty)}.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>✅:</span>To determine the range of the function ( y = sin x - 2 cos x + frac{32}{125 sin x (1 - cos x)} ) for ( 0 &lt; x &lt; frac{pi}{2} ), we start by analyzing the function and applying calculus and the AM-GM inequality.1. Function Analysis:   - The function consists of trigonometric terms and a fractional term.   - The fractional term (frac{32}{125 sin x (1 - cos x)}) complicates the analysis, so we consider using substitutions and transformations.2. Substitution and Simplification:   - Using trigonometric identities, we rewrite the denominator ( sin x (1 - cos x) ) in terms of (sin frac{x}{2}) and (cos frac{x}{2}).   - This leads to expressing the function in terms of (theta = frac{x}{2}), but further simplification is still complex.3. AM-GM Inequality Application:   - We split the function into three parts and apply the AM-GM inequality to these parts.   - Let ( a = 4u^2 ), ( b = 2uv ), and ( c = frac{8}{125u^3v} ), where ( u = sin theta ) and ( v = cos theta ).   - By AM-GM, we find ( a + b + c geq frac{12}{5} ), leading to ( y geq frac{2}{5} ).4. Verification with Calculus:   - We compute the derivative ( frac{dy}{dx} ) and analyze its behavior.   - Numerical methods and critical point analysis show that the function has a minimum value at ( x approx 0.9255 ) radians, where ( y approx 0.4 ), confirming the AM-GM result.5. Conclusion:   - The minimum value of the function is exactly ( frac{2}{5} ), achieved when the conditions for equality in the AM-GM inequality are met.   - As ( x ) approaches ( 0 ) or ( frac{pi}{2} ), the function tends to infinity or a finite value, respectively.The range of the function ( y ) is (boxed{[dfrac{2}{5}, +infty)}).</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>🔑:</span>Given the function ( y = sin x - 2 cos x + frac{32}{125 sin x (1 - cos x)} ) for ( 0 &lt; x &lt; frac{pi}{2} ), we are to determine the range of ( y ).1.

Recognize that ( sin x &gt; 0 ) for ( 0 &lt; x &lt; frac{pi}{2} ):   Since ( sin x ) is always positive within this interval, the terms involving ( sin x ) do not equal zero.3.

So, we have a field divided into equal squares with paths, and gardeners live at all the vertices of these squares. Each flower is taken care of by the three nearest gardeners. The task is to draw all the flowers that are looked after by one of the gardeners. Hmm, that&#39;s interesting. Let me break this down.First, I need to visualize the setup. Imagine a grid of squares, like graph paper. Each intersection point (vertex) has a gardener. The flowers are in the squares, right? Wait, the problem says the field is divided into equal squares by paths, so the flowers would be in the squares themselves. Each flower is cared for by the three nearest gardeners. So, for any given flower, we need to find the three closest vertices (gardeners) and determine which gardener is responsible for which flowers.The question asks to draw all the flowers that are looked after by one of the gardeners. So, we need to pick a specific gardener and then figure out all the flowers for which this gardener is one of the three nearest. Let&#39;s pick a gardener first. Maybe start with a central one to make it symmetric, but perhaps it&#39;s easier to consider a corner or edge gardener first? Wait, maybe all gardeners will have similar regions, just positioned differently. Let&#39;s think about the Voronoi diagram concept here. Voronoi diagrams partition space into regions based on proximity to points. But here, each flower is assigned to three nearest gardeners, so it&#39;s a bit different. Instead of a single nearest neighbor, it&#39;s the three nearest. So, each flower belongs to the intersection of three Voronoi regions? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.In a standard Voronoi diagram, each region consists of all points closer to a particular seed (gardener here) than any other. But here, each flower is assigned to three nearest gardeners. So, for each flower, we need the three closest gardeners. Therefore, the set of flowers assigned to a particular gardener would be those where the gardener is among the three closest. So, each gardener&#39;s region would be the union of all flowers where they are in the top three nearest.But how do these regions look? Let&#39;s consider a grid of squares with gardeners at each vertex. Let&#39;s assume the squares have side length 1 for simplicity. So, each square has vertices at integer coordinates. For example, a gardener at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), etc.Now, take a flower located somewhere in a square. The flower&#39;s position can be anywhere in the square. Let&#39;s take a flower at position (x,y) within a square whose lower-left vertex is (0,0). So, the square goes from (0,0) to (1,1). The flower&#39;s coordinates are (x,y) where 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 and 0 &lt; y &lt; 1.The nearest gardeners would be the four vertices of the square: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But the problem says the three nearest. Wait, in a square, the distances from a flower to the four corners can vary. Depending on where the flower is, some distances will be closer than others. For example, if the flower is near the center of the square, all four distances are about equal. But as it moves towards a corner, that corner becomes the closest, then the adjacent two corners, and the opposite corner is the farthest.But the problem states that each flower is looked after by the three nearest gardeners. So, for any flower, we need to pick the three closest vertices. Let&#39;s compute the distances. Let&#39;s take the flower at (x,y) in the square [0,1]x[0,1]. The distances to the four corners are:- d1 = sqrt(x² + y²) to (0,0)- d2 = sqrt((1-x)² + y²) to (1,0)- d3 = sqrt(x² + (1-y)²) to (0,1)- d4 = sqrt((1-x)² + (1-y)²) to (1,1)We need to find the three smallest distances. Alternatively, since sqrt is monotonic, we can compare squared distances:- d1² = x² + y²- d2² = (1-x)² + y²- d3² = x² + (1-y)²- d4² = (1-x)² + (1-y)²So, for the flower at (x,y), we need to order these four squared distances and pick the smallest three. The gardener at the vertex with the largest squared distance is excluded.Our goal is to determine for a specific gardener, say (0,0), all the flowers (x,y) where (0,0) is among the three closest. Similarly, this would apply to any gardener, but let&#39;s focus on (0,0).So, we need the set of (x,y) in the grid where d1² is not the largest of the four distances. Because if it&#39;s not the largest, then (0,0) is among the three closest. Alternatively, the region where d1² is less than at least one of the other distances.But maybe we can find the regions where each gardener is in the top three. Let&#39;s see.First, for a given square, the flower is in that square, and the four gardeners at the corners. For the gardener at (0,0), the flower (x,y) in the square [0,1]x[0,1] would have (0,0) as one of the three nearest if (0,0) is not the farthest. The farthest gardener would be the one diagonally opposite if the flower is near a corner. For example, if the flower is near (0,0), then (1,1) is the farthest. If the flower is near the center, all distances are similar, but we still have to pick three. Wait, at the exact center (0.5,0.5), all four distances are equal. But since they are equal, how do we choose three? The problem might assume general position, but perhaps in case of ties, the flower is assigned to all tied gardeners. But the problem says &quot;the three nearest gardeners,&quot; so if there&#39;s a tie for the third place, maybe we include all tied ones. However, in the grid, with flowers not at exact positions that cause ties (except the center), but perhaps the problem expects a general case. Anyway, let&#39;s proceed.To find where (0,0) is among the three closest, we need to ensure that d1² is not the largest. So, the region where d1² &lt; d4². Because d4² is the distance to the opposite corner (1,1). Similarly, we might also need to compare with other distances. Wait, but maybe the farthest gardener is not necessarily the opposite corner. For example, if the flower is near the edge (0,1), the farthest could be (1,0). Wait, let&#39;s compute.Suppose the flower is at (0.1, 0.9). Then, the distances:d1² = (0.1)^2 + (0.9)^2 = 0.01 + 0.81 = 0.82d2² = (0.9)^2 + (0.9)^2 = 0.81 + 0.81 = 1.62d3² = (0.1)^2 + (0.1)^2 = 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02d4² = (0.9)^2 + (0.1)^2 = 0.81 + 0.01 = 0.82Wait, so here, d3 is the smallest (0.02), then d1 and d4 tie at 0.82, and d2 is 1.62. So the three nearest would be (0,1), (0,0), and (1,1). Wait, but d1 and d4 are equal. So in this case, if we have to pick three, but two are tied for the third place, do we include both? The problem statement says &quot;the three nearest gardeners,&quot; so if there&#39;s a tie for the third position, perhaps both are included, making it four in total? But the problem says three. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the problem assumes that no three distances are equal, which might not hold at the center.Alternatively, perhaps in such cases, the flower is assigned to four gardeners, but the problem says three. Therefore, maybe the problem is structured such that each flower is within a unique set of three nearest gardeners, which would require that no four distances are equal. However, at the center of the square, all four distances are equal. So, this might be a special case. The problem might be intending us to ignore such edge cases or assume they don&#39;t occur. Let&#39;s proceed under that assumption, focusing on regions where there are clear three closest gardeners.Back to the gardener at (0,0). We need to find all flowers (x,y) such that (0,0) is among the three nearest gardeners. So, in the square [0,1]x[0,1], (0,0) is one of the three closest if it&#39;s not the farthest. The farthest would be either (1,1), (1,0), or (0,1), depending on where the flower is.Wait, but in the square, for any flower, the farthest gardener is the opposite corner. For example, if the flower is near (0,0), the farthest is (1,1). If the flower is near (0.5,0.5), all four are equidistant. If the flower is near the edge, say (0.5,0), then the farthest gardener might be (0,1) or (1,1). Wait, let&#39;s compute.Take a flower at (0.5,0). The distances to the four corners:d1² = (0.5)^2 + 0^2 = 0.25d2² = (0.5)^2 + 0^2 = 0.25d3² = (0.5)^2 + 1^2 = 0.25 + 1 = 1.25d4² = (0.5)^2 + 1^2 = same as d3² = 1.25So, the closest are (0,0) and (1,0), both at 0.25, then the next closest would be (0,1) and (1,1) at 1.25. So, the three nearest would be (0,0), (1,0), and either (0,1) or (1,1), but since they are tied, it&#39;s ambiguous. But the problem states three nearest, so maybe in such cases, we include all that are not the farthest. But here, two are closest, then two are next. So, the three nearest would be the two closest and one of the next? That doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, the problem says &quot;the three nearest,&quot; but here there&#39;s a tie for first and a tie for third. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that when there are ties, you still pick three, possibly including tied ones. But this complicates things. Maybe the problem assumes general positions where no three distances are equal, avoiding such ties. Let&#39;s assume that except at the center, flowers are in positions where there&#39;s a clear ordering of distances.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that for each flower, exactly three gardeners are the closest, which would require that no flower is equidistant to three or more gardeners. But in reality, on a grid, flowers along certain lines or points can be equidistant to multiple gardeners. For example, the perpendicular bisector between two gardeners is a line where points are equidistant to both. Similarly, the center is equidistant to all four.This is getting complicated. Maybe instead of getting bogged down in ties, we can proceed by considering regions where a gardener is definitely among the three nearest, regardless of ties.So, focusing on gardener (0,0). To be among the three nearest, (0,0) must not be the farthest. The farthest gardener from any flower in the square [0,1]x[0,1] is either (1,1), (1,0), or (0,1), depending on the flower&#39;s position.But generally, the opposite corner (1,1) is the farthest from (0,0) for flowers in the square. Wait, no. For a flower near (1,0), the farthest gardener would be (0,1). Similarly, for a flower near (0,1), the farthest would be (1,0). For a flower near the center, the farthest is (1,1). So, it&#39;s not always the opposite corner.Therefore, to determine when (0,0) is not the farthest, we need to compare d1² with the other three distances.Wait, to ensure that (0,0) is not the farthest, we need that there exists at least one gardener whose distance to the flower is greater than d1². So, if d1² is less than d2², d3², or d4², then (0,0) is not the farthest. But actually, to be among the three nearest, (0,0) just needs not to be the single farthest. But if there are multiple gardeners farther than (0,0), then (0,0) is in the three nearest.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. For any flower, we sort the four gardeners by distance. The three nearest are the first three in this sorted list. So, (0,0) will be included unless it is the farthest, i.e., the fourth in the sorted list. Therefore, the region where (0,0) is not the farthest gardener is the union of regions where d1² &lt; d4², d1² &lt; d3², and d1² &lt; d2². Wait, no. If (0,0) is not the farthest, then at least one of the other gardeners is farther. So, the condition is that d1² is not the maximum among d1², d2², d3², d4². Therefore, the region where d1² &lt; at least one of d2², d3², d4². But since there are three other gardeners, this is always true except when d1² is the maximum. So, the region where (0,0) is among the three nearest is the entire square except where d1² is the maximum.So, we need to find the area within the square where d1² is not the maximum. Which is equivalent to the area where at least one of d2², d3², or d4² is greater than d1².But let&#39;s find the locus where d1² equals the maximum of d2², d3², d4². The region where d1² is the maximum is the area where d1² ≥ d2², d1² ≥ d3², and d1² ≥ d4². The complement of this region is where (0,0) is not the farthest, hence included in the three nearest.So, let&#39;s find the boundaries where d1² = d2², d1² = d3², and d1² = d4².First, d1² = d2²:x² + y² = (1 - x)² + y²Simplify:x² = (1 - x)²x² = 1 - 2x + x²Cancel x²:0 = 1 - 2x =&gt; 2x = 1 =&gt; x = 0.5So, the vertical line x = 0.5 is where d1² = d2².Similarly, d1² = d3²:x² + y² = x² + (1 - y)²Simplify:y² = (1 - y)²y² = 1 - 2y + y²0 = 1 - 2y =&gt; 2y = 1 =&gt; y = 0.5So, the horizontal line y = 0.5 is where d1² = d3².Now, d1² = d4²:x² + y² = (1 - x)^2 + (1 - y)^2Expand:x² + y² = 1 - 2x + x² + 1 - 2y + y²Simplify:0 = 2 - 2x - 2y=&gt; 2x + 2y = 2=&gt; x + y = 1So, the line x + y = 1 is where d1² = d4².Therefore, the region where d1² is the maximum is where d1² ≥ d2², d1² ≥ d3², and d1² ≥ d4². Let&#39;s find the intersection of the regions defined by each inequality.1. d1² ≥ d2² =&gt; x² + y² ≥ (1 - x)² + y² =&gt; x ≥ 0.52. d1² ≥ d3² =&gt; x² + y² ≥ x² + (1 - y)² =&gt; y ≥ 0.53. d1² ≥ d4² =&gt; x² + y² ≥ (1 - x)² + (1 - y)² =&gt; x + y ≥ 1So, combining these three inequalities:x ≥ 0.5, y ≥ 0.5, and x + y ≥ 1.But x + y ≥ 1 is automatically satisfied if x ≥ 0.5 and y ≥ 0.5, since x + y ≥ 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. So, the region where d1² is the maximum is the intersection of x ≥ 0.5, y ≥ 0.5, which is the top-right quadrant of the square [0.5,1]x[0.5,1]. In this quadrant, the farthest gardener from any flower is (0,0), so (0,0) is excluded from the three nearest here.Therefore, the region where (0,0) is among the three nearest gardeners is the entire square except this top-right quadrant. But wait, in the rest of the square, (0,0) is not the farthest, so it&#39;s included in the three nearest.But wait, let&#39;s check this. Suppose we have a flower in the bottom-left quadrant of the square (x &lt; 0.5, y &lt; 0.5). Here, the distances to (0,0) would be smaller than to the other corners. So, (0,0) is the closest, followed by (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). So, the three nearest would be (0,0), (1,0), (0,1). So, (0,0) is included.If the flower is in the left half (x &lt; 0.5) but y &gt; 0.5, say x=0.3, y=0.6. Then:d1² = 0.09 + 0.36 = 0.45d2² = (0.7)^2 + 0.36 = 0.49 + 0.36 = 0.85d3² = 0.09 + (0.4)^2 = 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.25d4² = 0.49 + 0.16 = 0.65So, distances sorted: d3² (0.25) &lt; d1² (0.45) &lt; d4² (0.65) &lt; d2² (0.85)Thus, the three nearest are (0,1), (0,0), (1,1). So, (0,0) is included.Similarly, in the bottom half (y &lt; 0.5) but x &gt; 0.5, say x=0.6, y=0.3:d1² = 0.36 + 0.09 = 0.45d2² = 0.16 + 0.09 = 0.25d3² = 0.36 + 0.49 = 0.85d4² = 0.16 + 0.49 = 0.65Sorted: d2² (0.25) &lt; d1² (0.45) &lt; d4² (0.65) &lt; d3² (0.85)Three nearest: (1,0), (0,0), (1,1). So, (0,0) is included.In the top-right quadrant (x ≥ 0.5, y ≥ 0.5), say x=0.6, y=0.6:d1² = 0.36 + 0.36 = 0.72d2² = 0.16 + 0.36 = 0.52d3² = 0.36 + 0.16 = 0.52d4² = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32Sorted: d4² (0.32) &lt; d2² (0.52) = d3² (0.52) &lt; d1² (0.72)So, three nearest: (1,1), (1,0), (0,1). (0,0) is the farthest, so excluded.Therefore, the region where (0,0) is excluded is the top-right quadrant [0.5,1]x[0.5,1]. Hence, the flowers looked after by (0,0) are all flowers in the square except that quadrant.But wait, each square is adjacent to other squares. So, the gardener at (0,0) is also a vertex of the square to the left ([-1,0]x[0,1]) and below ([0,1]x[-1,0]). So, the region for gardener (0,0) would include parts from adjacent squares as well.Ah, right! Because the grid is infinite (or large), each gardener is at a vertex shared by four squares. So, to determine all flowers looked after by (0,0), we need to consider the four squares adjacent to (0,0): the square to the northeast [0,1]x[0,1], the square to the northwest [-1,0]x[0,1], the square to the southeast [0,1]x[-1,0], and the square to the southwest [-1,0]x[-1,0]. Wait, actually, each vertex is part of four squares, but depending on the grid&#39;s orientation. Let me clarify.Assuming the grid is standard with squares [i,i+1]x[j,j+1] for integers i,j. Then, the gardener at (0,0) is part of four squares: [0,1]x[0,1], [-1,0]x[0,1], [0,1]x[-1,0], and [-1,0]x[-1,0]. However, in each of these squares, the position of (0,0) is a corner, and we need to find in each square the region where (0,0) is among the three nearest gardeners.So, for each of the four squares adjacent to (0,0), we need to determine the region where (0,0) is in the top three nearest. For example, in the square [0,1]x[0,1], we already determined that the region is the entire square except [0.5,1]x[0.5,1]. Similarly, in the square [-1,0]x[0,1], which is to the left of (0,0), the gardener at (0,0) is the northeast corner of that square. So, in that square, the region where (0,0) is among the three nearest would be similar but mirrored.Let&#39;s analyze the square [-1,0]x[0,1]. In this square, the gardeners are at (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,0), and (0,1). A flower in this square at position (x,y) where -1 &lt; x &lt; 0 and 0 &lt; y &lt; 1 (assuming the square is from -1 to 0 in x and 0 to 1 in y). The distances to the four corners:d(-1,0)² = (x + 1)² + y²d(-1,1)² = (x + 1)² + (1 - y)²d(0,0)² = x² + y²d(0,1)² = x² + (1 - y)²We need to find the region where (0,0) is among the three nearest, i.e., where d(0,0)² is not the maximum of these four.Following similar logic as before, the region where d(0,0)² is the maximum would be where x ≥ -0.5, y ≥ 0.5, and x + y ≥ 0 (since the opposite corner here is (-1,1), so the line x + y = -1 + 1 = 0? Wait, no. Let&#39;s compute.To find where d(0,0)² is the maximum:d(0,0)² ≥ d(-1,0)² =&gt; x² + y² ≥ (x + 1)² + y² =&gt; x² ≥ x² + 2x + 1 =&gt; 0 ≥ 2x + 1 =&gt; x ≤ -0.5Similarly, d(0,0)² ≥ d(0,1)² =&gt; x² + y² ≥ x² + (1 - y)² =&gt; y² ≥ 1 - 2y + y² =&gt; 0 ≥ 1 - 2y =&gt; y ≤ 0.5And d(0,0)² ≥ d(-1,1)² =&gt; x² + y² ≥ (x + 1)² + (1 - y)²Expand:x² + y² ≥ x² + 2x + 1 + 1 - 2y + y²Simplify:0 ≥ 2x + 2 - 2y=&gt; 2y - 2x ≥ 2=&gt; y - x ≥ 1But in the square [-1,0]x[0,1], x ranges from -1 to 0, y from 0 to 1.So, y - x ≥ 1. Since x is negative, -x is positive. For example, if x = -1, y - (-1) = y + 1 ≥ 1 =&gt; y ≥ 0, which is always true. If x = 0, y - 0 ≥ 1 =&gt; y ≥ 1, but y ≤1, so y=1. So, the line y - x =1 in this square is y = x +1. When x=-1, y=0; when x=0, y=1. So, it&#39;s a diagonal from (-1,0) to (0,1). This line divides the square into two parts. The region where y - x ≥1 is above this line.Therefore, the region where d(0,0)² is the maximum in the square [-1,0]x[0,1] is the intersection of x ≤ -0.5, y ≤ 0.5, and y ≥ x +1.Wait, but x ≤ -0.5 and y ≤ 0.5, and y ≥ x +1. Let&#39;s see:For x ≤ -0.5, say x = -0.75, y needs to be ≥ -0.75 +1 = 0.25. But also y ≤0.5. So, in this case, y is between 0.25 and 0.5. Similarly, at x = -1, y ≥0. So, the region is a trapezoid from x=-1 to x=-0.5, bounded below by y = x +1 and above by y=0.5.Wait, this is getting complex. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern here. Each gardener&#39;s region consists of parts from the four adjacent squares, each part being the square minus the quadrant opposite to the gardener. In the square [0,1]x[0,1], the region for (0,0) is the square minus the top-right quadrant. Similarly, in the square [-1,0]x[0,1], the region for (0,0) would be the square minus the top-left quadrant (but mirrored). But I need to visualize this.Alternatively, considering symmetry, each gardener&#39;s region is a hexagon formed by the areas closer to them than to the opposite gardener in each adjacent square. But since we&#39;re selecting three nearest, not the closest, it&#39;s a different shape.Wait, maybe another approach. For a gardener at (0,0), the flowers they look after are those where (0,0) is one of the three nearest gardeners. This would include flowers in the adjacent squares where (0,0) is among the three closest.Considering the Voronoi regions for three nearest neighbors. This is more complex than the usual Voronoi diagram. There&#39;s a concept called k-th order Voronoi diagrams, where regions are defined as sets of points with the same k nearest neighbors. Here, k=3, but we need regions where a specific point is in the set of three nearest neighbors. This might form a certain shape.However, I might not need to get that technical. Let&#39;s think about the regions for (0,0):In each adjacent square, the region where (0,0) is in the top three nearest. As we saw in the square [0,1]x[0,1], it&#39;s the whole square except the top-right quadrant. Similarly, in the square [-1,0]x[0,1], it&#39;s the whole square except the top-left quadrant (the quadrant opposite to (0,0)). In the square [0,1]x[-1,0], it&#39;s the whole square except the bottom-right quadrant. And in the square [-1,0]x[-1,0], it&#39;s the whole square except the bottom-left quadrant.But wait, in each square adjacent to (0,0), the region where (0,0) is among the three nearest is three-quarters of the square. The quadrant opposite to (0,0) is excluded. Therefore, combining these regions from all four adjacent squares, the total area looked after by (0,0) would be four squares each contributing three-quarters, but overlapping at the edges. However, actually, each square is shared between four gardeners, so the regions from adjacent squares would form a shape around (0,0).But perhaps the complete region for (0,0) is a hexagon. Let me try to visualize:In the square [0,1]x[0,1], the region is three-quarters: the bottom-left, bottom-right, and top-left regions (excluding top-right). Similarly, in the square [-1,0]x[0,1], the region is three-quarters: bottom-left, top-left, and top-right (excluding bottom-right). In the square [0,1]x[-1,0], it&#39;s three-quarters: bottom-left, bottom-right, and top-right (excluding top-left). And in the square [-1,0]x[-1,0], it&#39;s three-quarters: top-left, top-right, bottom-right (excluding bottom-left). When combined, these regions around (0,0) form a shape that connects the three-quarters of each adjacent square.But when you put them together, what does that look like? Let&#39;s consider the boundaries.In the square [0,1]x[0,1], the excluded quadrant is top-right. The boundary is x=0.5 and y=0.5. Similarly, in the square [-1,0]x[0,1], the excluded quadrant is bottom-right, bounded by x=-0.5 and y=0.5. In the square [0,1]x[-1,0], the excluded quadrant is top-left, bounded by x=0.5 and y=-0.5. In the square [-1,0]x[-1,0], the excluded quadrant is top-right, bounded by x=-0.5 and y=-0.5.When combined, the region around (0,0) is bounded by the lines x=0.5, x=-0.5, y=0.5, y=-0.5, and the diagonals x + y = 0.5 and x - y = 0.5? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.Actually, the boundaries between the regions are where the gardener (0,0) is tied with another gardener for the third nearest. For example, the boundary where a flower is equidistant to (0,0) and another gardener, determining whether (0,0) is included or excluded.But maybe it&#39;s simpler to see that the region for (0,0) consists of the three-quarters of each adjacent square, which when connected, form a shape that is a square rotated by 45 degrees, or a diamond shape.Alternatively, consider the union of the three-quarter regions from each adjacent square. In each adjacent square, the excluded quadrant is the one opposite to (0,0). So, in the NE square ([0,1]x[0,1]), exclude NE quadrant; in the NW square ([-1,0]x[0,1]), exclude NW quadrant; in the SE square ([0,1]x[-1,0]), exclude SE quadrant; in the SW square ([-1,0]x[-1,0]), exclude SW quadrant. Wait, but (0,0) is a corner of each of these four squares. The excluded quadrant in each is the one diagonally opposite to (0,0). So, in each square, the excluded quadrant is the one farthest from (0,0).When you remove these excluded quadrants from each square, the remaining regions around (0,0) form a larger square rotated by 45 degrees, with its vertices at the centers of the original squares. Let&#39;s confirm.The centers of the original squares adjacent to (0,0) are at (0.5,0.5), (-0.5,0.5), (0.5,-0.5), and (-0.5,-0.5). If we connect these centers, we form a square rotated by 45 degrees, with side length √2. However, the regions we&#39;re describing are the areas within each original square up to their midlines (x=0.5, y=0.5, etc.). So, the boundary of the region for (0,0) would be formed by the lines x=0.5, x=-0.5, y=0.5, y=-0.5, and the diagonals x+y=0.5 and x-y=0.5, x+y=-0.5, x-y=-0.5. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, the region for (0,0) is bounded by the lines where the gardener (0,0) is about to be excluded, i.e., the boundaries of the excluded quadrants. In each adjacent square, the excluded quadrant is bounded by x=0.5 and y=0.5 (for the NE square), x=-0.5 and y=0.5 (for the NW square), x=0.5 and y=-0.5 (for the SE square), and x=-0.5 and y=-0.5 (for the SW square). The lines x=±0.5 and y=±0.5 form a larger square around (0,0), but that&#39;s not the case. Wait, no, those lines are the midlines of the original squares.But the actual region where (0,0) is included is each original square except the excluded quadrant. So, in each adjacent square, the region is a square with a corner removed. When combined, these regions form a shape around (0,0) that is an octagon? Let&#39;s think.In the NE square ([0,1]x[0,1]), the region is everything except the top-right quadrant ([0.5,1]x[0.5,1]). So, within this square, the boundary is x=0.5 and y=0.5. Similarly, in the NW square ([-1,0]x[0,1]), the region is everything except the top-left quadrant ([-1,-0.5]x[0.5,1]), bounded by x=-0.5 and y=0.5. In the SE square ([0,1]x[-1,0]), the region is everything except the bottom-right quadrant ([0.5,1]x[-1,-0.5]), bounded by x=0.5 and y=-0.5. In the SW square ([-1,0]x[-1,0]), the region is everything except the bottom-left quadrant ([-1,-0.5]x[-1,-0.5]), bounded by x=-0.5 and y=-0.5.When combined, these regions form a shape around (0,0) that is a square with its edges at the midlines of the original squares, connected by the remaining parts. However, the diagonals between these midlines are also boundaries. For example, between the NE and NW squares, the line y=0.5 from x=-0.5 to x=0.5. Similarly, the line x=0.5 from y=-0.5 to y=0.5, etc. But also, within each original square, the excluded quadrant is a corner, so the remaining region in each square is three-quarters, which includes the other three corners.But how does this look when combined? If we consider the union of all these regions, it&#39;s the area around (0,0) that is within 0.5 units in any direction, plus the areas beyond 0.5 units but not entering the excluded quadrants. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think of it this way:In each of the four adjacent squares, the region for (0,0) is three-quarters of the square. For example, in the NE square ([0,1]x[0,1]), the region is [0,0.5]x[0,1] union [0,1]x[0,0.5] minus the overlapping part. Wait, no. Actually, in the NE square, the excluded quadrant is [0.5,1]x[0.5,1], so the remaining region is the rest of the square. This includes:- The bottom half (y &lt; 0.5) of the square.- The left half (x &lt; 0.5) of the square.- The union of these two, which is all the square except the top-right quadrant.So, in the NE square, the region is all points where x &lt; 0.5 or y &lt; 0.5. This forms a shape that is the square minus the top-right quadrant.Similarly, in the NW square ([-1,0]x[0,1]), the region is all points where x &gt; -0.5 or y &lt; 0.5 (excluding the top-left quadrant).In the SE square ([0,1]x[-1,0]), the region is all points where x &lt; 0.5 or y &gt; -0.5 (excluding the bottom-right quadrant).In the SW square ([-1,0]x[-1,0]), the region is all points where x &gt; -0.5 or y &gt; -0.5 (excluding the bottom-left quadrant).When combined, these regions form an area around (0,0) that extends into each adjacent square up to their midlines (0.5 units away), but also includes parts beyond the midlines as long as they&#39;re not in the excluded quadrant. However, this seems like it would create a larger square around (0,0), but I need to visualize it better.Wait, let&#39;s consider the NE square&#39;s region: x &lt; 0.5 or y &lt; 0.5. So, in the NE square, the region includes everything to the left of x=0.5 and everything below y=0.5, which together cover all except the top-right quadrant. Similarly, in the SE square ([0,1]x[-1,0]), the region includes x &lt; 0.5 or y &gt; -0.5. Since y ranges from -1 to 0 in this square, y &gt; -0.5 is the upper half of this square. So, the region in the SE square is everything above y=-0.5 and everything left of x=0.5, which covers all except the bottom-right quadrant.Similarly for the other squares. Now, if we look at the union of all these regions around (0,0):- To the right (NE square): up to x=0.5, y can be anything except the top-right quadrant.- To the left (NW square): up to x=-0.5, y can be anything except the top-left quadrant.- Above (no square directly above, but considering the NW and NE squares): up to y=0.5.- Below (SE and SW squares): up to y=-0.5.But also, beyond these midlines, the regions extend into the adjacent squares as long as they&#39;re not in the excluded quadrants. For example, in the NE square, beyond x=0.5 is the excluded quadrant, but in the square to the east of NE square ([1,2]x[0,1]), the gardener (0,0) is not a vertex, so it&#39;s not considered. Wait, no. Each gardener&#39;s region is only determined by their adjacent squares. So, the region for (0,0) is only within the four adjacent squares: NE, NW, SE, SW. Beyond those, other gardeners take over.Therefore, combining the regions from the four adjacent squares, the total area looked after by (0,0) is the union of:1. NE square: x &lt; 0.5 or y &lt; 0.52. NW square: x &gt; -0.5 or y &lt; 0.53. SE square: x &lt; 0.5 or y &gt; -0.54. SW square: x &gt; -0.5 or y &gt; -0.5But this seems to cover all areas around (0,0) up to 0.5 units in each direction, and also parts beyond in the adjacent squares as long as they&#39;re not in the excluded quadrants. However, when you union these regions, you get a larger shape. Let&#39;s consider specific points.Take a point (0.6, 0.3). This is in the NE square. Since x=0.6 &gt; 0.5, but y=0.3 &lt; 0.5, it&#39;s included in the NE region. Similarly, a point (0.3, 0.6) is included because x=0.3 &lt; 0.5.A point (0.6, 0.6) is in the excluded quadrant of the NE square, so not included.A point (-0.6, 0.3) is in the NW square. Since x=-0.6 &lt; -0.5, but y=0.3 &lt; 0.5, so included in the NW region (x &gt; -0.5 or y &lt; 0.5). Wait, no. The NW square&#39;s region is x &gt; -0.5 or y &lt; 0.5. So, for (-0.6, 0.3), x=-0.6 is not &gt; -0.5, but y=0.3 &lt; 0.5, so it&#39;s included.Similarly, a point (-0.3, 0.6) in the NW square: x=-0.3 &gt; -0.5, so included regardless of y.A point (0.3, -0.6) in the SE square: y=-0.6 &lt; -0.5, but x=0.3 &lt; 0.5, so included.A point (-0.3, -0.6) in the SW square: x=-0.3 &gt; -0.5, so included.So, the region around (0,0) includes:- A central square from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5), because within this central area, all points are included in all four adjacent squares.- Plus extensions into each adjacent square beyond the central square, up to the edges of the original squares, but excluding the excluded quadrants.This forms a shape that is a square in the center, with four rectangular extensions along the axes, each extension being a rectangle from ±0.5 to ±1 in one axis, but limited by the excluded quadrants.However, the overlapping conditions (x &lt; 0.5 or y &lt; 0.5 in NE square) mean that the extensions are not simple rectangles. For example, in the NE square, the region beyond x=0.5 is allowed if y &lt; 0.5, forming a vertical strip from x=0.5 to 1 and y=0 to 0.5. Similarly, a horizontal strip from y=0.5 to 1 and x=0 to 0.5. But these strips overlap at the corner (0.5,0.5), which is excluded.Therefore, the total region for (0,0) is the central square plus four right triangles in each adjacent square. Wait, let&#39;s see:In the NE square, the region is:- The part where x &lt; 0.5 (a vertical rectangle from x=0 to 0.5, y=0 to 1)- The part where y &lt; 0.5 (a horizontal rectangle from x=0 to 1, y=0 to 0.5)The union of these two is the entire NE square except the top-right quadrant. This union forms a shape that is a rectangle from (0,0) to (0.5,1) union another rectangle from (0,0) to (1,0.5). The intersection of these two rectangles is the square from (0,0) to (0.5,0.5). So, the total region in the NE square for (0,0) is a combination of two rectangles, forming an L-shape.Similarly, in the NW, SE, and SW squares, the regions are also L-shaped. When combined with the central square (-0.5,-0.5) to (0.5,0.5), the total region becomes a larger square with each side having a midpoint extended outward, forming a shape known as a square octagon, or a square with its corners extended.Wait, but combining the central square and the four L-shaped regions from adjacent squares, the total shape would have the central square and four L-shapes, making a larger square with sides indented at the midpoints. Alternatively, it might form a hexagon.Wait, let&#39;s try to describe the boundary. Starting from the central square (-0.5,-0.5) to (0.5,0.5), and adding the L-shapes:- To the east: from x=0.5 to 1, y=0 to 0.5- To the north: y=0.5 to 1, x=0 to 0.5- To the west: x=-0.5 to -1, y=0 to 0.5- To the south: y=-0.5 to -1, x=0 to 0.5Wait, no. Actually, each L-shape is in a different direction. The NE L-shape extends east and north, but limited by the excluded quadrant. Wait, no. In the NE square, the L-shape is the union of x &lt; 0.5 and y &lt; 0.5, which covers the bottom half and left half of the NE square. So, the boundary of the region in the NE square is x=0.5 (from y=0 to 0.5) and y=0.5 (from x=0 to 0.5), forming a right angle at (0.5, 0.5), which is excluded.Similarly, the other regions have similar boundaries. So, when combined, the total region for (0,0) is bounded by:- East: x=0.5 from y=-0.5 to y=0.5- North: y=0.5 from x=-0.5 to x=0.5- West: x=-0.5 from y=-0.5 to y=0.5- South: y=-0.5 from x=-0.5 to x=0.5Plus the extensions beyond these lines into the adjacent squares:- Northeast: from (0.5,0.5) to (1,0) and (0,1)Wait, no. In the NE square, the region extends to x=1 and y=1, but only where x &lt; 0.5 or y &lt; 0.5. So, the boundary in the NE square is x=0.5 from y=0 to 0.5 and y=0.5 from x=0 to 0.5. Beyond that, in the NE square, the region continues to x=1 (but only y &lt; 0.5) and y=1 (but only x &lt; 0.5). So, the boundary includes the lines x=0.5 (from y=0 to 0.5) and y=0.5 (from x=0 to 0.5), and then extends to the edges of the NE square at x=1 and y=1, but only in the allowed regions.Therefore, the complete region for (0,0) is a central square plus four rectangles extending out in each cardinal direction, each rectangle being half of the original square&#39;s side. When connected, this forms a larger square with its edges at the midpoints of the original squares, connected by the extended rectangles. However, the corners of this larger square are missing because those areas are the excluded quadrants in the adjacent squares.Wait, actually, if you imagine the central square (-0.5,-0.5) to (0.5,0.5), and then attaching four rectangles:- To the east: from x=0.5 to 1, y=-0.5 to 0.5- To the north: y=0.5 to 1, x=-0.5 to 0.5- Similarly for west and south.But these rectangles are actually the parts of the adjacent squares where (0,0) is among the three nearest. However, in reality, these extensions are not full rectangles but half of them. For example, the eastern extension is only from x=0.5 to 1 and y=0 to 0.5 (not the full y range), because the region in the NE square is x &lt; 0.5 or y &lt; 0.5, so beyond x=0.5, y must be &lt; 0.5. Similarly, beyond y=0.5, x must be &lt; 0.5.Therefore, the total shape is a central square with four &#39;arms&#39; extending along the cardinal directions, each arm being a rectangle from ±0.5 to ±1 in one axis and ±0.5 in the other, but only half of that rectangle (up to the midline of the adjacent square). This creates a shape that looks like a plus sign (+) with a square in the center and arms extending halfway into each adjacent square.But also, in each diagonal direction (NE, NW, SE, SW), there are missing corners because those are the excluded quadrants. Therefore, the complete region is a convex polygon connecting the points (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), but only up to the midlines. Wait, but actually, the arms extend to the edges of the original squares (x=1, y=1, etc.), but limited by the excluded quadrants.Wait, no. The arms extend to the edges of the adjacent squares. For example, the eastern arm goes from x=0.5 to x=1 and y=-0.5 to y=0.5. But in reality, in the NE square, the eastern arm is from x=0.5 to x=1 and y=0 to y=0.5 (since y &lt; 0.5). Similarly, the northern arm is from y=0.5 to y=1 and x=-0.5 to x=0.5, but in the NW and NE squares, it&#39;s x &lt; 0.5 or x &gt; -0.5. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe a better approach is to consider the boundaries.The region for (0,0) is bounded by the following lines:- In the east: x=0.5 from y=-0.5 to y=0.5- In the north: y=0.5 from x=-0.5 to x=0.5- In the west: x=-0.5 from y=-0.5 to y=0.5- In the south: y=-0.5 from x=-0.5 to x=0.5Beyond these lines, the region extends into the adjacent squares but is bounded by the excluded quadrants. For example, east of x=0.5, the region is from y=0 to y=0.5 (not the full y range). Similarly, north of y=0.5, the region is from x=-0.5 to x=0.5. Therefore, the complete region is formed by connecting these boundary lines and the edges of the adjacent squares.This forms a convex polygon with eight sides: four along the midlines and four along the edges of the adjacent squares. Therefore, the shape is an octagon. Specifically, a regular octagon if the distances are uniform, but in this case, it&#39;s a rectangle extended by triangles or something similar.Wait, no. The east arm is a rectangle from x=0.5 to 1 and y=0 to 0.5. The north arm is a rectangle from y=0.5 to 1 and x=-0.5 to 0.5. Similarly for west and south. Connecting all these, the total region is a larger square centered at (0,0) with sides at x=±1 and y=±1, but with the corners removed. The corners removed are the excluded quadrants of the adjacent squares. For example, the NE corner (1,1) is excluded, the NW corner (-1,1) is excluded, etc.Therefore, the region is a square with side length 2 (from -1 to 1 in both x and y), but with each corner replaced by a quadrant (a square corner) removed. This forms a square with its corners cut off, making an octagon. The octagon&#39;s vertices are at the midpoints of the original square&#39;s sides: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), and the midpoints of the arms: (1,0.5), (0.5,1), (-0.5,1), (-1,0.5), (-1,-0.5), (-0.5,-1), (0.5,-1), (1,-0.5). Wait, no. Let me clarify.If the original squares have side length 1, then the region around (0,0) extends from -1 to 1 in both x and y, but with the corners beyond ±0.5 in both x and y removed. For example, the point (1,1) is excluded because it&#39;s in the excluded quadrant of the NE square. The region includes up to (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1), but not beyond. So, the vertices of the region are at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), and the midpoints (0.5,0.5), (-0.5,0.5), (-0.5,-0.5), (0.5,-0.5). Wait, but connecting these points would form a star-like shape, which doesn&#39;t make sense.Actually, no. The region for (0,0) includes:- The central square from (-0.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 0.5)- Four rectangles extending from the central square to the edges of the adjacent squares:  - East: from (0.5, -0.5) to (1, 0.5)  - North: from (-0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, 1)  - West: from (-1, -0.5) to (-0.5, 0.5)  - South: from (-0.5, -1) to (0.5, -0.5)But each of these rectangles is actually a trapezoid because they are bounded by the excluded quadrants. For example, the eastern rectangle is from x=0.5 to 1 and y=-0.5 to 0.5, but in reality, in the NE square, the region is x &lt; 0.5 or y &lt; 0.5, so beyond x=0.5, y must be &lt; 0.5. Similarly, beyond y=0.5, x must be &lt; 0.5. Therefore, the eastern extension is actually a right triangle with vertices at (0.5, -0.5), (1, -0.5), and (0.5, 0.5). Wait, no.Alternatively, the eastern arm is a rectangle from x=0.5 to 1 and y=0 to 0.5 (since in the NE square, y &lt; 0.5), and similarly from x=0.5 to 1 and y=0 to -0.5 in the SE square. Wait, but the SE square is [0,1]x[-1,0], so in that square, the region for (0,0) is x &lt; 0.5 or y &gt; -0.5. So, in the SE square, the eastern arm is x=0.5 to 1 and y=-0.5 to 0. But this overlaps with the NE square&#39;s eastern arm.This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to recognize that the region for each gardener is a regular hexagon centered at the gardener&#39;s position. In a grid of squares, the three nearest neighbors to a point would form a hexagonal pattern, similar to a honeycomb. This is because, in a square grid, the Voronoi cells for the three nearest neighbors would create a hexagonal tiling.Wait, but in a square grid, the usual Voronoi cells are squares. However, when considering three nearest neighbors, the regions might form hexagons. Let me think.If we consider the three nearest gardeners to a flower, in a square grid, depending on the flower&#39;s position, the three nearest could be three adjacent vertices. For example, a flower near the center of a square edge would have two gardeners from that edge and one from the adjacent edge. This might create a hexagonal pattern where each gardener&#39;s region is a hexagon.Yes, actually, this is similar to the hexagonal lattice Voronoi diagrams, but on a square grid. When considering the three nearest neighbors on a square grid, the regions around each gardener would form a hexagon. This is because, in areas between four gardeners, the three nearest would depend on the position, creating six regions around each gardener.Therefore, the final answer is that the region looked after by a single gardener is a regular hexagon centered at the gardener&#39;s position, with its vertices at the midpoints of the adjacent squares&#39; edges.To confirm this, consider that each gardener is surrounded by four other gardeners at the adjacent vertices. The three nearest gardeners to a flower would be the gardener in question and two of the adjacent gardeners, depending on the flower&#39;s position. The boundaries between these regions are the lines equidistant to three gardeners. This creates a hexagonal tiling pattern.Thus, drawing all the flowers looked after by one gardener would require shading a regular hexagon centered at the gardener&#39;s position, extending to the midpoints of the adjacent squares in all six directions (though on a square grid, it&#39;s actually four directions, but the three nearest neighbors create a hexagonal shape).However, based on our earlier analysis, the region is actually an octagon formed by the midlines and the edges of the adjacent squares. But the confusion arises because the three nearest neighbors can vary, and the intersection of these regions forms a hexagon.Wait, I need to reconcile this. Earlier analysis suggested an octagon, but hexagonal regions are common in three-neighbor Voronoi diagrams. Let&#39;s consider specific points.Take a gardener at (0,0). The flowers closest to (0,0) would be those in the central square. As we move away from (0,0), the next closest gardeners would be the adjacent ones: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1). Depending on the direction, the three nearest gardeners would be (0,0) and two of these adjacent gardeners.For example, moving along the positive x-axis towards (1,0), the three nearest gardeners to a flower near (0.5,0) would be (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1) or (0,-1). Wait, no. If the flower is at (0.5,0), the distances are:- (0,0): 0.5- (1,0): 0.5- (0,1): sqrt(0.25 + 1) ≈ 1.03- (0,-1): same as (0,1)So, the three nearest are (0,0), (1,0), and either (0,1) or (0,-1). But since (0,1) and (0,-1) are equidistant, the flower would be looked after by (0,0), (1,0), and both (0,1) and (0,-1) if there&#39;s a tie. However, the problem states three nearest, so perhaps only three are chosen, leading to ambiguity. To avoid this, the problem might assume general positions where no three distances are equal, but in reality, along the axes and diagonals, ties occur.This complexity suggests that the region for each gardener is a hexagon, as each gardener is part of three neighboring triplets, creating six sides. However, based on the earlier analysis of excluding quadrants in adjacent squares, the shape might be an octagon. There&#39;s a contradiction here.Let&#39;s refer back to the initial analysis. We determined that in each adjacent square, the region where the gardener is included is three-quarters of the square, excluding the quadrant opposite. When combined across four adjacent squares, this forms an octagon around the gardener.To resolve this, let&#39;s consider the boundaries. The boundaries where the gardener (0,0) is on the edge of being excluded or included are the midlines of the squares (x=±0.5, y=±0.5) and the diagonals (x+y=0.5, x-y=0.5, etc.). These lines form an octagon around (0,0).Specifically, the octagon&#39;s vertices are at the midpoints of the original squares&#39; edges: (0.5,0), (0,0.5), (-0.5,0), (0,-0.5), and the centers of the adjacent squares: (0.5,0.5), (-0.5,0.5), (-0.5,-0.5), (0.5,-0.5). However, the region is bounded by the midlines, so the octagon&#39;s vertices are at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (0.5,0.5), (-0.5,0.5), (-0.5,-0.5), (0.5,-0.5). But connecting these points forms a star, not an octagon.Wait, no. The boundaries are the lines x=0.5, y=0.5, x+y=1, etc. The intersection of these lines forms the octagon. For example, the line x=0.5 intersects y=0.5 at (0.5,0.5), which is excluded. But the actual vertices are where the boundaries meet the edges of the adjacent squares.For instance, in the NE square, the boundary is x=0.5 from y=0 to y=0.5 and y=0.5 from x=0 to x=0.5. These two lines meet at (0.5,0.5), which is excluded. Therefore, the boundary around (0,0) in the NE square is from (0.5,0) up to (0.5,0.5) and then left to (0,0.5). But since (0.5,0.5) is excluded, the boundary is actually two line segments: (0.5,0) to (0.5,0.5) and (0,0.5) to (0.5,0.5), but the point (0.5,0.5) itself is not part of the region.Therefore, the total boundary around (0,0) consists of eight line segments:1. From (0.5,0) to (0.5,0.5)2. From (0.5,0.5) to (0,0.5)3. From (0,0.5) to (-0.5,0.5)4. From (-0.5,0.5) to (-0.5,0)5. From (-0.5,0) to (-0.5,-0.5)6. From (-0.5,-0.5) to (0,-0.5)7. From (0,-0.5) to (0.5,-0.5)8. From (0.5,-0.5) to (0.5,0)But these segments are not connected because the points like (0.5,0.5) are excluded. Therefore, the actual boundary is made up of eight separate line segments, forming an octagon around (0,0).However, this seems to suggest that the region is an octagon. But when you actually plot this, the region looks like a square with its corners cut off at 45 degrees, forming an octagon. Each side of the octagon is a line from the midpoint of a square&#39;s edge to the midpoint of the adjacent square&#39;s edge.Yes, this makes sense. For example, starting from (0.5,0), moving diagonally up to (0.5,0.5), then left to (0,0.5), then diagonally up to (-0.5,0.5), and so on. However, these diagonals are actually the midlines of the original squares, so the octagon is rotated 45 degrees relative to the original grid.Therefore, the region looked after by a gardener is a regular octagon centered at the gardener&#39;s position, with vertices at the midpoints of the original squares&#39; edges and extending to the centers of the adjacent squares.This octagon can be described as the set of points where the maximum of |x|, |y| is less than or equal to 1, and the sum |x| + |y| is less than or equal to 1.5. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the octagon is formed by the intersection of the squares and the diamonds.But to describe it precisely, the octagon has eight sides: four along the axes at x=±1, y=±1, and four along the diagonals x±y=±1. However, given our earlier analysis, the actual boundaries are the midlines of the squares and the lines connecting them.In conclusion, after careful consideration and analysis, the region of flowers looked after by a single gardener is a regular octagon centered at the gardener&#39;s position, with its vertices located at the midpoints of the edges of the adjacent squares.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>✅:</span>To determine the flowers looked after by a specific gardener in a grid of squares with gardeners at each vertex, we analyze the regions where the gardener is among the three nearest. Here&#39;s the step-by-step solution:1. Grid Setup: Each square has gardeners at its four corners. For a gardener at a vertex, we consider the four adjacent squares sharing that vertex.2. Distance Analysis: For any flower within a square, the three nearest gardeners are determined by comparing distances to the four corners. A gardener is included if their distance isn&#39;t the farthest.3. Exclusion Regions: In each adjacent square, the region where the gardener is farthest (and thus excluded) is the quadrant diagonally opposite to them. Removing this quadrant leaves three-quarters of the square where the gardener is among the three nearest.4. Combining Regions: By combining the three-quarter regions from all four adjacent squares around the gardener, we form a shape. This shape is an octagon centered at the gardener&#39;s position, extending to the midpoints of the edges of the surrounding squares.Final Answer:The flowers looked after by one gardener form a regular octagon centered at the gardener&#39;s position. The octagon&#39;s vertices are at the midpoints of the edges of the four adjacent squares. This shape arises because each gardener tends to flowers within three-quarters of each adjacent square, excluding the diagonally opposite quadrant, resulting in an octagonal region.Visualization:- Draw a grid of squares with gardeners at each intersection.- Select a gardener and shade the three-quarters of each adjacent square closest to them, excluding the quadrant opposite.- The union of these shaded areas forms an octagon around the gardener.This octagon is symmetric and confirms that the gardener&#39;s responsible area is bounded by midlines of the grid squares, forming a geometric shape with eight sides.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e78c897></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e78c897><span class="icon" data-v-2e78c897>🔑:</span>Given the problem where the flower field consists of equal squares and each flower is taken care of by three nearest gardeners, where the gardeners live at the vertices of the squares, we need to determine the flowers that are taken care of by one of the gardeners.1. Consider the Arrangement of Squares:    - Visualize the field as a grid of squares (similar to a checkerboard pattern).    - Each square has vertices where gardeners live.2. Understand Flower Placement:    - Assume flowers are placed at the center of each square.    - Or flowers can also be placed such that each one is surrounded by four gardeners.3. Identify Flower Care by Gardeners:    - Each flower is taken care of by three nearest gardeners:        - For a flower located at the center of a square, the nearest gardeners would be diagonally adjacent vertices of that square.        - For a flower surrounded by four gardeners, the nearest ones can be three out of the four vertices of any adjoining squares based on proximity.4. Determine Specific Gardener&#39;s Responsibility:    - Let&#39;s pick a specific gardener residing at a vertex, say ((i, j)).    - The flower that the given gardener (at ((i, j))) is responsible for, will include:        - If the flower is slightly left below or right below (to share three closest gardeners including the gardener at ((i, j))).        - Detail placements:        - If gardener resides at ((i,j)), check cells that share the vertex ((i,j)).        - Depending on vertex sharing and distance, visualize splitting the contribution to surrounding cells.5. Graphical Representation:    - Draw a grid representing the field of squares.    - Mark the vertices with &quot;G&quot; where gardeners live.    - Highlight or mark the centers or areas where specific gardener&#39;s flowers fall based on proximity and allocation rules.6. Final Result Illustration:    - Highlight the specific flowers on the grid that are taken care of by the chosen gardener.    - Using this strategy, replicate the pattern to identify all similar arrangements across the grid.Given gardeners are equidistantly located and responsibility sharing is symmetric, repeating the logical step ensures all flower positions are covered under their care arrays.boxed{text{Illustrate and map out as described for specific gardener assignments accordingly}}</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-1127fd09><span data-v-1127fd09>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
