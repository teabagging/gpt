arrays. Cirno has prepared two arrays a and b, both consist of n non-negative integers. AquaMoon can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero):She chooses two indices i and j (1 le i, j le n), then decreases the i-th element of array a by 1, and increases the j-th element of array a by 1. The resulting values at i-th and j-th index of array a are a_i - 1 and a_j + 1, respectively. Each element of array a must be non-negative after each operation. If i = j this operation doesn&#39;t change the array a.AquaMoon wants to make some operations to make arrays a and b equal. Two arrays a and b are considered equal if and only if a_i = b_i for all 1 leq i leq n.Help AquaMoon to find a sequence of operations that will solve her problem or find, that it is impossible to make arrays a and b equal.Please note, that you don&#39;t have to minimize the number of operations.-----Input-----The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 leq t leq 100) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 leq n leq 100).The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, dots, a_n (0 leq a_i leq 100). The sum of all a_i does not exceed 100.The third line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, dots, b_n (0 leq b_i leq 100). The sum of all b_i does not exceed 100.-----Output-----For each test case print &quot;-1&quot; on the only line if it is impossible to make two arrays equal with some sequence of operations.Otherwise, print an integer m (0 leq m leq 100) in the first line — the number of operations. Then print m lines, each line consists of two integers i and j — the indices you choose for the operation.It can be proven that if it is possible to make two arrays equal with some sequence of operations, there exists a sequence with m leq 100.If there are multiple possible solutions, you can print any.-----Examples-----Input441 2 3 43 1 2 421 32 110054 3 2 1 00 1 2 3 4Output22 13 1-1061 41 41 51 52 52 5-----Note-----In the first example, we do the following operations:i = 2, j = 1: [1, 2, 3, 4] rightarrow [2, 1, 3, 4];i = 3, j = 1: [2, 1, 3, 4] rightarrow [3, 1, 2, 4];In the second example, it&#39;s impossible to make two arrays equal.</div><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>🧠:</span>Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let&#39;s read the problem statement carefully.So, the problem is about transforming array a into array b using certain operations. The allowed operation is to choose two indices i and j, decrease a_i by 1, and increase a_j by 1. Each operation must leave all elements non-negative. We need to find a sequence of such operations to make a equal to b, or determine that it&#39;s impossible.First, let&#39;s think about the conditions under which this is possible. The sum of the elements in a must equal the sum of the elements in b. Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible because each operation preserves the total sum (since you subtract 1 from one element and add 1 to another, the total sum remains the same). So, the first check is: sum(a) must equal sum(b). If not, output -1.Wait, but in the problem statement, the sum of a and b are given as not exceeding 100. So for each test case, if the sums of a and b are different, output -1.But there&#39;s another condition. Because each operation can only transfer 1 from i to j. So, the elements that need to be increased (b_i - a_i if a_i &lt; b_i) must be possible to get from the elements where a_i &gt; b_i (since those can give their excess). Let&#39;s think in terms of the differences between a and b.For each index i, calculate delta_i = a_i - b_i. The sum of all delta_i must be zero. Because sum(a) = sum(b) is a necessary condition, which is already checked. But for each element, the operation can transfer from a_i to a_j. However, after all operations, a must be equal to b. So, the deltas must have their positives and negatives such that the total sum is zero.Wait, but if sum(a) != sum(b), then it&#39;s impossible, which is the first check. So after passing that check, the sum of deltas (a_i - b_i) will be zero. But each delta_i can be positive (a_i has more than needed) or negative (a_i needs more). For the problem to be possible, the sum of positive deltas must equal the sum of negative deltas (since sum is zero). But that&#39;s already implied by the sum check. So the main check is sum(a) == sum(b). Because the sum of a and b must be the same. So the first step is to check if sum(a) != sum(b). If yes, output -1.But wait, no. Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose sum(a) equals sum(b), but for some index i, a_i &lt; b_i but there&#39;s no way to get the required amount from other elements. Wait, but since each operation can move from any i to j, as long as there is enough in the elements that have a_i &gt; b_i (so that their delta_i is positive) to cover the deficits in elements where delta_i is negative.Wait, for example, a = [3, 0], b = [1, 2]. Sum is 3 each. The deltas are 2 and -2. So possible. The required is to move 2 units from index 1 to 2. So two operations: (1,2) and (1,2). So possible.Another example: a = [2, 2], b = [3, 1]. Sum is 4 vs 4. Deltas are -1 and +1. So possible. So move 1 from index 2 to 1. So operation (2,1). But after that, a becomes [3,1], which is equal to b. So that works.So the key conditions are:1. sum(a) == sum(b).2. For each index i, after all operations, a_i must be exactly b_i. But during the operations, we can&#39;t have a_i go negative. So, during the process, when moving elements from i to j, the a_i must be sufficient. But the problem is that the order of operations might affect whether the a_i&#39;s stay non-negative.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t require the number of operations to be minimized, just to find any sequence (with up to 100 operations) that works. So perhaps the approach is to collect all the positions where a_i &gt; b_i (they need to give away their excess) and positions where a_i &lt; b_i (they need to receive). Then, for each excess, transfer 1 at a time to the deficits. But how to arrange the steps so that during each operation, the a_i being subtracted from doesn&#39;t go below zero.But perhaps there&#39;s a way to model this by first collecting the excess and deficit positions and then generating the steps.So the steps would be:For each test case:- Check if sum(a) != sum(b). If so, output -1.- Check if any a_i &lt; b_i and the sum of (b_i - a_i) over those i is not equal to the sum of (a_j - b_j) over j where a_j &gt; b_j. But since sum(a) = sum(b), these sums must be equal. So this is redundant.But even if sum(a) = sum(b), there&#39;s a possibility that the elements can&#39;t be arranged. For example, when n=1. If a_1 = b_1, then possible. Otherwise, even if sum(a) = sum(b), for n=1, it&#39;s impossible. Because the only possible operation is i=j, which does nothing. So, if a and b are different when n=1, output -1.Wait, let&#39;s think about that. For n=1, the only possible operations are (1,1), which do nothing. So, if a and b are not equal, even if their sum is same (which for n=1, sum(a) is a_1, sum(b) is b_1), then it&#39;s impossible.So, for n=1, the only possible solution is when a_1 == b_1. Otherwise, even if sum is same (which it has to be, because for n=1, sum(a) is a_1, sum(b) is b_1), but since a_1 != b_1, output -1.Ah! So the sum check is necessary but not sufficient. There&#39;s another condition: for each i, a_i &gt;= b_i if and only if the delta is positive. Wait no, that&#39;s not the case. For example, in the first example, the output is possible. Let&#39;s see:Test case 1:n=4a = [1,2,3,4]b = [3,1,2,4]sum(a) = 1+2+3+4 = 10, sum(b) = 3+1+2+4 = 10.The deltas are:a_i - b_i: 1-3 = -2 (so needs +2)2-1 = +1 (excess 1)3-2 = +1 (excess 1)4-4 = 0.So total excess is 1+1 = 2. Total deficit is 2. So sum matches. So possible.In the second test case:n=2a = [1,3] sum 4.b = [2,1] sum 3. So sum is different. So output -1. Which matches the sample.Third test case: n=1, a is 0, b is 0. So possible. Output 0 operations.Fourth test case: a is [4,3,2,1,0], sum 4+3+2+1+0 =10. b is [0,1,2,3,4], sum 10.So the deltas for each position:0:4-0=4 (excess)1:3-1=2 (excess)2:2-2=0.3:1-3= -2 (deficit)4:0-4= -4 (deficit)So the excess is 4+2=6. The deficit is 2+4=6. So possible. The sample output shows 6 operations.So in this case, the steps involve moving from the excess positions (indices 1 and 2) to deficit positions (3,4,5).Now, how to model the steps.The approach is:For each test case where possible (sum equals and n=1 implies a1==b1, etc.), collect the indices that have a_i &gt; b_i (excess) and those that have a_i &lt; b_i (deficit).Then, for each excess index, we need to transfer (a_i - b_i) units to the deficit indices.But the problem is that each operation can move 1 unit from any excess to any deficit. So, for example, for a deficit of 2 in index j, we can have two operations from i to j.But the order of operations must not cause any a_i to go negative. So during the process, when we subtract 1 from a_i (excess index), the remaining a_i must still be &gt;=0.Wait, but the way the operations are applied, each operation subtracts 1 from a_i and adds 1 to a_j. So during the process, a_i must be &gt;=0 after each operation.But initially, a is given as the input. Then, during the operations, each a_i must not drop below zero.So for example, if we have an excess in index i. The initial a_i is a_i_initial. After each operation that takes from i, a_i decreases by 1. So, after k operations from i, a_i_initial - k &gt;= 0.But since the required number of transfers from i is (a_i_initial - b_i), which is the excess, the total operations from i is exactly (a_i_initial - b_i). Because each transfer is one unit. So, as long as (a_i_initial - (number of transfers from i)) &gt;= b_i. But since the required number of transfers from i is (a_i_initial - b_i), then after all transfers, a_i would be a_i_initial - (number of transfers from i) = b_i.But during the process, after each transfer, the a_i must be &gt;=0. So for example, if a_i_initial is 5, and we need to transfer 5 units. Then, each time we transfer 1 unit, the a_i decreases by 1. So after the first transfer, a_i is 4, which is &gt;=0. So this is okay.Wait, but since the initial a is given, and the required number of transfers from i is (a_i_initial - b_i), which is the excess. So during the entire process, the a_i starts at a_i_initial and is decremented by 1 each time it is used as the source. So after each operation, a_i is a_i_initial - (number of times it&#39;s been used as source so far). So during the process, as long as the number of times i is used as a source doesn&#39;t exceed (a_i_initial - b_i), then the final a_i will be correct, and during the process, a_i will be &gt;= b_i + (excess - number of transfers from i) ?Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think: For i, initial a_i is a_i. We need to perform (a_i - b_i) transfers from i. Each transfer reduces a_i by 1. So after k transfers from i, a_i is a_i -k. But after all (a_i - b_i) transfers, a_i becomes a_i - (a_i - b_i) = b_i.But during the process, for each transfer from i, the a_i after the operation is (a_i -k) &gt;=0, where k is the number of transfers done so far.But when you start with a_i, and you need to do (a_i - b_i) transfers. So during the first transfer, a_i becomes a_i -1. For the second, a_i -2, and so on. So, after m transfers from i, a_i is a_i - m. But m can be up to (a_i - b_i). So the minimal a_i during the process is a_i - (a_i - b_i) = b_i. But since after all operations, the array becomes equal to b, which has non-negative elements. So if all b_i are non-negative (as per the problem statement, yes), then during the process, when the transfers are done, the a_i (after each operation) must not drop below zero. However, the problem states that each element must be non-negative after each operation.Wait, but the problem says that after each operation, all elements must be non-negative. So during the transfers, the a_i (source) must be &gt;=0 after the operation.Wait, the operation is: decrease a_i by 1, then increase a_j by 1. So the source i must have a_i &gt;=1 before the operation. Because after the operation, a_i becomes a_i -1, which must be &gt;=0. So a_i must be &gt;=1 before the operation. Therefore, when generating the sequence of operations, we must ensure that when we choose i as the source, that a_i &gt;=1 at that moment.But the initial a is given, and the sequence of operations must be such that each step is valid. So how can we generate a sequence of operations that satisfies this?This complicates things because the order of operations matters. For example, if we have two excess positions i and j, and we take from i first until it&#39;s exhausted, then take from j. But perhaps in some cases, this is not possible.But given that the problem allows any valid sequence (without minimal steps), perhaps the approach is to first process the excess positions in a way that they can always provide the required units.Wait, perhaps we can model this by first gathering all the excess positions (those with a_i &gt; b_i) and deficit positions (those with a_i &lt; b_i). Then, for each excess position, we generate as many operations as needed (excess) by moving from that position to each deficit position, in a way that after each operation, the source&#39;s a_i is still &gt;=0.But how to arrange the steps.Alternative idea:We can generate a list of all the required moves. For each excess position i, collect the amount of excess (e_i = a_i - b_i). For each deficit position j, collect the amount of deficit (d_j = b_j - a_j). Then, for each excess i, we need to transfer e_i units from i to various j&#39;s. Similarly, for each deficit j, need to receive d_j units from various i&#39;s.So, for example, for the first test case:Excess positions: 2 (e=1), 3 (e=1). Deficit positions: 1 (d=2).So for each of the two excess positions, we can transfer their 1 unit each to position 1.So two operations: 2→1 and 3→1.In the sample output, that&#39;s exactly what is done.So how to model this.We can create two lists:sources: list of (i, e_i) where e_i is the number of times we need to take from i.destinations: list of (j, d_j) where d_j is the number of times to send to j.Then, we can iterate through the sources and destinations, and for each source, distribute their e_i to the destinations until all are covered.For example:For each source i with e_i &gt;0:   for each destination j in destinations:      take the minimum of e_i and d_j.      add min(e_i, d_j) operations from i to j.      subtract that amount from e_i and d_j.      if e_i becomes zero, break.This way, each source&#39;s excess is distributed to the destinations.But how to manage this in code, and generate the steps.But the problem is that in code, the a array is modified after each operation. So when we generate the sequence of operations, the actual a_i and a_j values must be such that after each operation, a_i &gt;=0.But perhaps since the initial a_i is &gt;= b_i (for sources), and the steps are moving exactly (a_i -b_i) units from i, then as long as we take the steps in a way that each step from i comes before any steps that would require a_i to be lower than necessary.Wait, perhaps if the sources are processed in such a way that all their required transfers are done in sequence. For example, for a source i with e_i = 5, we can generate 5 operations from i to j, but j can be varying.But during these operations, the a_i would decrease by 1 each time. So after the first operation, a_i is a_i_initial -1. After the second, a_i_initial -2, etc. But since a_i_initial is b_i + e_i, and e_i is the amount to be transferred, then after each operation, a_i_initial -k &gt;= b_i, so a_i_initial -k &gt;=0 since b_i &gt;=0.Wait, because a_i_initial is the initial value, which is a_i. So e_i = a_i - b_i. So during the process of moving e_i units from i to j, the a_i will decrease by 1 each step. The initial a_i is b_i + e_i. So after k steps, a_i is (b_i + e_i) -k. Since e_i is the total steps from i, the final a_i will be b_i. But during the steps, for each step, the a_i is (b_i + e_i) - (k-1), where k-1 is the number of steps taken so far. So during the first step, a_i is (b_i + e_i) - 0 = b_i + e_i -0 = a_i_initial. Then subtract 1, so after step 1, a_i is a_i_initial -1. But since e_i is a_i_initial -b_i, a_i_initial -1 = (b_i + e_i) -1 = b_i + (e_i -1). Since e_i is &gt;=1 (since this is a source), e_i -1 &gt;=0, so a_i_initial -1 &gt;= b_i. But after all steps, a_i_initial - e_i = b_i.So during the steps, after each step, a_i is (b_i + e_i) - k, where k is the number of steps taken from i so far. Since k &lt;= e_i, then (b_i + e_i -k) &gt;= (b_i + e_i) - e_i = b_i &gt;=0. So as long as we process all steps from i before any steps that might use i as a destination, it&#39;s safe.Wait, but if i is a source, then during the steps, we are only moving from i. So i can&#39;t be a destination in these steps. So the a_i is only being decreased. Since the initial a_i is &gt;= b_i, and each step subtracts 1, then a_i after each step is &gt;= b_i &gt;=0. So it&#39;s safe.So the approach would be:- For each test case where possible (sum(a) == sum(b), and for n=1, a[0] == b[0]):   collect all sources (i where a[i] &gt; b[i]).   collect all destinations (j where a[j] &lt; b[j]).   For each source i, e_i = a[i] - b[i].   For each destination j, d_j = b[j] - a[j].   Then, generate a list of operations that for each source i, sends e_i units to the destinations. For each destination j, the amount received is d_j.   So, for each source i in sources:      remaining = e_i      for each destination j in destinations:          if d_j == 0:              continue          count = min(remaining, d_j)          for _ in range(count):              add operation (i+1, j+1) (since the problem uses 1-based indices)          remaining -= count          d_j -= count          if remaining == 0:              break   So this way, each source&#39;s excess is distributed to the destinations in sequence.   But this approach may not work if the destinations are processed in an order that leaves some steps impossible. But according to the reasoning above, since the steps are moving from the sources to the destinations, and each step from i to j is allowed (since a_i is sufficient), then this approach should work.Wait, but how can we be sure that during the steps, the a_i (source) is always &gt;=1 when used?For example, suppose a source i has e_i = 3. So the initial a_i is b_i +3. We need to move 3 units from i. Each time we move 1 unit, the a_i decreases by 1. So after moving k units, a_i is (b_i +3) -k. So for the first move, a_i is (b_i +3) -0 (before subtract) then becomes (b_i+3) -1. But as long as k &lt;=3, (b_i+3) -k &gt;=0. Since b_i is &gt;=0, (b_i+3) -k &gt;=0. But since k can be up to 3, (b_i+3) -3 = b_i &gt;=0. So yes.So this approach is safe. Because each source is only used to give away their excess, and the steps are arranged to take exactly e_i steps from i, so the a_i will not go below zero.Therefore, the algorithm is:For each test case:1. Check if sum(a) != sum(b) → output -1.2. If n=1, check if a[0] == b[0]. If not, output -1. Else, output 0 operations.3. Else, check for each element if a_i can be adjusted to b_i. For this, since sum is same, the delta for each i must satisfy that when moving the excesses to deficits, it&#39;s possible. But how?Wait, no. For n&gt;1, even if sum is same, but some a_i &lt; b_i and no other a_j &gt; b_j, then it&#39;s impossible. But sum(a) = sum(b), so if any a_i &lt; b_i, there must be some a_j &gt; b_j. So it&#39;s possible.So for n&gt;1, after sum check, proceed.Then, collect all sources (a_i &gt; b_i) and destinations (a_i &lt; b_i).Then, generate the operations by distributing each source&#39;s excess to the destinations in any order, making sure to fill each destination&#39;s deficit as much as possible.So code steps:Read t test cases.For each test case:Read n.Read a as a list.Read b as a list.Check sum(a) == sum(b). If not, output -1.If n ==1:   if a[0] == b[0], output 0.   else, output -1.Else:   check if for any i, a[i] &lt; b[i]. But since sum is same, there must be some j where a[j] &gt; b[j].   So proceed.   Collect sources (i where a[i] &gt; b[i]) → each gives (a[i] - b[i]) units.   Collect destinations (i where a[i] &lt; b[i]) → each needs (b[i] - a[i]) units.   Now, generate the operations.   Initialize a list of operations.   For each source in sources:      current_i = source index (0-based?)      amount_to_give = a[current_i] - b[current_i]      while amount_to_give &gt;0:          for each destination in destinations:              current_j = destination index              needed = b[current_j] - a[current_j]              if needed ==0:                  continue              # how much can we take from current_i to current_j              take = min(amount_to_give, needed)              for _ in range(take):                  operations.append( (current_i +1, current_j +1) )              amount_to_give -= take              b[current_j] -= take  # since we have given &#39;take&#39; units, the needed is reduced by &#39;take&#39;              # wait, no. Wait, the destinations&#39; needed is stored in a separate structure.              # perhaps, we need to track the remaining needed for each destination.              # So maybe create a list of deficits, where each deficit is (j, d_j), and d_j is the remaining needed.              # Then, for each source, process the deficits in order, taking as much as possible.   Wait, perhaps the better approach is to create a list of deficits. For example, for each j where a[j] &lt; b[j], the deficit is d_j = b[j] - a[j]. So for each j, we need to receive d_j.   So, let&#39;s create a list called deficits, which is a list of (j, d_j) for all j with d_j &gt;0.   Then, for each source i, with e_i = a[i] - b[i], we can distribute e_i units to the deficits.   So for each source i in sources:      e = e_i      while e &gt;0:          for each (j, d) in deficits:              if d ==0:                  continue              transfer = min(e, d)              for _ in range(transfer):                  operations.append( (i+1, j+1) )              e -= transfer              d -= transfer              # update the deficit&#39;s d value.              # since the list is being processed, perhaps replace the tuple (j, d) with (j, d - transfer)              # but tuples are immutable. So perhaps use a list and track the remaining deficits.   So perhaps the deficits are stored as a list where each element is [j, remaining], and we iterate through this list, subtracting as needed.   So code steps:   Initialize deficits = [ (j, b[j] - a[j]) for j in 0..n-1 if a[j] &lt; b[j] ]   For each i in sources (where a[i] &gt; b[i]):      e = a[i] - b[i]      while e &gt;0:          for j in range(len(deficits)):              j_idx, needed = deficits[j]              if needed ==0:                  continue              transfer = min(e, needed)              # add transfer operations from i+1 to j_idx+1              for _ in range(transfer):                  operations.append( (i+1, j_idx+1) )              e -= transfer              needed -= transfer              deficits[j] = (j_idx, needed)              if e ==0:                  break   So in this way, each source&#39;s excess is distributed to the deficits in the order of the deficits list.   However, once a deficit is filled (needed becomes zero), it&#39;s skipped in subsequent iterations.   This approach should work.   Let&#39;s test this logic with the sample input.   Sample Input 1:   4   Test case 1:   n=4   a = [1,2,3,4]   b = [3,1,2,4]   sum is 10.   sum is same. n&gt;1.   sources:   i=1 (a[1]=2, b[1]=1 → e=1)   i=2 (a[2]=3, b[2]=2 → e=1)   deficits: j=0 (b[0]-a[0] =3-1=2), j=1 (a[1] is 2, b[1] is1 → no deficit. j=0 is index 0. j=1 in the a array is 2, which is not a deficit. So deficits are [ (0,2) ]   So for source i=1 (0-based?), no. Wait, the a array is [1,2,3,4], indices 0,1,2,3.   So sources are:   i=1 (a[1] =2, b[1]=1 → e=1).   i=2 (a[2]=3, b[2]=2 → e=1).   deficits are j=0 (d=3-1=2).   So processing source i=1 (0-based? Or 1-based?) Wait, in code, we process 0-based indices.   So for i=1 (a[1]=2, e=1):   e=1.   iterate through deficits list:   first deficit is j=0, needed=2.   transfer min(1,2)=1.   add 1 operation (i+1=2, j+1=1) → (2,1).   e becomes 0. Break.   So source i=1&#39;s e is handled.   Then process source i=2 (e=1):   deficits list now is [(0,1)].   transfer min(1,1)=1.   add 1 operation (3 →1). So (3,1).   e becomes 0.   So operations are [(2,1), (3,1)] → which matches the sample output.   Correct.   Another test case: sample 4.   Input:   5   4 3 2 1 0   b:0 1 2 3 4   a = [4,3,2,1,0]   b = [0,1,2,3,4]   sum a: 4+3+2+1+0=10. sum b: 0+1+2+3+4=10. Ok.   sources: indices where a[i] &gt; b[i]:   i=0:4&gt;0 → e=4.   i=1:3&gt;1 → e=2.   i=2:2=2 → no.   i=3:1&lt;3 → no.   i=4:0 &lt;4 → no.   So sources are i=0 (e=4), i=1 (e=2).   deficits are indices where a[i] &lt; b[i]:   j=3:3-1=2 → d=2.   j=4:4-0=4 → d=4.   So deficits list is [(3,2), (4,4)].   Processing source i=0 (e=4):   e=4.   iterate through deficits:   first deficit (3,2). transfer min(4,2)=2. add 2 operations (1 →4 (since i+1 is 0+1=1, j+1=3+1=4? Wait, j is 3 in 0-based? Yes.   So j=3 → j+1 is 4.   So two operations: (1,4) and (1,4).   Then e becomes 4-2=2.   Next deficit is (4,4) (j=4 in 0-based, j+1=5). So transfer min(2,4)=2. add two operations (1,5).   Now e is 0. So for source i=0, we have 2+2=4 operations.   Then process source i=1 (e=2).   Deficits list now has:   (3,0) and (4,2). Because after processing source 0:   j=3&#39;s d was 2, subtracted 2 → 0.   j=4&#39;s d was 4, subtracted 2 → 4-2=2? Wait, no.   Wait, after processing source i=0:   the first deficit is j=3, d=2. transfer 2 → d becomes 0. So deficits becomes [ (3,0), (4,4) ].   Then, the next deficit is j=4, d=4. transfer min(2,4)=2. So after this, j=4&#39;s d becomes 4-2=2.   So the deficits list becomes [ (3,0), (4,2) ].   Now processing source i=1 (e=2).   Iterate through deficits:   first is j=3, d=0 → skip.   next is j=4, d=2. transfer min(2,2)=2. add two operations (2,5) (since i+1 is 1+1=2, j+1=4+1=5).   So two operations: (2,5) ×2.   Now e becomes 0.   So total operations are 2+2+2=6, which matches the sample.   So the code approach seems correct.   So the steps are:   For each test case where possible:   - collect sources (i, e_i) where e_i = a[i] - b[i].   - collect deficits (j, d_j) where d_j = b[j] - a[j].   Then for each source in sources:      process the deficits in order, sending as much as possible from the source to each deficit until the source&#39;s excess is zero.   The order in which the deficits are processed can affect the sequence of operations, but any valid sequence is acceptable.   So the code should generate the correct steps.   Now, to code this.   The code steps:   Read t test cases.   For each test case:      read n.      read a as list.      read b as list.      sum_a = sum(a)      sum_b = sum(b)      if sum_a != sum_b:          print(-1)          continue      if n ==1:          if a[0] == b[0]:              print(0)          else:              print(-1)          continue      # check if a == b.      # but even if not, proceed to check if possible.      # for n&gt;1:      # collect sources and deficits.      sources = []      deficits = []      possible = True      for i in range(n):          ai = a[i]          bi = b[i]          if ai &gt; bi:              sources.append( (i, ai - bi) )          elif ai &lt; bi:              deficits.append( (i, bi - ai) )      # now, process the sources and deficits.      operations = []      # create a list of deficits, which will be modified as we process.      # since tuples are immutable, we&#39;ll use a list of lists or a list of objects.      # convert deficits to a list of lists for easy modification.      # convert each deficit to a list [j, remaining]      deficits = [ [j, d] for j, d in deficits ]      for (i, e) in sources:          # process this source&#39;s excess e.          while e &gt;0:              # iterate through the deficits.              for j in range(len(deficits)):                  deficit_j = deficits[j]                  j_idx, needed = deficit_j                  if needed ==0:                      continue                  # determine how much to transfer.                  transfer = min(e, needed)                  # add &#39;transfer&#39; operations from i+1 to j_idx+1.                  for _ in range(transfer):                      operations.append( (i+1, j_idx+1) )                  # update e and the deficit&#39;s needed.                  e -= transfer                  deficit_j[1] -= transfer                  if e ==0:                      break              # once all deficits are processed, e should be zero.              # because sum of sources equals sum of deficits.      # after processing all sources, check if all deficits are filled.      # sum of remaining deficits should be zero.      # but according to the initial sum check, this should be ensured.      # so proceed.      # output the operations.      print(len(operations))      for op in operations:          print(op[0], op[1])   Now, let&#39;s test this code with the sample input.   Sample Input 1:   4   Test case 1:   n=4   a = [1,2,3,4]   b = [3,1,2,4]   sources: i=1 (e=1), i=2 (e=1).   deficits: j=0 (d=2).   Processing sources:   For i=1 (e=1):      deficits is [[0,2]].      transfer min(1,2) →1.      add operation (2,1) (since i+1=1+1=2, j_idx+1=0+1=1).      e becomes 0.   For i=2 (e=1):      deficits is now [[0,1]] (since 2-1=1).      transfer 1 → add operation (3,1).      e becomes 0.   So operations are 2, which matches sample.   Sample Test case 4:   sources are i=0 (e=4), i=1 (e=2).   deficits are j=3 (d=2), j=4 (d=4).   Processing i=0:   e=4.   first deficit j=3, d=2. transfer 2 → e=2.   deficit j=3 becomes 0.   next deficit j=4, d=4 → transfer 2 → e=0.   deficit j=4 becomes 4-2=2.   So operations added are 2*(1→4) and 2*(1→5).   Then, processing i=1 (e=2):   deficit list has j=3 (d=0), j=4 (d=2).   So process j=4. transfer 2 → operations 2*(2→5).   Total operations 6.   Which matches the sample.   Now, the code should handle all cases correctly.   Edge case: when n=1. For example, a=0 and b=0 → output 0. Otherwise, output -1.   Another edge case: when a and b are already equal. Then, no operations needed.   For example, test case 3 in the sample: output 0.   So the code checks if a == b after the sum check and n&gt;1.   Wait, no. Because in the code, for n&gt;1, even if a == b, the code will proceed to check sources and deficits, which would be empty. So sources and deficits would be empty. The code would generate zero operations, which is correct.   So in code, after collecting sources and deficits, if sources is empty, then there are no operations. Which is correct.   So for a test case where a equals b, the code would output 0 operations.   So this handles that case.   Another case: a and b are already equal. Sum is same, n&gt;1 → output 0.   So code works.   Now, let&#39;s code this.   Also, note that the code should read the input from stdin, process each test case, and output the required steps.   So the code would be:   Read t.   for _ in range(t):       n = int(input())       a = list(map(int, input().split()))       b = list(map(int, input().split()))       sum_a = sum(a)       sum_b = sum(b)       if sum_a != sum_b:           print(-1)           continue       if n ==1:           if a[0] == b[0]:               print(0)           else:               print(-1)           continue       sources = []       deficits = []       for i in range(n):           ai = a[i]           bi = b[i]           if ai &gt; bi:               sources.append( (i, ai - bi) )           elif ai &lt; bi:               deficits.append( [i, bi - ai] )  # stored as list for mutability       operations = []       for (i, e) in sources:           current_e = e           while current_e &gt;0:               for j in range(len(deficits)):                   deficit = deficits[j]                   j_idx, needed = deficit                   if needed ==0:                       continue                   transfer = min(current_e, needed)                   for _ in range(transfer):                       operations.append( (i+1, j_idx+1) )                   current_e -= transfer                   deficit[1] -= transfer                   if current_e ==0:                       break               # end for j       print(len(operations))       for op in operations:           print(op[0], op[1])   Now, let&#39;s test this code with the sample input.   Sample Input 2:   2   1 3   2 1   sum_a=4, sum_b=3. So sum different → output -1.   Sample Input 3:   1   0   0 → sum is same. n=1, a[0] == b[0]. Output 0.   All samples should be handled correctly.   Now, code seems correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can transform array `a` into array `b` using a series of operations where we decrement an element of `a` and increment another element. If it is possible, we must provide the sequence of operations; otherwise, we return `-1`. Approach1. Sum Check: First, check if the sums of arrays `a` and `b` are equal. If they are not, transformation is impossible.2. Single Element Check: For a single-element array, check if the elements are already equal.3. Excess and Deficit Identification: For each element in `a` and `b`, identify indices where `a` has excess elements (values greater than `b`) and where `a` has deficits (values less than `b`).4. Operation Generation: For each excess element, generate operations to transfer the excess to deficit elements until all deficits are resolved.

Sum Check: The sum of elements in `a` and `b` must be equal for a transformation to be possible. If they are not, we immediately return `-1`.2. Single Element Handling: For a single-element array, the only valid transformation is if the elements are already equal.3. Excess and Deficit Tracking: We track indices where `a` has excess elements (elements greater than corresponding `b` elements) and where `a` has deficits (elements less than corresponding `b` elements).4. Transfer Operations: For each excess element, we generate operations to transfer the excess to the deficit elements. This is done by iterating through the deficits and transferring as much as possible from the current excess element to each deficit until all deficits are resolved.This approach ensures that we efficiently generate the required operations while maintaining the constraints that each element of `a` remains non-negative after each operation.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-6d2bec23 data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review" data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review-title" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>❓:</span>Happy Ladybugs is a board game having the following properties:The board is represented by a string, boldsymbol{b}, of length n.

Let&#39;s think about the problem step by step.First, let&#39;s understand when the ladybugs are happy. Each ladybug must have at least one adjacent ladybug of the same color. But after moving them, the arrangement must satisfy this condition for all.So, the input is a string representing the board. The underscores are empty cells. We can move any ladybug to any empty cell in any number of moves. The goal is to check if there&#39;s a possible arrangement where all ladybugs are happy.Hmm. Let&#39;s consider some scenarios.Case 1: If there is at least one ladybug of a color that has only one occurrence. Then, it&#39;s impossible because that ladybug can&#39;t have any adjacent same color. So, in this case, the answer is NO.Wait, but what if there are two or more of the same color? For example, if there&#39;s exactly two of color &#39;A&#39;, can they be placed adjacent to each other? Yes. But if there&#39;s only one, it&#39;s impossible.So first, I need to check that for every color (not underscore), the count is at least two. If any color appears exactly once, return NO.But wait, what about the case where there are no underscores? Then, the current arrangement must already have all ladybugs happy. Because if there&#39;s no empty cell, you can&#39;t move any ladybug. So you have to check if the existing arrangement is already happy.So the steps I need to take are:1. Check if there&#39;s any ladybug color that occurs exactly once. If yes, return NO.2. If there are underscores (i.e., empty cells), then the answer depends on two things:   a. Are there at least two of each color?   b. If yes, then we can arrange them in groups by moving them into empty cells. For example, group all same colors together. So, as long as each color has at least two, and there&#39;s at least one empty cell, we can arrange them properly.Wait, but how? Because when there&#39;s an underscore, you can move ladybugs. So as long as each color has at least two, you can rearrange all of them into adjacent positions. But you need to have enough empty cells to do that. Wait, but the number of empty cells might not matter as long as you can move the ladybugs. Because moving allows you to place any ladybug into any empty spot. So perhaps the presence of at least one empty cell is sufficient to allow rearrangement. Or maybe not.Wait, maybe the key here is that if there&#39;s at least one empty cell, then you can rearrange the ladybugs into a configuration where all same colors are grouped together. For example, you can arrange all &#39;A&#39;s first, then &#39;B&#39;s, etc., with the underscores possibly in between. But each group of same colors must have length &gt;=2.Wait, no. Because even if you have two &#39;A&#39;s and two &#39;B&#39;s, you can arrange them as AAB B. Wait, but each &#39;B&#39; would need to be adjacent. So perhaps the arrangement would be AABBB (but in that case, all are adjacent except the middle B, but maybe I&#39;m not thinking clearly.Alternatively, perhaps when there&#39;s at least one empty cell, you can arrange the same colors into contiguous blocks. For example, if we have multiple underscores, then for each color, we can make a contiguous block. So for each color with count &gt;=2, arrange them together. Since there&#39;s at least one empty cell, we can split the colors into separate groups, each being contiguous. Because the empty cells allow us to move the ladybugs into positions where same colors are grouped. So as long as each color occurs at least two times, the answer is YES, provided there&#39;s at least one underscore.Wait, but what about when there&#39;s no underscores? Then, the current arrangement must already be happy. Because you can&#39;t move any ladybugs. So for the case with no underscores:Check if the current arrangement is already happy. For each ladybug, check if it has at least one neighbor (left or right) of the same color.For example, if the input is &quot;AABBC&quot;, then check each position:Indices 0: &#39;A&#39; has neighbor 1 (A) → happy.Index 1: same as 0 → happy.Index 2: &#39;B&#39; has neighbor 3 (B) → happy.Index 3: same as 2 → happy.Index 4: &#39;C&#39; has no neighbor same → not happy. So the answer is NO.But in the sample input 1, the first test case is 5 AABBC, which returns NO. Because the C is single.So, in summary, the algorithm steps are:For a given string b:1. Count the frequency of each character, except underscore.   - If any character (other than _) has a frequency of exactly 1 → return NO.2. Check if there&#39;s at least one underscore.   a. If there is at least one underscore:      - Then, as long as all characters with count &gt;=1 have count &gt;=2, then return YES.   b. Else (no underscores):      - Check if the current arrangement is already happy.      - For each position in the string:         i. If the current character is underscore, skip.         ii. Check if either left or right neighbor is same as current.         iii. If any character fails this, return NO.      - If all pass, return YES.So that&#39;s the plan.Now, let&#39;s test this logic against the sample inputs.Sample Input 0:Sample 1:Input is 7 RBY_YBRLet&#39;s parse this.Original string: R B Y _ Y B RWait, the sample input says after moving the rightmost B and R, becomes YYRRBB__.But in the original, there are two Y&#39;s, two B&#39;s, two R&#39;s.Wait, but in the original, R occurs once, B occurs once, Y occurs once? Wait no:Original string: R B Y _ Y B R.So count for R: 2 (first and last character), B: 2 (positions 1 and 5?), Y: 2 (positions 2 and 4). So each color has at least two.There is an underscore. So according to the logic, as all counts are &gt;=2, answer is YES. Which matches the sample.Sample 0&#39;s second input:6 X_Y__X → X, Y, X. So count X: 2, Y:1. So Y has count 1 → return NO. Which matches sample output.Third input is 2 __ → no ladybugs. So all ladybugs (none) are happy. So return YES.Fourth input: 6 B_RRBR → the string is B _ R R B R.Count B: 2 (positions 0 and 4?), R: 3 (positions 2,3,5). So R has three. So all counts are &gt;=2. There is an underscore. So answer is YES.Sample Output 0 is YES, NO, YES, YES. Which matches the sample.Sample Input 1:First case: 5 AABBC. No underscores. So check if all are happy.A A B B C.The C is alone. So answer is NO. Which matches the sample.Second case:7 AABBC_C → underscores. All counts: A:2, B:2, C:2. So YES.Third case: 1 _ → no ladybugs → YES.Fourth case: 10 DD__FQ_QQF → check counts. D:2, F:2, Q:3. So yes, since all counts &gt;=2 (for F: 2, Q:3). So with underscores, return YES.Fifth case:6 AABCBC → no underscores. Check each position.A at 0: next is A → happy.A at 1: left A → happy.B at 2: next is C. Left is A. So not same. So B is unhappy. So answer NO.So the logic works.Now, implementing this in Python.The steps for the code:Read g games.For each game:Read n (but n is the length of the string, which is given, but perhaps redundant since the string&#39;s length is n).Read the string b.Process as follows:First, count the frequencies of each character except &#39;_&#39;.If any character (other than &#39;_&#39;) has count 1 → return &#39;NO&#39;.Else, check if there are any underscores.If there are underscores:   return &#39;YES&#39; (since all colors have at least two, and we can rearrange via the underscores).Else:   Check if the current arrangement is already happy.   For each position i in the string:      if b[i] is &#39;_&#39; → skip.      else:          left = i-1 if i&gt;0 else -1          right = i+1 if i &lt; len(b)-1 else -1          if (left &gt;=0 and b[left] == b[i]) or (right &gt;=0 and b[right] == b[i]) → OK.          else → return &#39;NO&#39;.   If all positions are OK → return &#39;YES&#39;.So code outline:def happyLadybugs(b):    from collections import Counter    cnt = Counter(b)    # Check for single ladybugs    for key in cnt:        if key != &#39;_&#39; and cnt[key] == 1:            return &#39;NO&#39;    # Check if there&#39;s any underscore    if &#39;_&#39; in cnt:        # All ladybugs can be rearranged        return &#39;YES&#39;    else:        # No underscores; check current arrangement        for i in range(len(b)):            if i ==0:                if b[i] != b[i+1]:                    return &#39;NO&#39;            elif i == len(b)-1:                if b[i] != b[i-1]:                    return &#39;NO&#39;            else:                if b[i] != b[i-1] and b[i] != b[i+1]:                    return &#39;NO&#39;        return &#39;YES&#39;Wait, but in the case where the string is length 1 and no underscores, then it&#39;s a single ladybug which must return NO. But since in the code, when there&#39;s no underscores, the loop runs. For example, if len(b) is 1 and the character is &#39;A&#39;. Then, the code enters the else block. The loop runs for i=0. Then, i ==0 and len(b)-1 is 0. So check if i is 0 and len(b)-1 ==i. So in that case, if i==0 and len(b) is 1, then code checks if b[0] == b[i+1], but i+1 is 1 which is out of bounds. Wait, code has:for i in 0 to len(b)-1:   if i ==0:      if b[0] != b[1] → but when len(b) is 1, this is out of index.Wait, this code will fail for len(b) 1 with no underscores. Because in that case, the loop runs for i=0. Then, checks if i ==0 and i == len(b)-1 (which is 0). So in that case, code would check if b[0] == b[i-1], but i-1 is -1. So perhaps the code&#39;s logic is incorrect.Ah, right. So in the code&#39;s else block (no underscores), the code checks each position. Let&#39;s think about how to handle the edges.Wait, in the code:if there are no underscores, we need to check that for each ladybug, either the left or right neighbor is same.So for each i in 0 to len(b)-1:   current_char = b[i]   left = i-1 &gt;=0 ? b[i-1] : None   right = i+1 &lt; len(b) ? b[i+1] : None   if current_char is not left and not right → return &#39;NO&#39;So code:for i in range(len(b)):    left_ok = (i &gt; 0 and b[i-1] == b[i])    right_ok = (i &lt; len(b)-1 and b[i+1] == b[i])    if not (left_ok or right_ok):        return &#39;NO&#39;return &#39;YES&#39;This is better. So in the code, for each position, check if left or right is same.So for example, in a single character (like &#39;A&#39;), then i=0. i&gt;0 is False, i &lt; len(b)-1 is 0 &lt;0 → False. So left_ok and right_ok are both False. Then, not (False or False) → True → return &#39;NO&#39;.Which is correct.So code in the else block should be:for i in range(len(b)):    current = b[i]    has_left = (i &gt; 0) and (b[i-1] == current)    has_right = (i &lt; len(b)-1) and (b[i+1] == current)    if not (has_left or has_right):        return &#39;NO&#39;return &#39;YES&#39;Yes. That&#39;s better.So the code can be written as:def happyLadybugs(b):    from collections import Counter    counts = Counter(b)    # Check for single ladybugs    for char, count in counts.items():        if char != &#39;_&#39; and count == 1:            return &#39;NO&#39;    # Check if there are underscores    if &#39;_&#39; in counts:        return &#39;YES&#39;    else:        # Check if all are already happy        for i in range(len(b)):            current = b[i]            # Check left and right            left = (i &gt; 0 and b[i-1] == current)            right = (i &lt; len(b)-1 and b[i+1] == current)            if not (left or right):                return &#39;NO&#39;        return &#39;YES&#39;Yes, that should handle all cases.Now, testing the sample inputs:Sample Input 0:Case 1: &quot;YYR_B_BR&quot;Counts: Y: 2, R: 2, B: 2, _:1.All counts &gt;=2 for ladybugs. So return YES.Sample Input 0:Second case: X_Y__X → X: 2, Y:1 → returns NO.Third case: __ → counts has only &#39;_&#39;. Since the code checks for counts of characters other than &#39;_&#39;, but in this case, there are no ladybugs. So for loop in the code will not find any characters with count 1. So code proceeds.Then, &#39;_&#39; is in counts → returns YES. Which is correct.Fourth case: B_RRBR → counts: B: 2, R:3, _:1. So returns YES.Sample Input 1:First case: AABBC → no underscores. Check each position:Indices 0: A has next A → ok.1: A has prev → ok.2: B has next B → ok.3: B has prev → ok.4: C has no neighbors. So code returns NO.Second case: AABBC_C → counts have underscores. So returns YES.Third case: &#39;_&#39; → counts has only &#39;_&#39;. So code returns YES (since no ladybugs).Fourth case: DD__FQ_QQF → counts for D:2, F:2, Q:3. So returns YES.Fifth case: AABCBC → no underscores. Check each position:Positions 0: A. next is A → ok.1: A. prev is A → ok.2: B. next is C → no. prev is A. So not adjacent same → returns NO.So code returns NO. Correct.Thus, the code should handle all cases.Now, to write the code as a function that reads from stdin.The input format is:Read g.For each of g test cases:Read n (but n can be ignored as the next line is a string of length n).Read the string.So, in Python:Read g.For _ in range(g):    n = int(input().strip())    b = input().strip()    print(happyLadybugs(b))Thus, the code should be:But need to make sure that the function is called after being defined.So, putting it all together:import sysfrom collections import Counterdef happyLadybugs(b):    counts = Counter(b)    # Check for single occurrence of any ladybug    for char, count in counts.items():        if char != &#39;_&#39; and count == 1:            return &quot;NO&quot;    # Check if there are underscores    if &#39;_&#39; in counts:        return &quot;YES&quot;    else:        # Check if all are already happy        for i in range(len(b)):            current = b[i]            left = i &gt; 0 and b[i-1] == current            right = i &lt; len(b)-1 and b[i+1] == current            if not (left or right):                return &quot;NO&quot;        return &quot;YES&quot;if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    g = int(sys.stdin.readline())    for _ in range(g):        n = int(sys.stdin.readline())        b = sys.stdin.readline().strip()        print(happyLadybugs(b))This should handle all cases correctly.Let me check the sample input 0:Sample Input 0:47RBY_YBR → the code checks counts. R:2, B:2, Y:2, _:1. All counts &gt;=2 → returns YES.6X_Y__X → X:2, Y:1 → returns NO.2__ → counts has only _, returns YES.6B_RRBR → B:2, R:3, _:1 → returns YES. Which matches sample output.Sample Input 1:55AABBC → no underscores. The code checks each position. C has no neighbors. Returns NO.7AABBC_C → has underscore, all counts &gt;=2 → YES.1_ → returns YES.10DD__FQ_QQF → has underscore, counts for D:2, F:2, Q:3 → YES.6AABCBC → no underscores. Check each position. At index 2 (B), left is A, right is C. So not adjacent same → returns NO.Which matches the sample outputs.Thus, the code should be correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if all ladybugs on a board can be made happy through a series of moves. A ladybug is happy if it has at least one adjacent ladybug of the same color. The solution involves checking specific conditions to determine if such an arrangement is possible. Approach1. Check for Single Ladybugs: If any ladybug color appears exactly once, it&#39;s impossible to make that ladybug happy. Thus, the answer is immediately &quot;NO&quot;.2. Check for Empty Cells (Underscores): If there are empty cells, we can rearrange the ladybugs. As long as each color appears at least twice, we can always rearrange them to make all ladybugs happy, so the answer is &quot;YES&quot;.3. No Empty Cells: If there are no empty cells, we need to check the current arrangement. Each ladybug must already have an adjacent ladybug of the same color. If any ladybug does not meet this condition, the answer is &quot;NO&quot;. Solution Code```pythonimport sysfrom collections import Counterdef happyLadybugs(b):    counts = Counter(b)    # Check for any ladybug with a single occurrence    for char, count in counts.items():        if char != &#39;_&#39; and count == 1:            return &quot;NO&quot;    # Check if there are underscores allowing rearrangement    if &#39;_&#39; in counts:        return &quot;YES&quot;    else:        # Check if the current arrangement is already happy        for i in range(len(b)):            current = b[i]            left_ok = (i &gt; 0 and b[i-1] == current)            right_ok = (i &lt; len(b) - 1 and b[i+1] == current)            if not (left_ok or right_ok):                return &quot;NO&quot;        return &quot;YES&quot;if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    g = int(sys.stdin.readline())    for _ in range(g):        n = int(sys.stdin.readline())        b = sys.stdin.readline().strip()        print(happyLadybugs(b))``` Explanation1. Single Ladybug Check: We use a counter to check if any ladybug color appears exactly once. If so, return &quot;NO&quot;.2. Empty Cells Check: If there are empty cells (underscores), we can rearrange the ladybugs, so return &quot;YES&quot; provided all colors have at least two ladybugs.3. Current Arrangement Check: If no empty cells exist, we verify each ladybug has an adjacent same-color neighbor. If all do, return &quot;YES&quot;; otherwise, &quot;NO&quot;.This approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine if all ladybugs can be made happy, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-6d2bec23 data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review" data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review-title" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>❓:</span>Chef has an array A of length N.In one operation, Chef can choose any [subsequence] of the array and any integer X and then add X to all the elements of the chosen subsequence.Determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array distinct.------ Input Format ------ - The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the length of Array A.- Next line contains N space-separated integers A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, dots, A_{N} - denoting the array A.------ Output Format ------ For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements distinct.------ Constraints ------ 1 ≤ T ≤ 40001 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}- Sum of N over all test cases do not exceed 3 cdot 10^{5}----- Sample Input 1 ------ 433 3 361 3 2 1 2 241 2 1 251 3 2 4 6----- Sample Output 1 ------ 2210----- explanation 1 ------ Test case 1:- Operation 1: Choose the subsequence {A_{1}} and add X = 1 to the elements.

The problem is to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of an array distinct. Each operation allows us to choose any subsequence and add any integer X to all elements of that subsequence. Hmm.Wait, a subsequence here means any subset of elements, right? Not necessarily contiguous. So in each operation, we can pick any subset of elements and add the same X to each of them. But X can vary between operations, right? Like, each operation has its own X.The goal is to make all elements distinct with as few operations as possible. Let&#39;s think about how to approach this.First, let&#39;s consider the case when all elements are already distinct. Then the answer is 0, which is straightforward.But when there are duplicates, we need to find a way to adjust the elements. The key is to model how the operations can resolve these duplicates.Let me take sample input 1, test case 1: 3 3 3. The output is 2. Explanation uses two operations, each changing one element. But why can&#39;t we do it in one operation?Because in one operation, you can add X to a subset. For example, maybe add 1 to the first two elements, but then they become 4 and 4, which are duplicates. So you need to adjust each duplicate in a way that they don&#39;t collide.Wait, but in the sample explanation for test case 1, they add 1 to the first element, then 2 to the second. So after two operations, all are distinct. But why can&#39;t they do it in one operation by adding different Xs? No, because in each operation, the X is fixed for all elements in the subsequence. So each operation adds the same X to all chosen elements.So the problem is to assign different increments to the elements such that after some operations, each element is unique. The challenge is to find the minimal number of steps where each step is a choice of X and a subset of elements to add X to.Wait, but how do the operations affect the elements? Let&#39;s model the elements as starting with their initial values. Each operation allows us to add any X to any subset of elements. So after k operations, each element&#39;s value is its initial value plus the sum of X&#39;s for the operations in which it was included.So the final value of each element is A_i + sum of X&#39;s from the operations where it was chosen. The sum can vary per element, depending on how many times they were included in the subsequences and the X&#39;s chosen each time.But the key is that each X can be different per operation, but the same for all elements in the subset during that operation.So the problem reduces to finding a set of X&#39;s (one per operation) and assignments (which elements are in each operation&#39;s subset) such that all final elements are distinct. And we need the minimal number of operations possible.Hmm, how to model this. Let&#39;s think of the problem in terms of the differences between elements. For duplicates, their initial values are the same. So the sum of X&#39;s applied to each must be different. Let&#39;s denote for each element i, let&#39;s say the total sum of X&#39;s applied to it is S_i. Then, for duplicates (elements with the same A_i), their S_i must be unique.So the problem becomes, for each group of elements with the same initial value, assign S_i&#39;s such that all S_i&#39;s in the group are distinct. Also, the S_i&#39;s for each element can be expressed as a sum of a subset of the X&#39;s chosen in each operation. Wait, no. Because each X is applied in a particular operation. So the sum S_i is the sum of X_j for each operation j where element i was in the subsequence.So the S_i&#39;s are determined by which operations the element was part of, and the X&#39;s chosen for each operation.But how to model the minimal number of operations required. Let&#39;s think about the frequencies of the elements.Suppose a value v occurs m times. Then, all these m elements must have distinct S_i&#39;s. Since their A_i is the same, the S_i must form a set of m distinct numbers. Then the problem becomes, for each group of duplicates (frequency m &gt;=2), how to assign their S_i&#39;s such that the S_i&#39;s are distinct, and the way they are assigned can be represented as a sum over a certain number of operations, each with their own X and chosen subsets.The key observation is that the minimal number of operations needed is equal to the maximum number of bits needed to represent the differences between S_i&#39;s in each group.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s similar to binary representations. For example, for a group of m elements, each needs a unique S_i. The minimal number of operations is the minimal k such that 2^k &gt;= m. Because with each operation, you can assign a bit (0 or 1) to whether an element is in the subset (so each operation contributes X_j multiplied by 0 or 1, depending on inclusion). Then, the sum S_i would be the sum of X_j * b_ij, where b_ij is 0 or 1. So to get m distinct S_i&#39;s, you need to have k such that the number of possible unique combinations is at least m.But wait, but the X&#39;s can be any integers. So perhaps you can choose the X&#39;s such that each is a power of 2, allowing binary-like combinations. For example, if you use X_1=1, X_2=2, X_3=4, etc. Then each element&#39;s S_i is the sum of some subset of these X&#39;s. Each subset gives a unique sum, so for m elements, you need log2(m) operations (ceiling). But this is only if m is a power of two. Otherwise, ceiling(log2(m))).But in the sample input 1, test case 1, there are 3 duplicates. So log2(3) is ~1.58, so ceiling is 2. Which matches the sample output. Similarly, in test case 3, the array has two pairs of duplicates. For each pair, the required operations would be ceiling(log2(2))=1. But since there are two pairs, perhaps the maximum is 1. But sample 3&#39;s output is 1. So that&#39;s correct.So the approach would be:For each value in the array, count its frequency. For each frequency m &gt;=2, compute the required number of operations as the ceiling of log2(m). Then, the minimal total number of operations needed is the maximum of these required operations across all values.Wait, but sample test case 2: the input is [1,3,2,1,2,2]. The frequencies are:1: 22: 33: 1So for 1: requires ceil(log2(2))=1. For 2: ceil(log2(3))=2. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.Similarly, test case 3: array is [1,2,1,2]. Frequencies are 2 for each 1 and 2. Both require 1 operation. So maximum is 1. Which matches the sample.So this approach seems to align with the samples.But why does this approach work? Let&#39;s think.Each operation can be thought of as a bit in the binary representation. For each group, the required number of bits (operations) is the number needed to represent m unique values. Each operation&#39;s X is chosen as a power of 2 (like 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.), so that each bit position corresponds to a different operation. Then, for each element in the group, the subset of operations it&#39;s included in (the bits set to 1) forms a unique binary number, ensuring that their S_i&#39;s are all distinct. Since each X is a power of 2, the sum of their X&#39;s will be unique.For example, in a group of 3 elements:X1=1, X2=2.The three elements can be included in:- X1 only: sum=1- X2 only: sum=2- X1 and X2: sum=3.Wait, that gives 3 unique sums, which is sufficient. So with 2 operations, you can handle m=3. Which aligns with ceil(log2(3))=2.So this seems correct.Thus, the minimal number of operations required is equal to the maximum number of operations needed for any individual group. For each group, the required number is the minimal k such that 2^k &gt;= m, where m is the frequency of that group. So the answer is the maximum of ceil(log2(m)) across all groups. If the array has all unique elements, the answer is 0.So the steps to solve the problem are:1. For each test case, count the frequency of each element.2. For each frequency m (&gt;=2), compute k = floor(log2(m-1)) +1. Because 2^k &gt;= m. For example, m=3: 2^2=4 &gt;=3, so k=2.3. Find the maximum k across all frequencies.That&#39;s the answer.But wait, let&#39;s test this logic against the samples.Sample test case 1: frequency is 3. So log2(3) is ~1.58, ceil is 2. Correct.Sample test case 3: frequency 2. log2(2) is 1, ceil is 1. Correct.Sample test case 2: frequency 3. ceil(log2(3))=2.Another example: if a group has frequency 4, then ceil(log2(4))=2 (since 2^2=4). So that&#39;s correct.Wait, but 4 elements: you can assign sums 0,1,2,3. Which can be represented with 2 bits. So that&#39;s correct.So the formula for k is ceiling of log2(m).But how to compute that? For m &gt;=1, k is the number of bits needed to represent m-1 in binary, i.e., the position of the highest set bit plus one.For example, m=3: m-1=2 (binary 10), highest set bit is 2^1, so k=2.Alternatively, in Python, we can compute it as (m-1).bit_length().Because for m=3, (3-1).bit_length() is 2, which is correct.Yes. So for any m &gt;=1, the required k is (m-1).bit_length().Because:For m=1: (1-1).bit_length() is 0. But m=1 is a frequency, but since we need all elements distinct, frequencies of 1 don&#39;t contribute to the operations. So, in code, we process m &gt;=2.Wait, for example, when m=1, the required k is 0, but since m is 1, it&#39;s not part of the problem. So for m&gt;=2, the required k is (m-1).bit_length().So the approach is to compute for each frequency m &gt;=2 the (m-1).bit_length(), then take the maximum over all such values.Wait, let&#39;s check:m=2: (2-1).bit_length()=1. So k=1. Correct.m=3: 2.bit_length()=2. Correct.m=4: 3.bit_length()=2 (since 3 is 11 in binary). So 2, but 2^2=4. So yes, 4 elements can be handled with 2 operations.Wait, m=4: each element can have a unique sum of 0,1,2,3 (binary 00,01,10,11). So 2 operations. Correct.So yes, the required k for a group of size m is (m-1).bit_length().Thus, the algorithm becomes:For each test case:- Count the frequencies of each element.- For each frequency m, compute (m-1).bit_length() if m &gt;=2.- Take the maximum of these values across all frequencies. If no frequencies (all unique), answer is 0.So the code would be:Read T test cases.For each test case:Read N, then read the array A.Compute the frequency counts (using a dictionary or Counter).For each frequency m in the frequency counts.values():   if m &gt;=2:       compute k = (m-1).bit_length()       keep track of the maximum k.The answer is the maximum k found, or 0 if none.So, for example, in sample test case 3:The array is [1,2,1,2]. The frequencies are 2 and 2.For each, (2-1).bit_length() is 1. So maximum is 1. Correct.Sample test case 2:Frequencies 2,3. For 2: 1, for 3: 2. Max is 2.Sample test case 1: 3. 3-1=2, bit_length is 2. So answer is 2.Sample test case 4: all frequencies 1. So answer is 0.This seems to work.So the code can be written as follows.But wait, how to handle the frequencies correctly?In Python, the code would be:Read T.For each T:   Read N.   Read the array A as a list of integers.   Create a frequency dictionary, e.g., using collections.Counter.   max_ops = 0   for count in Counter.values():       if count &gt;=2:           ops = (count-1).bit_length()           if ops &gt; max_ops:               max_ops = ops   print(max_ops)Yes.Testing this against the samples:Sample 1:Test case 1: count is 3. (3-1).bit_length() is 2. So max_ops=2. Correct.Sample test case 3: counts are 2 and 2. Both give 1. Max is 1.Sample test case 2: counts are 2 and 3. 3 gives 2. So correct.Sample test case4: all counts 1. So 0.Yes.So this code should work.But wait, let&#39;s test for m=4: (4-1).bit_length() is 3. Wait, 3 in binary is 11, which is 2 bits. Oh wait, 3.bit_length() is 2, but (4-1) is 3, which is 11 (binary), so (3).bit_length() is 2. Wait, but 2^2 is 4, which is equal to 4. So for m=4, the required operations is 2. But according to (m-1).bit_length(), it&#39;s 2. So that&#39;s correct.Wait, for m=4, 4 elements. So (4-1).bit_length() is 2. Because 3 is 11, which is 2 bits. So the code gives 2, which is correct.Yes, because 2^2=4 &gt;=4.So the code is correct.So this approach should work.So the final Python code is:Read T, loop over T test cases. For each, read N, read array, count frequencies, compute max (count-1).bit_length() for counts &gt;=2.So the code would be as follows.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of an array distinct. Each operation allows us to choose any subsequence of the array and add an integer X to all elements of that subsequence. Approach1. Frequency Analysis: For each test case, count the frequency of each element in the array.2. Determine Operations: For each element with a frequency greater than 1, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all occurrences of that element distinct. This is done using the bit length of the frequency minus one, which gives the number of bits needed to represent all distinct values.3. Result Calculation: The result for each test case is the maximum number of operations required for any element in the array. Solution Code```pythonimport sysfrom collections import Counterdef main():    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    ptr = 0    T = int(input[ptr])    ptr += 1    for _ in range(T):        N = int(input[ptr])        ptr += 1        A = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+N]))        ptr += N        freq = Counter(A)        max_ops = 0        for count in freq.values():            if count &gt;= 2:                ops = (count - 1).bit_length()                if ops &gt; max_ops:                    max_ops = ops        print(max_ops)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation1. Reading Input: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.2. Frequency Counting: Using the `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each element in the array.3. Operations Calculation: For each element with a frequency greater than 1, we determine the number of operations required using `(count - 1).bit_length()`. This method calculates the number of bits needed to represent `count - 1`, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed to make all occurrences distinct.4. Result Output: The maximum number of operations required for any element is printed as the result for each test case.This approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we minimize the number of operations by leveraging bit manipulation to determine the optimal number of steps needed.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-6d2bec23 data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review" data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review-title" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>❓:</span>Given an array A of size N.

Hmm. Let&#39;s think about how to approach this.Wait, the problem says that the arrays can contain duplicates. Oh right, so maybe some elements are repeated. But even then, B is missing one occurrence of an element compared to A. So how to track that?The straightforward approach would be to calculate the sum of all elements in A and subtract the sum of B. The difference would be the missing number. That works when there are no duplicates, but wait, even with duplicates, as long as the sum approach counts all occurrences. Because if in A an element appears k times, and in B it appears k-1 times, then the sum difference will still capture that. So sum should work regardless of duplicates. Let me test this with examples.Take example 1: A sum is 4+8+1+3+7 = 23. B sum is 7+4+3+1=15. 23-15=8. Which is correct.Another example: A is 12,10,15,23,11,30. Sum is 12+10+15+23+11+30 = let&#39;s see: 12+10=22, +15=37, +23=60, +11=71, +30=101. B sum is 15+12+23+11+30. Let&#39;s calculate: 15+12=27, +23=50, +11=61, +30=91. 101-91=10, which is correct.So even with duplicates, as long as the missing element is the only one that&#39;s different in count between A and B, the sum method works. Wait, but what if there are duplicates and the sum difference is due to multiple elements? Like, suppose A is [2,2,3] and B is [2,3]. Then sum A is 7, sum B is 5. Difference is 2, which is correct. But if A was [3,3], B is [3], sum difference is 3, which is correct. So sum approach works even with duplicates. So this seems to be a valid approach.So the algorithm would be to compute the sum of A minus the sum of B, and return that difference. That&#39;s O(N) time and O(1) space, as required.But wait, what about the constraints on the elements? The elements can be up to 1e18. So summing them might cause integer overflow in some languages, but Python&#39;s integers can handle arbitrarily large numbers, so no problem there.So the steps are:1. Compute sum of A.2. Compute sum of B.3. Subtract sum B from sum A; the result is the missing number.But how to handle the inputs? The function is given a, b, n. Where n is the size of A, and the size of B is n-1.Wait, the parameters are a and b, which are the arrays. So for example, in the first example, a has 5 elements, b has 4. So the code would sum all elements in a, sum all elements in b, subtract.Yes. So the code is straightforward.Now, let&#39;s write the Python function.But wait, what about edge cases? For example, if all elements are the same except one. Like A is [5,5,5], B is [5,5]. The missing element is 5. Sum of A is 15, sum of B is 10, difference 5. Correct.Another case: N=2. A has two elements, B has one. Sum difference gives the correct missing element.So the approach should handle all cases.Thus, the function can be implemented as follows:def findMissing(self, a, b, n):    sum_a = sum(a)    sum_b = sum(b)    return sum_a - sum_bWait, but wait, in Python, the sum of an array can be computed quickly. So for very large N (up to 1e6), this is manageable. Since sum is O(N) time, which is acceptable.Yes. So this code should work.Testing the first example:A = [4,8,1,3,7], sum is 23. B is [7,4,3,1], sum 15. 23-15=8. Correct.Another example: A sum 101, B sum 91. 10.Yes.So this seems to be the solution.But wait, what if there&#39;s a possibility of multiple elements being missing but the sum difference is correct? But according to the problem statement, exactly one element is removed. So the sum difference is exactly the missing element, regardless of duplicates.So this approach is correct.So the code is as simple as returning the sum difference. That&#39;s the solution.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing element in array B, which is a shuffled version of array A with one element removed. The solution should efficiently compute the missing element with a time complexity of O(N) and constant auxiliary space. ApproachThe key insight is that the sum of all elements in array A minus the sum of all elements in array B will yield the missing element. This approach works because:1. The sum of elements in A includes all elements, including the one missing in B.2. The sum of elements in B excludes exactly one element from A.3. The difference between these two sums directly gives the missing element.This approach is efficient and handles all edge cases, including arrays with duplicates and very large element values, thanks to Python&#39;s ability to handle arbitrarily large integers.

Reading Input: The input is read from standard input and split into a list of integers.2. Parsing Arrays: The first integer `n` represents the size of array A. The next `n` integers form array A, followed by `n-1` integers forming array B.3. Computing Sums: The sum of elements in array A and array B are computed using Python&#39;s built-in `sum()` function.4. Finding the Missing Element: The difference between the sums of A and B gives the missing element, which is then printed.This approach ensures that we efficiently find the missing element in linear time with constant space, meeting the problem constraints and requirements.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-6d2bec23 data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review" data-v-aa4c0186><div class="review-title" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>❓:</span>You are given a standard 8 times 8 chessboard which has exactly 3 pieces placed on it - 2 black rooks and 1 white king. The rows are numbered 1 to 8 from bottom to top, and the columns are numbered 1 to 8 from left to right. The cell at the intersection of the i-th column and j-th row is denoted (i, j) (like the coordinate system on the xy-plane).Is it possible for the white king to be checkmated by the rooks in exactly one move? It is guaranteed that the initial position of pieces is such that the white king is not under check.Note that in the given situation, black moves first.Assume that all the chess rules are to be followed:Each square can contain at most one piece.Rooks can only travel in straight lines along the row or column they are placed at, and can&#39;t jump over other pieces.The King can move to any of its 8 adjacent squares.A piece can&#39;t capture a piece of the same color as itself.After a black makes a move, the white king can capture a rook if it&#39;s present on any of the 8 adjacent squares and not protected by the other rook.The king is said to be in [checkmate] if the king is currently under check and there exists no legal move with the king to escape from the check.[Stalemate] is considered as a draw for both sides.For a more detailed explanation of the moves of pieces, along with images, please [click here].

So, the question is whether the black rooks can checkmate the white king in exactly one move. The black moves first, and after their move, the king must be in checkmate. Also, initially, the king is not under check. First, I need to understand what checkmate means here. Checkmate occurs when the king is in check (attacked by an opponent&#39;s piece) and has no legal moves to escape. So, after black moves a rook, the king must be in check, and all the king&#39;s possible next moves must also be under attack. Also, the king can&#39;t move to a square that&#39;s under attack by another rook unless that rook is captured (but then, if capturing is possible, but the other rook is protecting that square, then the king can&#39;t capture).Let me think about the steps to solve this. The problem requires checking all possible moves of the two rooks (since black can choose to move either rook) and see if any of those moves result in a checkmate. So for each rook, we need to consider all possible squares it can move to, given the chess rules for rook movement. Then, for each such new position, check if the king is in check, and whether all the king&#39;s possible moves are covered.But since T is up to 1.6e5, the solution needs to be efficient. So we can&#39;t simulate all possible rook moves for each test case. Instead, we need a smarter approach.So let&#39;s break down the problem:For each test case, we need to check if there exists a move (either rook1 moving or rook2 moving) such that after the move:1. The king is in check (i.e., the king&#39;s position is in the line of sight of one or both rooks, considering that after moving, the other rook may block the path). Wait, but the rook can&#39;t jump over pieces. So when a rook moves, the other rook is still on the board. So, for example, if a rook moves to a position that&#39;s in the same row as the king, but the other rook is blocking the path, then that rook can&#39;t attack the king.Wait, no. The other rook is of the same color, so the moving rook can&#39;t pass through it. So after moving, the new position of the rook must not be blocked by the other rook. Also, when determining if the king is under attack, the attacking rook&#39;s line must be clear except for any other pieces (but the other rook is black, so the same color. So if a rook moves to a position where it&#39;s in the same row or column as the king, and there&#39;s a clear path (no pieces between), then the king is in check.Wait, but the two rooks are black. So, if a rook moves to a position, the other rook might be in the same row or column as the king. But the other rook could block the path. So for example, after moving rook1 to a new position, if in the same row as the king, but the other rook is between them, then the king is not in check from rook1.So, for the king to be in check after moving a rook, the following must be true:Either:- The rook is in the same row as the king, and between them (along that row) there are no other pieces. So the path is clear. Or,- The rook is in the same column as the king, with a clear path.But also, the king could be in check by both rooks. But that&#39;s allowed. So when checking for check after moving a rook, the other rook might also be attacking, but perhaps blocked by the moved rook.Wait, no. The other rook is in its original position unless it&#39;s the one being moved. So if we move rook1, then rook2&#39;s position is unchanged. So when moving rook1, we need to check if after the move, the king is in check by rook1 and/or rook2. But since the initial positions are such that the king is not under check (so originally, neither rook is attacking him), moving a rook could create an attack.So the key steps are:For each possible rook move (either rook1 or rook2):1. Check if the move is valid (doesn&#39;t overlap with other pieces, the path is clear when moving the rook). Wait, the rook can move any number of squares along a row or column, but cannot jump over other pieces. So when moving a rook from (x, y) to (x&#39;, y&#39;), it can only do so if either x&#39; = x or y&#39; = y (same row or column), and the path between (x, y) and (x&#39;, y&#39;) is clear except for the other pieces (the king and other rook). Wait, but the other rook is the only other piece. So, for example, if moving a rook along a row, there must be no other pieces between the original and new positions. So the path must be clear except for the destination square, which could be empty (assuming the destination isn&#39;t the same as any other piece).So when moving a rook, the destination must be a square in the same row or column as the original position. Also, the path between the original and destination positions (in that row or column) must be empty except for the destination square (which can be any square in that line, as long as it&#39;s not occupied by another piece. Because the rook can&#39;t jump over other pieces, including the king or the other rook.So, for each rook (say, rook at (x, y)), possible moves are all squares in the same row or column that are reachable (i.e., no pieces in between). The destination square can&#39;t be occupied by any other piece (king or other rook). Because pieces can&#39;t overlap.So first, for each rook, generate all possible squares they can move to. Then, for each such possible move, check if the resulting position puts the king in check, and whether the king has no escape.But generating all possible moves for each rook would be time-consuming for large T. So we need a way to compute this efficiently.Let&#39;s think about the conditions for checkmate after a rook move.The checkmate requires:1. After moving a rook, the king is in check (i.e., attacked by at least one rook, with clear path).2. All of the king&#39;s adjacent squares (including diagonally adjacent) are either:   a. Under attack by a rook (with clear path), or   b. Occupied by a friendly piece (but here, the king is white and the rooks are black, so the king can&#39;t move into a square occupied by a rook unless capturing it. But capturing is allowed if the rook is not protected. Wait, the problem statement says:   &quot;After a black makes a move, the white king can capture a rook if it&#39;s present on any of the 8 adjacent squares and not protected by the other rook.&quot;So when the king is checking for possible moves, for each adjacent square, the king can move there if:- The square is not under attack by any rook (so, if the square is attacked, then moving there is not allowed unless the king can capture the attacking rook, but only if that rook is not protected by the other rook.Wait, the problem statement says:The king can move to any of its 8 adjacent squares. However:- The square must not be under attack by any rook (i.e., the square is not in the line of fire of any rook with a clear path), unless the king can capture the attacking rook. But when the king captures a rook, if the other rook is attacking the same square, then that square is still under attack, and the king can&#39;t move there. Wait, the exact rules from the problem statement:&quot;A piece can&#39;t capture a piece of the same color as itself.&quot;So the king (white) can capture a black rook if it&#39;s adjacent, but only if that rook is not protected by the other black rook. Because, after capturing, the rook is removed, but the other rook would then attack the king if the square is under attack.But for checkmate, the king is in check and has no legal moves. So, after the rook&#39;s move, the king must be in check, and all 8 adjacent squares must be either:- Under attack by a rook (so moving there would put the king in check again), or- If the square has a rook (which is possible if the rook moved there and is adjacent), then the king can capture it only if the other rook is not attacking that square. So in that case, capturing that rook would leave the king not under attack, but if the other rook is attacking the king&#39;s original position, then after capturing, the king might be in check again.This is getting complicated. Let&#39;s try to structure this.After a black moves a rook to a new position:1. The king must be in check. That is, the king&#39;s position is under attack by at least one rook. For this to happen, the new position of the rook (and/or the other rook&#39;s position) must be attacking the king&#39;s position, with a clear path.2. The king has no legal moves. So, for each of the 8 adjacent squares (including the current position&#39;s adjacent squares), the king cannot move to any of them. For each adjacent square (i, j):   a. If moving there would escape check, then that move is allowed. So the checkmate isn&#39;t possible.So, for the checkmate, all adjacent squares must be either:   - Under attack by a rook (so moving there would still be in check), or   - The square is occupied by a rook, and capturing it is not possible (i.e., the other rook is attacking the square, so capturing would result in being in check again).Additionally, the king&#39;s current square must be under attack (i.e., in check).So, the steps for each possible rook move are:1. Check if moving the rook to (new_x, new_y) is a valid move (same row or column, path is clear, no overlapping with other pieces).2. After moving, check if the king&#39;s position is under attack by either rook.   - For each rook (including the moved one and the other one), check if they attack the king. The attack is possible only if they are in the same row or column, and the path between the rook and the king is clear (no other pieces in between).3. If the king is in check (i.e., at least one rook attacks him), then check if all adjacent squares are either under attack by a rook (after the move), or occupied by a rook that can&#39;t be captured (because the other rook is protecting it).So, for each adjacent square (dx, dy) of the king&#39;s position (xk, yk):   For dx in [-1, 0, 1], dy in [-1, 0, 1], except (0,0), because the king can move to any adjacent.   For each (xk + dx, yk + dy):   Check if the square is on the board (1 &lt;= x &lt;=8, 1 &lt;= y &lt;=8).   If the square is occupied by a rook (the moved or the other one), then:      To capture, the king can move there only if the other rook is not attacking that square.      So, after capturing the rook (say, rook1), the other rook (rook2) must not be attacking that square (since rook2 is still on the board).      So, when the king captures a rook on that square, he moves there, but then if the other rook attacks that square, then the king is in check again. Therefore, the capture is only possible if after capturing, the king is not under check. So in that case, the move is allowed, hence the checkmate is not achieved.   If the square is empty, then check if it&#39;s under attack by any rook. If it is, then the king can&#39;t move there. Otherwise, he can.So, for the king to be checkmated, all adjacent squares must be either:   - Under attack by a rook (so moving there would put him in check again), or   - Occupied by a rook, but capturing that rook is not possible (because after capturing, the king would be in check from the other rook).Additionally, the current position of the king must be under attack (check).So, let&#39;s formalize this:After moving a rook (say, rook A) to a new position (x, y), and possibly the other rook (B) is in its original position:Check if:1. The king is in check (attacked by A and/or B).2. For every adjacent square (dx, dy) of the king&#39;s position:   a. If the square is empty:      i. It is under attack by any rook (A or B) after the move. If yes, the king can&#39;t move there. If no, then he can, so checkmate fails.   b. If the square is occupied by a rook (either A or B):      i. Check if capturing that rook would leave the king in check. Because when the king captures the rook, that rook is removed, but the other rook (if exists) might be attacking the square. So, after capture, the king is in the square where the rook was. So, we need to check if that square is under attack by the other rook.      So, after capturing, the king is at (square_x, square_y). The other rook (if any) must not be attacking that square.      Because, if the other rook is attacking that square, then after capturing, the king is in check again, hence that move is invalid.      Therefore, the king can only capture the rook if, after capturing, he is not in check.      So, for a square occupied by a rook (say rook A), the king can move there only if the other rook (B) does not attack that square (after A has moved).   So, the king can capture the rook in that square only if:      - The other rook (B) is not attacking that square.      So, if after moving rook A to (x, y), the square (nx, ny) where the rook is (say rook A&#39;s new position) is adjacent to the king, and the other rook (B) does not attack (nx, ny), then the king can capture rook A, thereby escaping the check. So checkmate would not occur.   Therefore, for each adjacent square with a rook, check if the other rook is attacking that square. If not, then the king can capture, so the move is possible, hence checkmate is not achieved.So, combining all these conditions, we need to check for each possible rook move whether after that move:- The king is in check.- All adjacent squares (including those occupied by rooks) are either under attack, or occupied by a rook that is protected (so capturing is not possible).Now, the problem is how to compute this efficiently.Let&#39;s think of the steps for a single test case:Given the positions of the king (xk, yk), rook1 (x1, y1), rook2 (x2, y2):We need to check if moving either rook1 or rook2 to a new position can result in a checkmate.So, for each rook (say rook1):Possible moves are all squares in the same row or column as rook1&#39;s original position (x1, y1), that are reachable (no pieces in between), and the destination square is not occupied by any other piece.But how to compute reachable squares efficiently?For a rook at (x, y), the possible squares in the same row (x) are all (x, y&#39;) where y&#39; can be any column, but the path between (x, y) and (x, y&#39;) must be clear except for the other rook and king.Wait, the king and other rook are possible obstacles. So, when moving a rook along a row or column, the path must be clear except for the other pieces (king and other rook).Wait, but the rook can&#39;t jump over any pieces. So, in the same row, the rook can move to any square in that row except those blocked by other pieces.For example, in the same row, the rook can move to any square in that row, but the path between the original position and the destination must be clear. So, the destination can be any square in the same row or column where there are no pieces between the rook&#39;s original position and the destination. Also, the destination square must not be occupied by another piece (since pieces can&#39;t overlap).So, for rook1 in (x1, y1):In the same row (x1), the possible destinations are:- All squares to the left of y1 (columns 1 to y1-1), but only up to the first obstacle (king or rook2).- All squares to the right of y1 (columns y1+1 to 8), but only up to the first obstacle.Similarly for the column y1.So, for example, in the same row x1, the rook can move to any column y&#39; such that:- In the same row x1.- All squares between y1 and y&#39; (exclusive) are empty (i.e., not occupied by king or other rook).- The destination (x1, y&#39;) is not occupied by any other piece (king or other rook).So, for each direction (left, right, up, down), the rook can move as far as possible until it hits an obstacle (king or other rook). The destination can be any square along that line until the first obstacle.Wait, but the rook can stop at any square before the obstacle. For example, if there&#39;s an obstacle three squares to the right, the rook can move one, two, three squares to the right (but can&#39;t go beyond the obstacle). But in chess, the rook can move any number of squares along the line until blocked. So, the rook can move to any square in the same row/column that is reachable, i.e., the path is clear between the original position and the destination.So, the possible destinations for a rook are:All squares in the same row or column as its current position, where:- The path from the original position to the destination (along the same row or column) is clear of any pieces (king or other rook), except for the destination itself.But wait, the destination can be occupied by another piece. Because a rook cannot move to a square occupied by a same-color piece. But since the other rook is black (same color), the rook can&#39;t move to a square occupied by the other rook. The king is white, so the rook can&#39;t move there either. So, the destination square must be unoccupied.So, the possible destinations for a rook are the squares in the same row or column, which are not occupied by any other piece (king or other rook), and the path between the original position and the destination is clear (no pieces in between).So, for a rook, possible moves are:All squares in the same row or column, that are reachable (path is clear) and the destination is empty.So, to compute the possible moves for a rook, we need to check each direction (left, right, up, down) for the maximum possible movement, considering the king and other rook.This seems computationally expensive for large T. So, we need to find a way to compute this quickly.But perhaps, given the constraints of 8x8 board, we can model this efficiently.Alternatively, perhaps for a given rook and the positions of other pieces, we can find the possible destinations that would attack the king and also create a checkmate.But I&#39;m not sure. Let&#39;s think of the conditions.We need to find a rook move that results in the king being in check, and all adjacent squares being covered.So, maybe the checkmate can only happen if after moving a rook, the king is attacked by that rook in a way that his adjacent squares are blocked or under attack.For example, moving a rook to a square such that it attacks the king, and the other rook is positioned in such a way that it blocks the king&#39;s escape routes.Alternatively, moving a rook to create a &quot;box&quot; around the king.But how?Alternatively, perhaps the checkmate can be achieved by one of the rooks moving to a position that attacks the king&#39;s current position, and the other rook is positioned such that all adjacent squares are attacked by at least one rook, and any escape via capturing is blocked.But this seems a bit vague.Let me look at the sample input.Sample Input 1:4Test Case 1:King is at (1,1). Rooks are at (8,2) and (7,3).Sample Output: YES.Explanation: Moving the second rook (7,3) to (7,1). Let&#39;s see:Original positions:King (1,1). R1 at (8,2), R2 at (7,3).After moving R2 to (7,1):Now, R2 is at (7,1). Let&#39;s check if this is a valid move.R2&#39;s original position is (7,3). To move to (7,1), same row (7). The columns are 3 →1. The path is columns 3, 2, 1. Are there any pieces in between?Original pieces are king at (1,1) (row 1), rook1 at (8,2) (row 8). Rook2 is moving from (7,3) to (7,1). Between 3 and 1, columns 2 and 1. Are there any pieces in row 7, columns 2? Let&#39;s see. The other rook is at (8,2), which is in a different row. The king is at (1,1), different row. So, the path is clear. So moving to (7,1) is allowed.Now, after moving, does the rook2 attack the king?The king is at (1,1). Rook2 is at (7,1) → same column (y=1). The path is from (7,1) to (1,1). Are there any pieces in between?The rows are from 7 down to 1. The squares between are rows 6,5,4,3,2,1. But the king is at (1,1). So the path is clear (since other rook is at (8,2) in row 8, column 2). So yes, the rook2 attacks the king.Now, check if the king is in check. Yes, because he is attacked by rook2.Now, the king&#39;s adjacent squares are:(0,0) is invalid. Let&#39;s list all 8 possible squares:(0,0) → invalid.Original position (1,1). Adjacent squares:(1+dx, 1+dy) where dx and dy are -1, 0, +1 (excluding (0,0)).So:(0, 0) → invalid.(0, 1) → invalid.(0, 2) → invalid.(1, 0) → invalid.(1, 2) → valid.(2, 0) → invalid.(2, 1) → valid.(2, 2) → valid.So the valid adjacent squares are (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). Also, (1,0), (0,1), etc. are out of bounds.Wait, the king is at (1,1). The adjacent squares are:For rows 1-1=0 (invalid) and 1+1=2. Columns 1-1=0 (invalid), 1, 1+1=2.So the valid adjacent squares are:(1, 2), (2,1), (2,2), (1,0) invalid, (0,1) invalid, (2,0) invalid, (0,0) invalid, (0,2) invalid.So the king can move to (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).Now, after moving R2 to (7,1), the king is in check.Now, check if all these adjacent squares are under attack or occupied by a rook that can&#39;t be captured.For (1,2):Check if it&#39;s under attack by any rook.R1 is at (8,2). So same column (y=2) as (1,2). The path from R1 to (1,2) is row 8 →1. Are there any pieces in between? The path is column 2. R1 is at (8,2), the square (1,2) is in row 1. So the path between (8,2) and (1,2) is row 8 down to row 1 in column 2. Are there any pieces in between? The king is at (1,1), so not in this column. R2 is at (7,1), which is in column 1, not 2. So the path is clear. So R1 can attack (1,2). So the king can&#39;t move to (1,2), because it&#39;s under attack.For (2,1):Check if it&#39;s under attack. R2 is at (7,1) (same column). The path from R2 to (2,1) is from row 7 to 2 in column 1. Are there any pieces in between? The king is at (1,1), which is in row 1. So the path from R2&#39;s position (7,1) to (2,1) is rows 7,6,5,4,3,2. No pieces in between. So R2 attacks (2,1). So moving here is not allowed.For (2,2):Check if it&#39;s under attack by any rook. R1 is at (8,2), same column (y=2) as (2,2). The path from R1 to (2,2) is row 8 to 2. Are there any pieces in between? The king is at (1,1), R2 is at (7,1). So the path is clear. So R1 attacks (2,2). So king can&#39;t move here.So all adjacent squares are under attack. Therefore, the king can&#39;t move anywhere. So checkmate is achieved. Hence, the answer is YES.So this scenario is valid.So the approach is to check for each rook&#39;s possible moves that:- The move is valid (path is clear, destination is empty).- After moving, the king is in check.- All adjacent squares are either under attack or occupied by a rook that can&#39;t be captured.Now, the challenge is to compute this efficiently.But given the time constraints, we need a solution that can handle T=1.6e5 efficiently.So, how can we model this?Let&#39;s think about possible scenarios where a checkmate can happen in one move.The checkmate requires that after moving a rook, the king is in a position where:1. The king&#39;s current position is attacked by at least one rook (the moved rook or the other).2. All adjacent squares are either:   a. Attacked by a rook (so the king can&#39;t move there).   b. Occupied by a rook, but capturing it would result in being in check again.So, perhaps the checkmate can occur in the following ways:- The moved rook attacks the king in a row or column, and the other rook is positioned such that all adjacent squares are attacked by one of the rooks. But how?Alternatively, the moved rook and the other rook are positioned in such a way that all squares around the king are attacked.Alternatively, the moved rook attacks the king, and the king is in a corner (like the sample input 1), and all escape squares are attacked by the other rook.But how?Let&#39;s consider the sample input 1. After moving R2 to (7,1), R2 attacks the king&#39;s position. R1 (8,2) is in column 2, which attacks the king&#39;s adjacent squares (1,2) and (2,2). R2 attacks (2,1). So the three adjacent squares are covered by R1 and R2.Another scenario: perhaps the moved rook and the other rook form a cross that blocks all escape routes.But how to find this efficiently.Another idea: For a checkmate to happen in one move, the moved rook must attack the king&#39;s current position. The other rook may contribute to covering some adjacent squares.Wait, but the king is initially not under check. So moving a rook into a position that attacks the king is necessary.So, the first condition is that after moving a rook, it attacks the king, and the other rook may contribute to covering adjacent squares.So, the moved rook&#39;s position must be in the same row or column as the king, with a clear path. Also, the other rook may be positioned in a way that covers some adjacent squares.So, for each rook, possible moves that attack the king:Case 1: Rook moves to the same row as the king, and the path is clear.Case 2: Rook moves to the same column as the king, path is clear.In either case, after moving, the rook attacks the king.Now, for the checkmate, all adjacent squares must be covered.So, after moving the rook to attack the king, the other rook must cover all squares that are not covered by the moved rook.Alternatively, the moved rook may cover all escape squares.But this is unlikely because the king has 8 adjacent squares. So perhaps the other rook is positioned in such a way that it covers the remaining squares.Alternatively, the king is in a corner, and the moved rook attacks along one line, and the other rook covers the other line.For example, the sample input 1: king is at (1,1). After moving R2 to (7,1) (same column), the king&#39;s adjacent squares are (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). R1 is at (8,2) (same column as (1,2) and (2,2)), so R1 attacks those squares. R2 attacks (2,1). So all three squares are under attack.So the key is that the two rooks cover all the king&#39;s adjacent squares.So, to find a checkmate scenario, after moving a rook to attack the king, we need to check whether the other rook&#39;s current position (since it hasn&#39;t moved) covers all adjacent squares that are not covered by the moved rook.Alternatively, perhaps the moved rook covers all squares, but that&#39;s only possible if the king is in a corner and the rook is placed in a way that all adjacent squares are in the same row or column.But that&#39;s unlikely.Alternatively, the moved rook and the existing rook together cover all adjacent squares.So, perhaps the approach is:For each rook (R1 and R2), check if moving it to a position where it attacks the king (same row or column, path clear) and then check if the other rook&#39;s current position covers the adjacent squares that the moved rook doesn&#39;t cover.But how to compute this.Alternatively, for each possible move of a rook that results in it attacking the king, check if all adjacent squares of the king are covered by the two rooks.But how to compute coverage.For each adjacent square (nx, ny) of the king:It is under attack by a rook if either R1 or R2 (after the move) can attack (nx, ny), i.e., they are in the same row or column, and the path between (nx, ny) and the rook is clear.So, for each adjacent square (nx, ny):Check if any of the two rooks (after the move) can attack it.But in this case, the moved rook&#39;s new position is known, and the other rook is in its original position.So, for each rook move candidate, after the move, the two rooks are at positions (new_x, new_y) for the moved one, and (old_x, old_y) for the other.For each adjacent square (nx, ny) of the king:Check if (nx, ny) is attacked by either rook.Additionally, if (nx, ny) is occupied by a rook (either one), then check if capturing that rook is possible.But how.This seems computationally heavy, but perhaps manageable for 8x8 boards.So, here&#39;s the plan:For each test case:1. Get the positions of king (xk, yk), rook1 (x1, y1), rook2 (x2, y2).2. For each rook (rook1 and rook2):   a. Consider all possible moves of the rook to a new position (x, y) where:      i. (x, y) is in the same row or column as the rook&#39;s original position.      ii. The path between the rook&#39;s original position and (x, y) is clear (i.e., no pieces in between).      iii. (x, y) is not occupied by the king or other rook.   b. For each possible new position (x, y):      i. Check if the rook&#39;s new position is attacking the king (same row or column, path clear).      ii. If yes, then check if all adjacent squares of the king are either:          - Attacked by the moved rook or the other rook (after the move).          - Or, occupied by a rook (moved or other), and capturing that rook would leave the king in check (i.e., the other rook attacks the captured square).   c. If any such move exists, return YES.3. If neither rook has such a move, return NO.But generating all possible moves for each rook is time-consuming. So, perhaps we can find for each rook the possible positions where moving to them would attack the king and also cover all adjacent squares.But how.Alternatively, for each rook, the possible positions that attack the king are those in the same row or column as the king, with a clear path.But the rook must move to such a position in a valid way.So, for each rook, check if it can move to a square that is in the same row or column as the king, with a clear path to the king, and the destination square is empty.If such a position exists, then we need to check the adjacent squares.But how to compute this.For example, for rook1 (x1, y1):Check if it can move to a square in the same row as the king (xk, yk) or same column.Let&#39;s say the king is at (xk, yk).So, for rook1 to attack the king after moving, it must be placed in the same row or column.So, possible positions are:In the same row as the king: (xk, y&#39;) for any y&#39; such that the path from (x1, y1) to (xk, y&#39;) is clear, and y&#39; is not blocked.Wait, no. Rook1 can move along its own row or column. So, to attack the king after moving, rook1 must be in the same row or column as the king.So, rook1 can move to a position in the same row as the king (xk, y&#39;) or same column as the king (x&#39;, yk).But how can rook1 move to such a position?For example, if the king is in row xk, and rook1 is in row xr. Then, rook1 can move to row xk only if it&#39;s along the same column. Wait, no. Rook1&#39;s movement is along its current row or column. So, unless rook1 is already in the same row or column as the king&#39;s row or column, moving to attack would require moving into that row or column.Wait, but the initial positions are such that the king is not under attack. So, the initial positions of the rooks are not in the same row or column as the king.So, for a rook to attack the king after moving, it must move into the same row or column as the king.But how?Let me think:Initially, the rooks are not in the same row or column as the king (since the king is not under check).So, to move into a position that is in the same row or column as the king, the rook must move from its original position to that row or column.For example, the king is in row 1, column 1.Rook1 is in row 8, column 2.To attack the king, rook1 needs to move into row 1 or column 1.So, for rook1 to attack the king&#39;s row (row 1), it must move to (1, y&#39;), but rook1&#39;s original position is (8, 2). So to move to row 1, rook1 must move down the column 2 from row 8 to 1. But the path must be clear.But the king is at (1,1), which is not in column 2. So the path from (8,2) to (1,2) is column 2, row 8 to 1. Are there any pieces in that column? The other rook is at (7,3), which is in column 3. So the path is clear. So rook1 can move to (1,2), which is in the same row as the king (row 1).But when rook1 moves to (1,2), the king is in row 1. So rook1 is now attacking the king&#39;s row, and since the path is clear (same row), the king is in check.So, in this case, moving rook1 to (1,2) is a valid move.But in this scenario, after moving, rook1 is in (1,2), and the other rook is in (7,3). Now, check if all adjacent squares of the king (1,1) are under attack.Adjascent squares:(1,2) is occupied by rook1. The king can capture it if the other rook (7,3) is not attacking (1,2).So, when the king captures rook1 at (1,2), he moves there. Then, he is in (1,2). Check if the other rook (7,3) attacks (1,2).Rook2 is at (7,3). (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. Rook2&#39;s column is 3. So, the row is 7, column 3. The path to (1,2) would require same row or column. Not in same row or column. So, no. So the king can capture rook1 and escape check. Hence, checkmate is not achieved.So, this move would not result in checkmate.But in the sample input, the correct move was moving rook2 to (7,1), which is in the same column as the king.So, the idea is that after moving the rook to attack the king, the other rook must cover all possible escape squares.So, perhaps the approach is to find a move for either rook where:- The moved rook attacks the king (same row or column, path clear).- The other rook is positioned such that all adjacent squares of the king are either:   a. Attacked by the moved rook.   b. Attacked by the other rook.   c. Occupied by a rook (moved or other) and capturing it would leave the king under attack.This way, the king has no valid moves.So, for each rook, the steps are:1. Find all possible positions where moving the rook to that position results in attacking the king.   - This requires the rook&#39;s new position to be in the same row or column as the king, and the path between the new position and the king is clear (no other pieces in between).   - The move to the new position must be valid (path from original position to new position is clear, and new position is empty).2. For each such new position, check if all adjacent squares of the king are covered (either attacked by either rook, or occupied by a rook that can&#39;t be captured).But how to compute this.An alternative approach is to precompute for each possible rook move that attacks the king, and then check the coverage of the adjacent squares.But given the time constraints, this might not be feasible for large T.So, perhaps we can find a pattern.The checkmate can only happen if after moving a rook to attack the king, the other rook is positioned such that all adjacent squares are attacked by either rook.Alternatively, the moved rook&#39;s new position and the other rook&#39;s position are arranged in a way that all adjacent squares are covered.For example, if the king is in a corner and the two rooks are positioned such that one attacks the row and the other attacks the column, blocking all escape squares.So, perhaps the checkmate is possible only in certain configurations.But how to code this.Another Idea:For a rook to move to a position that attacks the king, it must be in the same row or column. Let&#39;s consider each case.Case 1: Rook moves to same row as king.In this case, the rook is in (xk, y_new). The path between (xk, y_new) and (xk, yk) must be clear. Since the king is at (xk, yk), there can&#39;t be any pieces between (xk, y_new) and (xk, yk) except for the other rook.Wait, no. The other rook is in its original position. So, when a rook moves to (xk, y_new), the path between the new position and the king must be clear. So, between y_new and yk (same row), there must be no pieces (king or other rook).But the king is at (xk, yk), so if the rook is in the same row, the path between the new position and the king&#39;s column must be clear. So, for the rook to attack the king after moving to (xk, y_new), there must be no pieces between (xk, y_new) and (xk, yk).But the king is in (xk, yk), which is in the same row. So, the only way this is possible is if y_new is directly in line with the king and there are no other pieces in between.But the king is present in (xk, yk), which is in the same row. So, the rook can&#39;t be in the same row as the king, because there&#39;s the king in between. Unless the rook&#39;s new position is adjacent to the king in the same row.Wait, this is impossible. Because the rook&#39;s new position is in the same row as the king. But between the rook and the king, there can&#39;t be any other pieces (like the other rook or the king).But the king is present at (xk, yk), so for the rook to attack the king in the same row, the rook&#39;s new position must be in the same row, and the path between them must be clear. But the king is in that row. So the rook must be in the same row, and the path must be clear. But the king is in the same row as the rook&#39;s new position, so there can&#39;t be any pieces between. So the rook must be placed in a position where between the rook and the king in that row, there are no other pieces.But the king is at (xk, yk), so the rook&#39;s new position must be in the same row (xk), and the path between (xk, y_new) and (xk, yk) must be clear, meaning that between y_new and yk, there are no other pieces. But the other rook is at (x2, y2), which is not in the same row as xk (since the king is not under check initially). So, the other rook is in a different row. So, the path between (xk, y_new) and (xk, yk) is clear.So, for example, if the rook moves to (xk, yk + 1), then there&#39;s the king at (xk, yk), so the path between (xk, yk + 1) and the king is blocked by the king. So the rook can&#39;t attack the king. So, this is not possible.Ah, right. Because the rook&#39;s line of sight is blocked by the king himself. So, even if the rook is placed in the same row as the king, but the king is between the rook and the other squares, the rook can&#39;t attack the king.Wait, no. Because the king is a piece. So, if a rook is in the same row or column as the king, but there are no pieces between them, then the rook can attack the king. Otherwise, if there&#39;s a piece in between, then the rook&#39;s attack is blocked.But in this scenario, the rook&#39;s new position is in the same row as the king, but the king is in between the rook&#39;s new position and any other squares. So, the rook can&#39;t attack the king.So, this suggests that the rook can&#39;t attack the king by being in the same row as the king. Because the king himself is in that row, and the path is blocked.Wait, but the rook&#39;s line of attack is along the same row or column. So, if the rook is placed in the same row as the king, but there are no pieces between them, then the rook can attack the king.But in this case, the rook&#39;s new position is in the same row as the king, but the king is between the rook and the end of the row. So, for example, if the rook is at (xk, y_new) where y_new &gt; yk, then the path between the rook and the king is clear (since there are no other pieces between y_new and yk). Wait, but the king is at (xk, yk). So, if the rook is placed at (xk, yk+1), then between the rook and the king there&#39;s the square (xk, yk). Which is occupied by the king. So, the path is blocked. Hence, the rook can&#39;t attack the king.Ah! Right. So, for a rook to attack the king in the same row, it must be placed in such a way that there are no pieces between the rook and the king. But the king himself is a piece. So, the rook can&#39;t attack the king by being in the same row, because the king is in that row and is between the rook and the end of the line.Therefore, the only way a rook can attack the king after moving is by being in the same column as the king, and the path between the rook&#39;s new position and the king&#39;s position is clear.Wait, but the king&#39;s column is initially not occupied by any rook, since the king is not under check. So, after moving a rook into the same column as the king, the path must be clear.So, for example, the king is at (xk, yk). Rook moves into column yk. So, the rook&#39;s new position is (x_new, yk). The path from (x_new, yk) to (xk, yk) must be clear. That is, between x_new and xk in column yk, there must be no other pieces.But the other rook is in some other position. So, as long as the other rook is not in column yk, then the path is clear.Wait, but the other rook&#39;s position is (x2, y2). So, if y2 != yk, then it&#39;s not in the same column. So, moving a rook to (x_new, yk) (same column as king) requires that the path between x_new and xk is clear.So, for example, rook1 moves from (x1, y1) to (x_new, yk). The path is along column yk from x_new to xk. Are there any pieces in between?The other rook is at (x2, y2), which is not in column yk (since initial positions have the king not under check). So, the other rook is in a different column.The king is at (xk, yk). So, between x_new and xk in column yk, the only piece is the king. So, if the rook is placed at x_new &gt; xk, then the path from x_new down to xk is blocked by the king. So, the rook can&#39;t attack the king.Wait, no. If the rook is placed at x_new &lt; xk, then the path between x_new and xk would be clear (assuming no other pieces). But the king is at xk. So, the rook is in column yk, and the path from x_new to xk is clear. But the rook is in column yk, and the king is at (xk, yk). So, the rook can attack the king only if there are no pieces between them. But the king is at xk, yk, which is in the same column. So, the path between (x_new, yk) and (xk, yk) is the squares (x_new, yk), (x_new+1, yk), ..., (xk-1, yk), (xk, yk). So, if x_new &lt; xk, then the path is clear if there are no other pieces between x_new and xk. But the king is at xk. So, if x_new &lt; xk, then the path between the rook and the king is clear (assuming no other pieces in between), but the king is at xk. So the rook can attack the king.Yes. Because the rook is in (x_new, yk), and the king is in (xk, yk). The path between them is along the column yk. The squares between x_new and xk are empty (since the other rook is not in this column), and the king is at xk. So, the rook can attack the king.So, for example, if the king is at (1,1), and the rook moves to (7,1), then the rook is in the same column as the king. The path between (7,1) and (1,1) is clear (no other pieces in column 1). So, the rook can attack the king.So, the only way a rook can attack the king after moving is by being in the same column as the king, and the path between them is clear.So, this means that for a rook to attack the king after moving, it must be placed in the same column as the king, and there must be a clear path (no other pieces) between the rook&#39;s new position and the king&#39;s position.So, the steps are:For each rook:- Check if the rook can move to any position in the same column as the king&#39;s current column (yk), with a clear path to the king, and the destination is empty.Once the rook is in such a position, it attacks the king.Then, for each adjacent square of the king:Check if it is attacked by either rook (moved or other) or is occupied by a rook and capturing it is not possible.So, this narrows down the possible rook moves.Thus, the approach can be optimized as follows:For each rook:1. Check if the rook can move to the same column as the king&#39;s column (yk).   a. The rook&#39;s new position must be in the same column as the king.   b. The new position must be reachable from the rook&#39;s original position (i.e., path is clear).   c. The new position must not be occupied by any other piece.2. For each possible new position in the same column as the king:   a. Check if the path between the new position and the king is clear (no other pieces in between).   b. If so, then the rook can attack the king from there.   c. Now, check if all adjacent squares of the king are covered.So, the steps are:For each rook (R1 and R2):   For each possible new_x in the same column as the king (yk):      if new_x is in the same column as the king&#39;s column (yk), then:         Check if the rook can move to (new_x, yk) from its original position.         This requires:             - The rook&#39;s original position (xr, yr) must be in the same row or column as (new_x, yk). But since we&#39;re moving the rook to the same column as the king, the rook&#39;s original position must be in the same row as (new_x, yk) or the same column as (new_x, yk).             Wait, no. The rook can move from any position to (new_x, yk) as long as it&#39;s along the same row or column.             For example, if the rook&#39;s original position is (xr, yr), to move to (new_x, yk), it can move along the same column (yr) if possible, or along the same row (xr) if possible.             So, the movement to (new_x, yk) is possible if:                Either the rook is moving along its row (xr) to column yk (so, the rook&#39;s original position is (xr, yr), and the path to (xr, yk) is clear).                Or the rook is moving along its column (yr) to row new_x (but that would require new_x == xr, which is only possible if the rook is already in the same column as the king).             This seems complicated, but perhaps a simpler way is to calculate whether the rook can reach (new_x, yk) from its original position.The rook can move to (new_x, yk) if:   The rook&#39;s original position (xr, yr) is in the same row or column as (new_x, yk).   The path between (xr, yr) and (new_x, yk) is clear (no pieces in between).   The destination (new_x, yk) is not occupied by any other piece.So, for example, if the rook is at (xr, yr) and wants to move to (new_x, yk):   If yr == yk: then moving along the same column to new_x.   Or if xr == new_x: moving along the same row to yk.But wait, the destination is (new_x, yk). For example, if the rook is at (xr, yr), and wants to move to (new_x, yk):   If yr == yk: then the rook is already in the same column as the king. But the initial positions are such that the king is not under attack, so this is not possible. So, this case is invalid.   So, the rook must be in a different column than the king. So, to move to (new_x, yk), the rook must be in the same row as new_x, or the same column as new_x, yk&#39;s column (which is yk). But the original position&#39;s column is not yk (since the initial positions are such that the king is not under attack). So, the rook must move along the same row or column to reach (new_x, yk).So, for example, the rook is at (xr, yr) and wants to move to (new_x, yk). Since yr is not yk, the rook can reach (new_x, yk) via:   If new_x is in the same row as xr (i.e., new_x = xr), then the rook can move along the row to column yk, provided the path is clear.Or, if the new_x is in the same column as yr (but this would mean the new_x is along yr&#39;s column, which is not yk. So, the new_x is in column yr, which is not yk. So, this is not possible to reach (new_x, yk) this way.Wait, I&#39;m getting confused.Let&#39;s think of the rook&#39;s movement. A rook can move any number of squares along a row or column. So, to move from (xr, yr) to (new_x, yk), the rook can move either:   Along its original row (xr) to column yk: path is from (xr, yr) to (xr, yk). This is possible if yr != yk (since initially, the rook is not in the same column as the king). The path between yr and yk in row xr must be clear (no other pieces between yr and yk). And the destination (xr, yk) must be unoccupied.Or:   Along its original column (yr) to row new_x: but then the new_x would need to be in the same column (yr), but the destination is (new_x, yk). So this is possible only if yr == yk, which is not the case.So, the only way for the rook to reach (new_x, yk) is if new_x = xr, and the rook moves along its row to column yk. So, the new position is (xr, yk), but this requires that the path from yr to yk in row xr is clear.But the king is at (xk, yk). So, if the rook moves to (xr, yk), which is in the same column as the king (yk), then the path from the rook to the king&#39;s position (xk, yk) is along column yk from xr to xk. But the rook&#39;s new position is (xr, yk), which is in the same column as the king. So, the path between (xr, yk) and (xk, yk) must be clear (no other pieces in column yk between xr and xk).But the other rook is in (x2, y2), which is not in column yk (since the king is not under check initially).So, for the rook to attack the king after moving to (xr, yk), the path between (xr, yk) and (xk, yk) must be clear. Which requires that in column yk, between xr and xk, there are no pieces.But the king is at (xk, yk). So, if xr &lt; xk, then the path from xr to xk is blocked by the king. So, the rook can&#39;t attack the king.If xr &gt; xk, then the path from xr down to xk is blocked by the king. So again, no attack.Ah, right! Because the king is in (xk, yk), and the rook&#39;s new position is in (xr, yk) (same column). So, the path between (xr, yk) and the king&#39;s position is along column yk. If xr &gt; xk, then the path includes the king&#39;s position. So, the rook can&#39;t attack the king because the king is blocking the path.Only if the rook&#39;s new position is in the same column as the king, and there are no pieces between the rook and the king, can the rook attack the king.But since the king is in (xk, yk), the only way this is possible is if the rook&#39;s new position is in the same column as the king, and the rook is on the same side as the king, with no pieces in between.Wait, no. If the rook&#39;s new position is in the same column as the king, and the path between the rook and the king is clear, then the rook can attack the king. But the king is in the same column as the rook&#39;s new position. So, the path between them is blocked by the king.So, this suggests that the rook can&#39;t attack the king by moving to the same column as the king.But wait, in the sample input 1, rook2 moves to (7,1), which is in the same column as the king (1,1). The rook&#39;s new position is (7,1), king is at (1,1). The path between them is column 1, rows 7 to 1. Are there any pieces in between?The other rook is at (8,2), which is in row 8, column 2. So, the path between rook2&#39;s new position (7,1) and the king&#39;s position (1,1) is clear. So, the rook can attack the king.Ah! So in this case, the rook is in column 1, row 7. The king is in column 1, row 1. The path between them is clear, so the rook can attack.But wait, the king is in row 1, which is part of the path. So, how can the rook attack the king?Because the path from the rook to the king is along column 1. The rook is at (7,1), king at (1,1). The path between them is rows 7,6,5,4,3,2,1. The king is at row 1. So, the path between the rook and the king is clear. So, the rook can attack the king.Yes! Because the rook is in row 7, column 1. The king is in row 1, column 1. The path is from row 7 down to row 1. There are no pieces in between. So, the rook can attack the king.So, even though the king is in the same column, the path is clear (since the king is at the end of the path). So, the rook can attack the king.So, the key is that the rook&#39;s new position is in the same column as the king, and the path from the rook to the king is clear (no pieces in between). The king is not considered as blocking his own path for the purpose of rook attacks. Wait, no. The king is a piece. So, the rook&#39;s attack is blocked if any piece is between the rook and the target.But the king is the target. So, the path between the rook and the king must be clear, except for the king himself. So, the path is considered clear if there are no other pieces between the rook and the king.So, in this case, the rook&#39;s new position is (7,1). The king is at (1,1). The path between them is rows 7 to 1 in column 1. There are no other pieces in between. So, the rook can attack the king.So, this is possible.So, the rook can attack the king by moving to the same column, provided that the path between the rook and the king is clear.Therefore, the approach is:For each rook:   Check if it can move to any position (x_new, yk) in the same column as the king, such that:      a. The path from the rook&#39;s original position to (x_new, yk) is clear.      b. The path from (x_new, yk) to (xk, yk) is clear (i.e., no other pieces between x_new and xk in column yk).      c. (x_new, yk) is not occupied by any other piece.Once such a position is found, then after moving the rook there, the king is in check.Then, we need to check if all adjacent squares are covered.So, the steps are:For each rook (R1 and R2):   For the original position of the rook (xr, yr):   Check if yr can be changed to yk by moving along the row xr. So, the new position would be (xr, yk).   This requires that the rook can move along row xr from column yr to yk, with no pieces in between.   Additionally, the new position (xr, yk) must not be occupied by the king or other rook.   Then, check if the path from (xr, yk) to (xk, yk) in column yk is clear (no pieces between xr and xk).   If all this is true, then the rook can attack the king.   Then, check if all adjacent squares of the king are covered.Alternatively, the rook can move to (x_new, yk) where x_new is in column yk, but reached via a different row.Wait, but the rook can move to (x_new, yk) via moving along its column. For example, if the rook is in column yr, and moves along that column to x_new, then to (x_new, yk). But how?No, that&#39;s not possible. The rook can move in straight lines. So, to move to (x_new, yk), the rook must move either along its row or column.So, for example, if the rook is at (xr, yr), and wants to move to (x_new, yk), it can do so by moving along its row xr from column yr to yk (provided path is clear), or along its column yr from xr to x_new (provided path is clear), but in this case, the destination&#39;s column is yk, which is different from yr. So, moving along the column would require that x_new is in the same column as yr, but the destination&#39;s column is yk. So that&#39;s not possible.So, the only way to move to (x_new, yk) is if the rook is moving along its row xr to column yk. So, the new position is (xr, yk). Then, the path from (xr, yk) to the king&#39;s position (xk, yk) must be clear in column yk.So, the steps are:For each rook (R1 and R2) at (xr, yr):   If yr is not yk (since initially, the king is not in check), then:      The rook can move along its row xr to column yk (new position (xr, yk)), provided that:         1. The path from (xr, yr) to (xr, yk) is clear. This means that all squares between yr and yk in row xr are empty.         2. The new position (xr, yk) is not occupied by the king or other rook.         3. The path from (xr, yk) to (xk, yk) is clear. Since the rook is at (xr, yk), and the king is at (xk, yk), the path is along column yk. So, there should be no pieces between xr and xk in column yk.But the king is at (xk, yk), so if xr and xk are different, then the path between them in column yk would include the king&#39;s position only if xr &lt; xk or xr &gt; xk. For example, if xr &gt; xk, then the path from xr to xk in column yk would include the king&#39;s position. So, the path is blocked by the king.Wait, but the rook&#39;s new position is (xr, yk), and the king is at (xk, yk). The path between the rook and the king is along column yk. So, if xr &gt; xk, then the path is from xr down to xk. The king is at xk, so the path between xr and xk would include the king. So, the path is blocked. Therefore, the rook can&#39;t attack the king.But if xr is on the same side as xk (i.e., xr and xk are the same), then the rook is at the same row as the king. But that&#39;s impossible since initially, the king is not under check, and the rook is moving to the same column as the king.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s rephrase.The rook&#39;s new position is (xr, yk). The king is at (xk, yk).The rook can attack the king if there are no pieces between (xr, yk) and (xk, yk) in column yk.But the only pieces in column yk are the king and the moved rook (if xr is different from xk).If xr &lt; xk:The path from (xr, yk) to (xk, yk) is rows xr+1, xr+2, ..., xk-1, xk. The king is at xk. So, the path between xr and xk is clear if there are no other pieces in between. But since the king is at xk, the path is clear up to xk-1, but then the king is at xk, which is the target. So, the rook can attack the king.But the rook is at xr &lt; xk. The king is at xk. So, the path between xr and xk is clear (assuming no other pieces in between), so the rook can attack.Yes. Because for the rook to attack the king, the king is the target. The rook&#39;s line of sight ends at the king. So, even though the king is in the path, the rook can attack.So, the condition is that there are no other pieces between the rook&#39;s new position and the king.So, for example:Rook moves to (xr, yk). King is at (xk, yk). The path between them is column yk. If xr &lt; xk, then the squares between xr and xk in column yk are (xr+1, yk), (xr+2, yk), ..., (xk-1, yk). If these are all empty, then the path is clear, and the rook can attack the king.Similarly, if xr &gt; xk, then the squares between xk and xr must be empty.But the king is at (xk, yk), so the path between the rook and the king is clear if there are no other pieces in between.So, the steps for a rook to attack the king after moving to (xr, yk) are:   a. The rook can move to (xr, yk) from its original position (xr, yr) by moving along the row xr to column yk. This requires that the path from yr to yk is clear (no other pieces in row xr, columns between yr and yk).   b. The new position (xr, yk) is not occupied by any other piece.   c. The path between (xr, yk) and (xk, yk) in column yk is clear (no other pieces between xr and xk).   d. Also, the other rook&#39;s position (x2, y2) must not be in column yk (since the king is not under check initially, and the other rook&#39;s y2 is not yk).So, once the rook has moved to (xr, yk) and can attack the king, we need to check the adjacent squares.Now, for each adjacent square of the king:Check if it is attacked by either of the two rooks (moved rook or other rook).But the other rook is in its original position.So, for each adjacent square (nx, ny):   Check if the moved rook (xr, yk) can attack (nx, ny) via row or column, path clear.   Check if the other rook (x_other, y_other) can attack (nx, ny) via row or column, path clear.If any of these attacks is present, then the square is under attack.If a square is under attack, then the king can&#39;t move there.Additionally, if the square is occupied by a rook, the king can only move there if capturing the rook leaves him not in check.So, for example, if the square is occupied by the moved rook, then capturing it is possible only if the other rook does not attack that square.So, the algorithm for each possible moved rook is:After moving the rook to (xr, yk):   Check if the king is in check (i.e., the moved rook can attack him).   For each adjacent square of the king:      If the square is occupied by a rook (moved or other):         Check if the other rook attacks this square. If yes, then capturing is not allowed. If no, then the king can move here, so checkmate is not possible.      Else:         Check if the square is attacked by either rook. If yes, the king can&#39;t move here. If no, then he can, so checkmate is not possible.   If all squares are covered (king can&#39;t move to any), then checkmate is possible.So, this is the core of the algorithm.But how to implement this efficiently.Let&#39;s outline the steps for a single test case:Read king&#39;s position (xk, yk), rook1 (x1, y1), rook2 (x2, y2).For each rook (rook1 and rook2):   If the rook&#39;s original position is in the same column as the king (yr == yk), continue (since initial positions have king not under check, so this is impossible).   Else:      Check if the rook can move to (xr, yk) where xr is the original row of the rook.      To do this:         The rook&#39;s original position is (xr_orig, yr_orig).         To move to (xr_orig, yk), the path along the row xr_orig from yr_orig to yk must be clear (no other pieces between yr_orig and yk).         Also, the destination (xr_orig, yk) must not be occupied by the king or other rook.         Additionally, the path from (xr_orig, yk) to (xk, yk) in column yk must be clear (no other pieces between xr_orig and xk).      If all these conditions are met:         Then, after moving, the rook is at (xr_orig, yk), and can attack the king.         Now, check all adjacent squares of the king:         For each dx in [-1, 0, 1], dy in [-1, 0, 1], except (0, 0):            nx = xk + dx            ny = yk + dy            if nx &lt; 1 or nx &gt; 8 or ny &lt; 1 or ny &gt; 8:               continue (invalid square)            if (nx, ny) is occupied by a rook:               other_rook = rook2 if the moved rook is rook1, and vice versa.               Check if other_rook attacks (nx, ny) in the new positions.               If other_rook attacks (nx, ny), then capturing is not allowed (because after capturing, the king is in (nx, ny), which is attacked by other_rook).               So, the king can&#39;t move there.               Else, the king can move there, so checkmate is not possible.            else:               check if (nx, ny) is attacked by either the moved rook or the other rook.               If yes, then the king can&#39;t move there.               else, the king can move there, so checkmate is not possible.         If all adjacent squares are covered (king can&#39;t move to any), then checkmate is possible. Return YES.If any of the rooks allows such a move, return YES.Else, after checking all possibilities, return NO.Now, let&#39;s implement this in Python.But we need to handle T up to 1.6e5. So, the code must be efficient.So, the steps to implement:For each test case:   Read xk, yk.   Read x1, y1.   Read x2, y2.   For each rook in [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2) ]:      Check if the rook can move to (xr, yk), where xr is the rook&#39;s original x-coordinate.      This is because moving along the row to column yk.      Check:         1. The rook&#39;s original position is (xr, yr).         2. The destination (xr, yk) is not occupied by any other piece.            So, (xr, yk) must not be (xk, yk), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), or the other rook&#39;s position.         3. The path from (xr, yr) to (xr, yk) in row xr is clear. That is, no pieces between yr and yk in row xr.            To check this:               The columns between yr and yk must be empty except for other pieces.               For example, if yr &lt; yk:                  Then, in row xr, columns from yr+1 to yk-1 must be empty (no king or other rook).               Similarly for yr &gt; yk.               Also, the other rook&#39;s position (x_other, y_other) must not be in row xr and between yr and yk.               And the king&#39;s position (xk, yk) is in row xr? No, because the king&#39;s column is yk, which is part of the rook&#39;s new column.               Wait, no. The king is at (xk, yk). The rook&#39;s new position is (xr, yk). So, the king&#39;s row is xk, not xr. So, the king&#39;s position is not in row xr.               So, the only possible pieces in row xr are the other rook and the king.               But the other rook is at (x_other, y_other), which is not in row xr (since the two rooks are at different positions). Unless both rooks are in the same row, but initially, they are placed on different squares.               But in any case, the path is clear if between yr and yk in row xr there are no other pieces.         4. The path from (xr, yk) to (xk, yk) in column yk is clear. That is, no pieces between xr and xk in column yk.            For example, if xr &lt; xk:               Then, rows from xr+1 to xk-1 in column yk must be empty.               Also, the other rook&#39;s position must not be in column yk (which is guaranteed since initial positions have the king not under check).               The king is at (xk, yk), which is the end of the path. So, no need to check beyond xk.      If all these conditions are met, then proceed to check the adjacent squares.      For the adjacent squares:         For each dx in [-1, 0, 1], dy in [-1, 0, 1], except (0,0):            nx = xk + dx            ny = yk + dy            if nx &lt; 1 or nx &gt;8 or ny &lt;1 or ny&gt;8:               continue            is_occupied = (nx, ny) == (xr, yk) or (nx, ny) == (other_rook_x, other_rook_y)            if is_occupied:               # check if the other rook is attacking (nx, ny)               other_rook_pos = other_rook_x, other_rook_y               # check if other_rook_pos attacks (nx, ny)               # check if other_rook is in the same row or column as (nx, ny)               # and path is clear.               attack = False               if other_rook_x == nx:                  # same row                  min_col = min(ny, other_rook_y)                  max_col = max(ny, other_rook_y)                  # check if path is clear between (other_rook_x, min_col+1) to (other_rook_x, max_col-1)                  # if no pieces in between, then attack is possible.                  # check if any piece is in the same row and between min_col and max_col.                  # the other pieces are the king (xk, yk) and the moved rook (xr, yk)                  # So, check if king is in this row and in between.                  # king&#39;s position is (xk, yk). If other_rook_x == xk, then in this row.                  # but other_rook is not in the same column as king.                  # So, other_rook_x is not xk, since king is not under check.                  # So, the other_rook_x != xk.                  # So, the king is in a different row.                  # So, the only possible pieces in the same row as other_rook_x and between min_col and max_col are the moved rook.                  # but the moved rook is at (xr, yk), which is in a different row (xr) than other_rook_x (assuming other_rook_x is different from xr).                  # So, path is clear if there are no pieces in between.                  # So, check:                  # if ny == other_rook_y: same square, so attack is yes.                  # else:                     # check if between min_col and max_col, in row other_rook_x, there are no pieces.                     # pieces are king, other rook, moved rook.                     # king is in (xk, yk), other_rook_x != xk.                     # moved rook is in (xr, yk), other_rook_x != xr (since rook1 and rook2 are different).                     # So, no pieces in between.                     # So, attack is possible.                  # So, attack is True.                  # But wait, other_rook is at (other_rook_x, other_rook_y), which is the other rook&#39;s original position.                  # So, if other_rook_x == nx (same row), then other_rook is in the same row as (nx, ny).                  # So, between other_rook&#39;s column other_rook_y and ny, there must be no pieces.                  # Pieces in this row are the moved rook and the king.                  # moved rook is at (xr, yk), which is in row xr != other_rook_x.                  # king is at xk != other_rook_x.                  # So, the path is clear.                  attack = True               elif other_rook_y == ny:                  # same column                  min_row = min(nx, other_rook_x)                  max_row = max(nx, other_rook_x)                  # check if any pieces are in this column between min_row and max_row.                  # pieces are king (xk, yk), moved rook (xr, yk), other_rook (other_rook_x, other_rook_y).                  # since other_rook is in column other_rook_y, which is != ny (since other_rook_y is not yk, and ny is part of the king&#39;s adjacent squares, which are yk +/- 1 or same).                  # So, other_rook_y == ny only if other_rook is in the same column as the adjacent square, but the king&#39;s column is yk.                  # So, other_rook is not in the same column as the king.                  # So, if other_rook_y == ny, then the path between other_rook and (nx, ny) is clear.                  attack = True               else:                  attack = False               if attack:                  # after capturing, the king would be attacked by other_rook.

For example, checking the path between two points can be done with range checks.For example, to check if the path between (xr, yr) and (xr, yk) is clear:The columns are min(yr, yk) +1 to max(yr, yk) -1.If any of these columns in row xr are occupied by the king or other rook, the path is blocked.But the king is at (xk, yk), which is in a different row (since xk is not xr, because the king is not under check initially).The other rook is at (x_other, y_other). So, if x_other == xr and y_other is between yr and yk, then the path is blocked.So, the check can be:min_col = min(yr, yk)max_col = max(yr, yk)other_rook is (x_other, y_other)if x_other == xr and min_col &lt; y_other &lt; max_col:   path is blocked.elif the king is in row xr (which is impossible, since xk != xr):   path is blocked.else:   path is clear.Similarly for other checks.This way, we can avoid looping and use direct comparisons.So, let&#39;s rewrite the path checks.For the rook to move along its row xr to column yk:The path is clear if:   other_rook is not in row xr between yr and yk.   and the king is not in row xr (which he isn&#39;t).So, other_rook&#39;s position (x_other, y_other):if x_other == xr and (min(yr, yk) &lt; y_other &lt; max(yr, yk)):   path is blocked.else:   path is clear.Similarly, the path between the moved rook and the king (same column):path is clear if:other_rook&#39;s x_other is not between xr and xk (since other_rook&#39;s column is not yk).But other_rook is in (x_other, y_other), which is not in column yk.So, the path between (xr, yk) and (xk, yk) in column yk is clear if:other_rook&#39;s x_other is not between xr and xk.But since other_rook&#39;s column is not yk, any other_rook&#39;s position in column yk would have y_other == yk, which is impossible because the initial positions have the king not under check.So, other_rook is not in column yk.So, the only possible obstacle in the path between (xr, yk) and (xk, yk) in column yk is the other_rook&#39;s position if x_other is between xr and xk and y_other == yk. But this is impossible.So, the path is always clear.Wait, no. The other_rook is not in column yk. So, the path between (xr, yk) and (xk, yk) in column yk is clear.But what about the king? The king is at (xk, yk). So, if xr &lt; xk, the path is from xr up to xk, which includes the king&#39;s position. So, the rook can attack the king as long as there are no other pieces between xr and xk.But the only other piece in column yk is the king himself. So, the path is clear.So, the path between the moved rook and the king is clear if xr and xk are in the same column yk, and there are no other pieces in between.But since the other_rook is not in column yk, the path is clear.So, the only condition is that xr and xk are in the same column, and the rook can move there.So, the code can be optimized as follows:For each rook (xr_orig, yr_orig):   If yr_orig == yk: continue (since the rook can&#39;t attack initially)   Check if the rook can move to (xr_orig, yk):      The path along row xr_orig from yr_orig to yk is clear:         min_col = min(yr_orig, yk)         max_col = max(yr_orig, yk)         other_rook_col = other_rook&#39;s y-coordinate.         other_rook_x = other_rook&#39;s x-coordinate.         if other_rook_x == xr_orig and (min_col &lt; other_rook_col &lt; max_col):             path is blocked.         else:             path is clear.      Also, the destination (xr_orig, yk) must not be occupied by the king or other_rook.         if (xr_orig, yk) in [(xk, yk), (x1, y1), (x2, y2)]:             invalid.      If path is clear and destination is free:          check path between (xr_orig, yk) and (xk, yk) in column yk.          other_rook&#39;s x-coordinate is x_other.          if x_other is between xr_orig and xk:              path is blocked.          else:              path is clear.          So, for xr_orig &lt; xk:              if other_rook_x is in (xr_orig+1, xk-1) and other_rook_y == yk:                  path is blocked.              but other_rook_y is not yk, so no.          So, the path is clear.          So, this step is always true.Thus, the code can be optimized to only check the row path.So, the steps are:For each rook:   if yr_orig == yk: continue.   xr = xr_orig.   destination (xr, yk).   check if destination is not occupied by king or other rook.   check if other_rook is in row xr, between yr_orig and yk.   if both conditions are met:       proceed.       check adjacent squares.Now, let&#39;s code this.In Python:For a test case, the code would look something like this:def solve():    import sys    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    idx = 0    T = int(input[idx])    idx +=1    for _ in range(T):        xk = int(input[idx])        yk = int(input[idx+1])        idx +=2        x1 = int(input[idx])        y1 = int(input[idx+1])        idx +=2        x2 = int(input[idx])        y2 = int(input[idx+1])        idx +=2        # Check for rook1        rook1_possible = False        # rook1 is (x1, y1)        # check if can move to (x1, yk)        dest_x, dest_y = x1, yk        # check if destination is not occupied by king or rook2        if (dest_x, dest_y) == (xk, yk) or (dest_x, dest_y) == (x2, y2) or (dest_x, dest_y) == (x1, y1):            pass        else:            #

Repeat similar steps for rook2        # ... (code omitted for brevity)        # If neither rook leads to checkmate, print &quot;NO&quot;        print(&quot;NO&quot;)This code outline is incomplete and has many optimizations to make, but it captures the general approach.The main steps are:- For each rook, check if it can move to the same column as the king.- For each such valid move, check all adjacent squares of the king.- If all squares are covered, return YES.- Otherwise, check the other rook.- If neither rook leads to checkmate, return NO.Given the complexity of the code and the time constraints, it&#39;s crucial to optimize the checks, perhaps by avoiding loops where possible and using direct comparisons.For example, when checking if a path is clear between two points, we can determine if any blocking pieces are present without iterating through all possible positions. For example, the path between (x1, y1) and (x1, yk) in row x1 is clear if the other rook is not in the same row and between y1 and yk.Similarly, for column checks.This way, we can avoid explicit loops and use logical conditions instead, which is much faster.Overall, implementing this code requires careful handling of all the conditions and ensuring efficiency for large T. The sample input shows that the code should return YES when the rook&#39;s move blocks all escape routes, and NO otherwise. By thoroughly checking all possible valid moves and their consequences, we can determine the correct answer.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if the white king can be checkmated by either of the two black rooks in exactly one move. The solution involves checking all possible valid moves for each rook and verifying if any of these moves result in the king being checkmated. Approach1. Check Valid Rook Moves: For each rook, determine if it can move to a position where it attacks the king. This requires the rook to move to the same column as the king with a clear path.2. Check Path Validity: Ensure the path from the rook&#39;s original position to the new position is clear and the destination is not occupied.3. Check Adjacent Squares: After moving a rook to a valid attacking position, check if all adjacent squares of the king are either under attack or occupied by a rook that cannot be captured without leaving the king in check.

For each rook, it checks if moving to a valid position that attacks the king results in all adjacent squares of the king being under attack or occupied by a rook that cannot be captured safely. If either rook can achieve this, the answer is &quot;YES&quot;; otherwise, it is &quot;NO&quot;.

Let&#39;s think about how to approach this.First, the problem is asking for two things: the maximum possible flow F and the minimum cost to achieve this flow. So, the steps probably are: compute the maximum flow, and then among all possible flows of that maximum size, find the one with the least cost. Or maybe it&#39;s that we need to compute the min cost flow where the flow is maximum. So it&#39;s a combination of max flow and min cost flow.Wait, but how are these two combined? Oh right, the standard approach is to use the Successive Shortest Paths algorithm with potentials (like the Bellman-Ford initially and then Dijkstra with potentials to handle the costs). Because for each unit of flow, we want to find the shortest (cheapest) augmenting path. By doing this for each unit until we can&#39;t send any more, we get the maximum flow with the minimum total cost.But wait, in some cases, the capacities are larger than 1. So each edge can carry multiple units. But here, each edge&#39;s capacity is up to 10000. So if we send each unit incrementally, that would be O(F) iterations where F could be up to sum of capacities, which could be 5000 edges each with 1e4 capacity, so F up to 5e7. That&#39;s way too big. So a Dijkstra-based approach with capacity handling is needed. So instead of sending one unit at a time, we find the shortest path and send as much as possible along that path.So the plan is to implement the Min-Cost Max-Flow algorithm using the capacity scaling or the successive shortest augmenting paths with Dijkstra and potentials. The correct approach here is to use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm but modified for costs, which is the Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA) for possible negative weights but with Dijkstra&#39;s using potentials to avoid negative edges.Alternatively, use the Successive Shortest Paths algorithm with Dijkstra and a potential function to handle the residual costs. Let&#39;s think about how that works.First, the residual graph is built. For each edge u-&gt;v with capacity c and cost w, the residual graph has a forward edge (u-&gt;v) with remaining capacity c and cost w, and a backward edge (v-&gt;u) with capacity 0 (initially) and cost -w. Then, each time we find the shortest path from s to t in the residual graph, considering the current potentials to adjust the edge costs to be non-negative. Then, we send as much flow as possible along that path (which is the minimum residual capacity along the path). We add the cost of this flow (flow * sum of the edge costs along the path) to the total. Repeat until no more augmenting paths exist.The key here is that each iteration uses Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm with a potential to manage the reduced costs. This avoids having negative edges, so Dijkstra can be used each time.So, the steps are:1. Build the residual graph. Each edge has a residual capacity and a cost. For each original edge (u, v, c, w), we add a forward edge to the adjacency list of u with capacity c and cost w, and a backward edge in the adjacency list of v with capacity 0 and cost -w.2. Initialize the potential function (like h[v] for each node v) to zero, or compute it via Bellman-Ford in the first iteration to handle possible negative cycles. Wait, but if the graph has no negative cycles (which it shouldn&#39;t, because the original edges have positive costs, and residual edges can have negative only for backward edges). But in the first iteration, after the initial residual graph, are there any edges with negative cost? For example, if the original edges are all positive, then the forward edges have positive costs, backward edges have negative. So when we look for the shortest path, the first time, the path could involve backward edges, which have negative cost. So the initial potential (Bellman-Ford) may be needed to avoid negative edge costs. Hmm.Alternatively, since the graph may have edges with negative costs in the residual graph (from the backward edges), the first time we run Dijkstra, the adjusted costs (using potentials) need to be non-negative. So the potential function is maintained such that for any edge (u, v), the adjusted cost is cost + h[u] - h[v] &gt;= 0. This is called the reduced cost.So each time after finding the shortest paths, the potentials are updated based on the distances found. The standard approach is to use the Bellman-Ford algorithm for the first iteration to compute the initial potentials, then use Dijkstra with the potentials for subsequent iterations.But since the initial graph may have negative edges, Bellman-Ford is needed once. Then, after that, Dijkstra can be used because the potentials maintain the reduced costs to be non-negative.So the overall approach is:- Initialize the flow and cost to 0.- Run Bellman-Ford to compute the initial potentials.- While there exists an augmenting path (s to t in the residual graph with capacity &gt;0):   - Use Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm with the potentials to find the shortest path in terms of the reduced cost.   - Update the potentials based on the distances found (h[v] += distance[v]).   - Find the minimum residual capacity along the augmenting path.   - Augment the flow by that amount.   - Add to the total cost the sum of the original edge costs along the path multiplied by the flow.But wait, how do we find the actual path? Or do we need to track the path&#39;s edges?Alternatively, in the Dijkstra step, for each node, we track the previous edge and the minimum residual capacity along the path. Then, once we reach t, we can backtrack from t to s, find the edges in the path, and determine the maximum flow possible (the min residual capacity along the path). Then, for each edge in the path, we reduce the residual capacity by the flow, and increase the reverse edge&#39;s capacity by the same amount.This sounds a bit involved. So, the data structure for the residual graph is important. Each edge in the residual graph can be represented as an object with to, rev (the reverse edge&#39;s index), capacity, and cost. Then, for each node u, we have an adjacency list of these edges.So, when building the residual graph:For each original edge (u, v, c, w):   add a forward edge from u to v with capacity c and cost w.   add a backward edge from v to u with capacity 0 and cost -w.Wait, but the backward edge is in v&#39;s adjacency list, and the reverse edge would point back to u&#39;s adjacency list. So each edge has a reverse edge in the residual graph.So when we send flow along an edge, we subtract from its capacity and add to the reverse edge&#39;s capacity.So the steps for the algorithm are:Initialize the residual graph with all original edges and their reverse edges.Compute initial potentials with Bellman-Ford.While True:   Compute the shortest path from s to t in the residual graph using Dijkstra with potentials.   If no path exists, break.   Compute the minimum residual capacity along the path.   Augment the flow by this amount.   Update the residual capacities along the path.   Update the total cost.   Update the potentials using the distances from Dijkstra.Wait, but how are the potentials updated? The potential h[v] is the shortest distance from s to v in the previous iterations. Or maybe, after each Dijkstra run, h is updated as h[v] += d[v], where d[v] is the distance found in this Dijkstra run. This is part of the technique to maintain non-negative reduced costs.Alternatively, the potential is maintained as the sum of previous distances. Let me think. The idea is that the reduced cost for an edge (u, v) is cost + h[u] - h[v]. Then, after running Dijkstra and finding new distances d, the new potential h&#39;[v] = h[v] + d[v]. This way, the next Dijkstra will use the updated potentials, ensuring that the reduced costs are non-negative.So, during the Dijkstra step, the edge weights are the original cost plus the current potential of u minus the potential of v. This way, the adjusted costs are non-negative, allowing Dijkstra to work.But how does that ensure that the adjusted costs are non-negative? Let&#39;s see. Suppose in the first iteration, after Bellman-Ford, the potentials h are the shortest paths considering all edges. Then, during Dijkstra, the adjusted cost for edge (u, v) is w_uv + h[u] - h[v]. Since h[v] &lt;= h[u] + w_uv (by the triangle inequality from Bellman-Ford), this adjusted cost is &gt;=0.So in subsequent steps, when we run Dijkstra again with the updated potentials, the adjusted costs remain non-negative.So the algorithm is:1. Run Bellman-Ford to compute initial potentials h.2. While there&#39;s an augmenting path:   a. Run Dijkstra using the adjusted costs (w_uv + h[u] - h[v]).   b. If no path found, break.   c. Compute the min residual capacity on the path.   d. Update flow and cost.   e. Update the potentials h[v] += d[v], where d[v] is the distance from s to v in the current Dijkstra run.So, the key part is the Dijkstra step with the adjusted costs and the potential updates.Now, the question is: How to implement this in Python efficiently.But for Python, with m up to 5000 and n up to 250, and each Dijkstra being O(m + n log n), and the number of augmentations being O(F), which could be up to 1e7, but with capacity scaling (sending as much as possible each time), the number of iterations would be O(m log U), where U is the maximum capacity. Wait, but in this problem, each edge has capacity up to 1e4, but the maximum flow could be up to (sum of all capacities from s), so that&#39;s 5e4 * 1e4 = 5e8, which is way too large for Python to handle with a O(F) algorithm. So we need a more efficient approach.Wait, but the standard min-cost max-flow algorithm with capacity scaling (sending flow in batches) is better. However, implementing capacity scaling can be a bit complex.Alternatively, since each edge&#39;s capacity can be up to 1e4, but in the problem statement, we need to find the maximum possible flow and the minimum cost for that flow. So for each augmenting path, we can send the maximum possible flow along that path, which is the minimum residual capacity on the path. So each time we find a path, we send as much as possible. That reduces the number of iterations from O(F) to O(m) per augmenting path. Wait, but in the worst case, the number of augmenting paths is O(mU), where U is the maximum capacity. But if U is 1e4, then m is 5e3, that&#39;s 5e7 steps, which is still too much for Python.Hmm. So perhaps the standard successive shortest augmenting path algorithm with Dijkstra and potentials is not efficient enough for Python for the given constraints. But let&#39;s see the sample inputs. For example, the second sample has m=1 and the capacity is 1000. So the algorithm would send 1000 units in each iteration, but how? Because each iteration would find the same path (the only edge), and send 1000 units at once. So in that case, it&#39;s O(1) iterations.So the key is that in each iteration, after finding the shortest path, we send as much as possible along that path. So the number of iterations is O(m * log U) if we use capacity scaling, but without capacity scaling, it&#39;s O(F), which is not feasible for large F.But in this problem, the maximum F can be up to the sum of all capacities from s. For example, if s has edges with capacity 1e4 each, and there are 5e3 edges, then sum could be up to 5e7. But handling that in Python is impossible with O(F) iterations.So, perhaps the correct approach here is to use the Successive Shortest Path algorithm with Dijkstra and potentials, but in each iteration, send as much flow as possible along the shortest path.Wait, but how to compute how much flow can be sent along the path. For that, we need to find the minimum residual capacity on the path, which is the bottleneck. Then send that amount. So each iteration sends delta flow, which can be up to the minimum residual capacity.So in each iteration, we send delta = min residual capacity along the path. Then, the total flow is incremented by delta, and the cost is delta multiplied by the sum of the edge costs along the path.So the number of iterations is the number of augmenting paths found, each sending some delta. For example, in the first sample input, delta would be 4 (since the maximum flow is 4, and perhaps there&#39;s a path that allows sending all 4 at once). So the algorithm would take 1 iteration.In the second sample, the path allows sending 1000 units in one iteration.So the key is to send as much as possible each time, which reduces the number of iterations. But in the worst case, like when each augmenting path can send only 1 unit, then the algorithm will take O(F) steps, which is not feasible for large F.But given that the problem states that F can be up to less than 2^31, which is up to 2e9, but Python can handle that? No, because even 1e6 iterations would take too long.So for this problem, perhaps the correct approach is to use the standard min-cost max-flow algorithm with Dijkstra and potentials, and hope that it&#39;s efficient enough for the given constraints.Alternatively, maybe the test cases are designed such that this approach works.So, the steps to implement:Implement the residual graph using adjacency lists. Each edge has a to, rev (the reverse edge index), capacity, cost.Implement the Bellman-Ford for the initial potential.Wait, but Bellman-Ford is O(nm), which for n=250 and m=5e3 would be 250*5e3=1.25e6 operations. That&#39;s manageable.Then, for each iteration, run Dijkstra using a priority queue, with the adjusted costs (current cost + h[u] - h[v]). Then, for each edge in the path, compute the minimum residual capacity, then augment that delta.So code structure:Read n, m, s, t.Build the residual graph.Add each original edge as a forward edge (capacity c, cost w) and a backward edge (capacity 0, cost -w).Compute initial potentials using Bellman-Ford.Initialize flow = 0, cost = 0.Loop:   Run Dijkstra to find the shortest path from s to t using the adjusted costs (h[u] + cost of edge - h[v]).   If no path exists, break.   Get the distance to t (d[t]).   If d[t] is infinity, break.   Compute the delta as the minimum residual capacity along the path.   Also, compute the actual cost of the path (sum of the original edge costs) because delta * sum is added to the total cost.Wait, no. The actual cost for the path is the sum of the original edge costs. Because each edge in the residual graph may have a cost that&#39;s adjusted by the potentials, but the actual cost per unit flow is the original cost. So when we send delta flow, the total cost increases by delta * sum of the original edge costs along the path.But how to compute this sum? Because in the Dijkstra step, we track the distance, which is the sum of adjusted costs. But the actual cost is the sum of the original costs.Hmm. So perhaps during the Dijkstra run, for each node, we can track both the adjusted distance (for the priority queue) and the actual cost (sum of original edge costs along the path).Alternatively, when backtracking the path, we can iterate through the edges in the path and sum their original costs.But how to track the path. Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm gives us the distances and predecessors, but storing the entire path can be memory-intensive. So for each node, we track the predecessor edge. Then, once we reach t, we can backtrack from t to s, collecting the edges along the path. Then, for each edge in the path, we can subtract delta from the capacity and add delta to the reverse edge&#39;s capacity. Also, sum their original costs to compute delta * sum.Yes. So, during Dijkstra&#39;s run, for each node, we track the predecessor edge. Then, when we reach t, we can backtrack through the predecessors to find the path.So, the steps in code:For each iteration:   Run Dijkstra, tracking for each node the previous edge and the minimum residual capacity along the path.   If t is unreachable, break.   Compute delta as the min residual capacity along the path.   Update flow += delta.   Update cost += delta * (sum of the original edge costs along the path).   For each edge in the path, subtract delta from its capacity and add delta to the reverse edge&#39;s capacity.   Update the potentials: for each node v, h[v] += d[v], where d[v] is the distance from s to v in the current Dijkstra step.But how to compute the sum of the original edge costs along the path. Each edge in the residual graph has a cost. But when we send flow along a forward edge, the original cost is the edge&#39;s cost. If we send flow along a backward edge (which is a reverse of a forward edge), then the original cost is the negative of the reverse edge&#39;s cost. Wait, because the reverse edge&#39;s cost is the negative of the original edge&#39;s cost. So when you send flow through a backward edge (which represents reducing the flow in the original forward edge), the cost is subtracted.But during the path traversal, when you use a forward edge, the actual cost is the edge&#39;s cost. When you use a backward edge (reverse edge), the actual cost is the original edge&#39;s cost, but since you are sending flow in the reverse direction (undoing flow), the cost is subtracted. Wait, no: the residual graph&#39;s backward edge has cost -w. So when you send flow through a backward edge (which allows you to decrease the flow in the original forward edge), you gain back the cost. So for each unit of flow sent through a backward edge, the cost decreases by w.So the sum of the original costs along the path in the residual graph is the sum of the original edges&#39; costs for forward edges and the negative of the original edges&#39; costs for backward edges.Wait, perhaps not. Because in the residual graph, the forward edge&#39;s cost is the same as the original edge&#39;s cost. The backward edge&#39;s cost is the negative of the original edge&#39;s cost. So when you send flow through a forward edge, you pay the original cost. When you send flow through a backward edge (which is a reverse of some original edge), you pay the backward edge&#39;s cost, which is -original cost. So the sum of the edges in the residual path gives the total cost per unit flow.But the sum of the residual edges&#39; costs along the path is exactly the total cost per unit flow. So for each unit of flow sent along that path, the cost increases by that sum. So delta multiplied by that sum is the total cost added.Wait, but in the code, the residual edges&#39; costs are already adjusted by the potentials. But the actual cost per unit flow is the sum of the original edge costs along the path. How is that connected?Wait, the residual edges&#39; costs are the actual cost per unit flow. Because when you send flow through a forward edge, you pay the original cost. When you send flow through a backward edge, you pay the reverse edge&#39;s cost (which is negative of the original). So the sum of the residual edges&#39; costs along the path is the actual cost per unit flow.But in the Dijkstra step, the algorithm uses the adjusted costs (w_uv + h[u] - h[v]). However, when we compute the actual cost, we need to sum the original w_uv of the edges in the path. But how?Wait, the residual edge&#39;s cost is the original cost. For example:Original edge u-&gt;v has cost w. The forward residual edge (u, v) has cost w. The backward residual edge (v, u) has cost -w.So when you send flow through the forward edge, you pay w per unit. When you send flow through the backward edge, you pay -w per unit.So the actual cost per unit flow sent along the path is the sum of the residual edges&#39; costs along the path.But the sum that Dijkstra computes uses the adjusted costs (w_uv + h[u] - h[v]). So the distance d[t] (sum of adjusted costs) is equal to sum (w_uv + h[u] - h[v]) for edges in the path. But the actual sum of the original w_uv is sum (w_uv) = (d[t] - (h[s] - h[t]))). Because h[s] is the initial potential of s, and h[t] is the initial potential of t. Wait, the path starts at s and ends at t. So the sum of adjusted costs is sum (w_uv + h[u] - h[v]) for each edge in the path. That sum is equal to sum w_uv + sum (h[u] - h[v]). The sum of h[u] - h[v] over the path is h[s] - h[t], because the path is s -&gt; u1 -&gt; u2 ... -&gt; t. So each h[u] is subtracted once when leaving u, and added once when entering u. Except for the start and end. So the sum is h[s] - h[t].Thus, sum adjusted = sum w_uv + h[s] - h[t]. But sum adjusted is d[t], the distance found by Dijkstra. So sum w_uv = d[t] - h[s] + h[t].But h[s] is initially 0, but after the first iteration, h is updated. Wait, no. The potentials h are updated each iteration. So in each iteration, the sum adjusted is sum (w_uv + h_old[u] - h_old[v]). Then, the distance d[v] is the sum of the adjusted costs. Then, the new h is h_new[v] = h_old[v] + d[v]. So after the iteration, the sum of the original w_uv is d[t] - (h_old[s] - h_old[t])).But since h_old[s] is the previous potential of s, and h_old[t] is the previous potential of t. However, in each iteration, s is the source, so during the Dijkstra step, d[s] is zero. Because when you start with s, the distance to s is zero. So in the adjusted costs, the distance to s is zero.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the actual cost of the path is simply the sum of the residual edges&#39; costs along the path, which can be computed by summing the residual edges&#39; cost as we backtrack along the path.So during the backtracking phase, once we have the path, we can collect all the edges in the path and sum their costs, which gives the actual cost per unit flow.Thus, during the path extraction step:current_node = tsum_cost = 0while current_node != s:   edge = predecessor_edge[current_node]   sum_cost += edge.cost   current_node = edge.rev.to  # Because each edge&#39;s reverse is stored, and the reverse&#39;s &#39;to&#39; is the previous node.Wait, perhaps. So each edge in the residual graph has a &#39;rev&#39; which is the reverse edge. For example, for a forward edge (u-&gt;v), the reverse is (v-&gt;u). So when you take edge (u-&gt;v), the reverse edge is part of v&#39;s adjacency list. So to backtrack the path, for each edge in the path (which is pointing to the current node), the previous node would be the &#39;from&#39; of the reverse edge.Alternatively, perhaps during Dijkstra, for each node v, we track the predecessor edge (the edge that was used to reach v). So, for each edge in the predecessor path, we can collect the edges. For example, if the predecessor of v is the edge e (which is u-&gt;v), then the path to v is path to u followed by e.Thus, to get the path, we start at t, then for each step, we take the predecessor edge of t, then the predecessor of u, etc., until we reach s.So in code:path = []v = twhile v != s:   e = prev_edge[v]   path.append(e)   v = e.rev.to  # Because e is the edge that leads to v, so the reverse edge&#39;s &#39;to&#39; is the previous node.Then, reverse the path to get it from s to t.Once we have the path, we can iterate through each edge and sum their costs. Then, delta multiplied by this sum is added to the total cost.So, the code steps are:sum_cost = 0for e in path:   sum_cost += e.costcost += delta * sum_costYes. That would correctly account for the actual cost per unit flow.So, the code needs to:- For each iteration:   Run Dijkstra to find the shortest path (using adjusted costs) and track predecessors.   If no path, break.   Extract the path by backtracking from t to s using the predecessors.   Compute delta as the minimum residual capacity along the path.   sum_cost is sum of the edges&#39; costs in the path.   Update total flow and cost.   Update residual capacities.   Update potentials.Now, how to implement this in Python.First, the residual graph. Each edge is represented as an object. But in Python, perhaps using a list of adjacency lists, each entry containing the edge&#39;s to, rev (the index of the reverse edge), capacity, and cost.Wait, perhaps the standard way is to represent the residual graph as an adjacency list, where for each node u, adj[u] is a list of Edge objects. Each Edge has:- to: the node it points to.- rev: the index of the reverse edge in adj[to].- capacity: remaining capacity.- cost: the cost of the edge.So, when adding an edge from u to v with capacity c and cost w, we create an Edge object in adj[u], and its reverse Edge in adj[v].So code for adding edges:def add_edge(u, v, c, w):    adj[u].append(Edge(v, len(adj[v]), c, w))    adj[v].append(Edge(u, len(adj[u])-1, 0, -w))But in Python, perhaps using a class for the edges. But for efficiency, perhaps use a list of dictionaries or tuples.But for clarity, perhaps using a class:class Edge:    def __init__(self, to, rev, capacity, cost):        self.to = to        self.rev = rev        self.capacity = capacity        self.cost = costThen, the adjacency list is a list of lists of Edge objects.So, for each original edge (u, v, c, w):add_edge(u, v, c, w)add_edge(v, u, 0, -w)  # No, wait, the reverse edge is added automatically in the add_edge function.Wait, no. The add_edge function creates both the forward and backward edges.Wait, the function add_edge(u, v, c, w) adds a forward edge from u to v with capacity c and cost w, and a backward edge from v to u with capacity 0 and cost -w.So, the code for add_edge is:def add_edge(u, v, c, w):    # Forward edge: u-&gt;v    forward = Edge(v, len(adj[v]), c, w)    # Backward edge: v-&gt;u    backward = Edge(u, len(adj[u]), 0, -w)    adj[u].append(forward)    adj[v].append(backward)Wait, but the &#39;rev&#39; parameter of the forward edge is len(adj[v]) before the backward edge is added. Because after adding the forward edge to adj[u], the backward edge is added to adj[v]. Then, the reverse of the forward edge is the index of the backward edge in adj[v]. Which is len(adj[v]) - 1 (since we just appended it). But in the code above, when creating the forward edge, the rev is len(adj[v]), which would be the index of the backward edge once it&#39;s added. Because adj[v] has len L, then after appending the backward edge, its index is L.Wait, let&#39;s see:Initially, adj[v] has length L.We create the forward edge with rev parameter len(adj[v]) (which is L), and append it to adj[u].Then, we create the backward edge with rev parameter len(adj[u]) (which is the index of the forward edge in adj[u]).Then, append the backward edge to adj[v]. So the backward edge is at index L in adj[v], which is the same as the forward edge&#39;s rev parameter.So the code is correct.Yes. So the Edge object for the forward edge has rev = index of the backward edge in adj[v], and the backward edge has rev = index of the forward edge in adj[u].This way, for any edge, e.rev refers to the reverse edge, which can be accessed via adj[e.to][e.rev].Now, the Bellman-Ford step. We need to compute the initial potentials h.Initialize h as [infinity] * n, except h[s] = 0.Then, relax all edges m times.But Bellman-Ford can be implemented as follows:h = [inf] * nh[s] = 0for _ in range(n):    updated = False    for u in range(n):        if h[u] == inf:            continue        for e in adj[u]:            if e.capacity &gt; 0 and h[e.to] &gt; h[u] + e.cost:                h[e.to] = h[u] + e.cost                updated = True    if not updated:        breakBut since the graph may have negative cycles, but in the original graph, there are no negative cycles, because the original edges have positive cost. However, the residual graph could have negative edges. But in the initial residual graph, the only edges with cost are:forward edges have cost w (positive), backward edges have cost -w (negative). So the initial residual graph may have edges with negative cost, but since we&#39;re finding the shortest paths from s to all other nodes, Bellman-Ford can be used once here.But the Bellman-Ford algorithm may not find the shortest paths if there&#39;s a negative cycle reachable from s. However, in the original problem, the flow is feasible, so there must be no negative cycles in the residual graph when the flow is zero. Because the original edges have positive costs, and the backward edges (which are added when there&#39;s flow) have zero capacity. So in the initial state, the backward edges are not present (their capacity is zero). So the initial residual graph consists of forward edges with positive cost, which can&#39;t form a negative cycle.Wait, the initial residual graph only has edges with positive cost (forward edges) and backward edges with negative cost but zero capacity. So the Bellman-Ford algorithm can proceed, but the only edges that can be used are the forward edges (since backward edges have zero capacity and can&#39;t be traversed). So the initial h is computed correctly via Bellman-Ford, but since all edges are forward edges with positive cost, the h computed would be the shortest path via the original edges.But perhaps this is unnecessary, and the initial h can be set to zero. But according to the theory, the initial potentials should be set via Bellman-Ford to handle possible negative edges in the residual graph. But in the initial residual graph, the only edges with capacity are the forward edges (with positive cost). The backward edges have zero capacity, so they can&#39;t be used. So the initial h can be computed via Dijkstra as well, but since there are no negative edges, but that&#39;s not possible because the initial edges could have any cost.Wait, the original edges can have any cost as per the problem statement (w can be up to 1e3, but positive). So the initial residual graph&#39;s edges (forward edges) have positive cost, so Dijkstra can be used for the initial h. But why is Bellman-Ford necessary? Because there&#39;s no negative edges in the initial residual graph. So perhaps the initial h can be computed via Dijkstra. But that would require a priority queue. So why use Bellman-Ford here?Ah, no. The initial potentials need to be the shortest distances from s in the residual graph, considering all edges (including backward edges, but with capacity zero, so they can&#39;t be traversed). So the initial residual graph only has forward edges (with capacity c &gt;=1, cost w &gt;=1). So the initial h can be computed via Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm. But why use Bellman-Ford here? Because in the initial residual graph, all edges have positive cost. So Dijkstra can compute the initial h.But according to some sources, the initial h can be all zeros, but then the first Dijkstra run may have negative edges. Wait, no: the adjusted cost is cost + h[u] - h[v]. So if h is all zeros, then the adjusted cost is the same as the original cost. If the first iteration uses edges with positive cost, then Dijkstra can proceed. But in the initial residual graph, all edges are forward edges with positive cost. So why run Bellman-Ford? Because in the first iteration, the Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm can be used directly.But according to the theory, the initial h can be computed with Bellman-Ford once to handle possible negative edges in the residual graph. But in our case, the initial residual graph has no negative edges (forward edges have positive cost, backward edges have negative but zero capacity). So perhaps the initial h can be computed via Dijkstra once.So maybe the code can replace the Bellman-Ford with a Dijkstra run for the initial h.But perhaps the Bellman-Ford is easier to implement in code, given that we need to compute the shortest paths from s, even with possible negative edges. But since the initial residual graph&#39;s edges are all forward edges with positive cost, Dijkstra is feasible.But to handle the general case, the Bellman-Ford is required. For example, if the residual graph has negative edges with capacity &gt;0 (which would be the case after some iterations when backward edges are added with capacity), then Dijkstra can&#39;t be used without potentials. But the initial step can&#39;t have any such edges, so the initial h can be computed via Dijkstra.Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe it&#39;s easier to proceed with the Bellman-Ford code for the initial h.So, in code:n, m, s, t = map(int, input().split())adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]for _ in range(m):    u, v, c, w = map(int, input().split())    add_edge(u, v, c, w)Then, compute initial h via Bellman-Ford:h = [float(&#39;inf&#39;)] * nh[s] = 0for _ in range(n):    updated = False    for u in range(n):        if h[u] == float(&#39;inf&#39;):            continue        for e in adj[u]:            if e.capacity &gt; 0 and h[e.to] &gt; h[u] + e.cost:                h[e.to] = h[u] + e.cost                updated = True    if not updated:        breakThen, proceed with the main loop.In the main loop:flow = 0cost = 0while True:    # Run Dijkstra using the adjusted cost (cost + h[u] - h[v])    dist = [float(&#39;inf&#39;)] * n    dist[s] = 0    prev = [None] * n    min_cap = [float(&#39;inf&#39;)] * n    # Use a priority queue (heapq)    import heapq    heap = []    heapq.heappush(heap, (0, s))    while heap:        d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)        if d &gt; dist[u]:            continue        for e in adj[u]:            if e.capacity &gt; 0:                v = e.to                w = e.cost + h[u] - h[v]                if dist[v] &gt; d + w:                    dist[v] = d + w                    prev[v] = e                    min_cap[v] = min(min_cap[u], e.capacity)                    heapq.heappush(heap, (dist[v], v))    if dist[t] == float(&#39;inf&#39;):        break  # No more augmenting paths    # Compute delta    delta = min_cap[t]    # Update flow and cost    # First, find the path and sum the original edge costs    path = []    v = t    sum_cost = 0    while v != s:        e = prev[v]        path.append(e)        v = e.rev.to    path.reverse()    # Sum the cost of the path edges    sum_cost = sum(e.cost for e in path)    # Update flow and cost    flow += delta    cost += delta * sum_cost    # Update residual capacities    for e in path:        e.capacity -= delta        adj[e.to][e.rev].capacity += delta    # Update potentials    for i in range(n):        if dist[i] != float(&#39;inf&#39;):            h[i] += dist[i]So, the code above should work. Let&#39;s test it against the sample inputs.Sample Input 1:4 4 0 30 1 4 101 2 2 100 2 4 302 3 4 10The residual graph after adding all edges:Edges for 0:- 0-&gt;1, capacity 4, cost 10. Reverse is 1-&gt;0, capacity 0, cost -10.- 0-&gt;2, capacity 4, cost 30. Reverse is 2-&gt;0, capacity 0, cost -30.Edges for 1:- 1-&gt;2, capacity 2, cost 10. Reverse is 2-&gt;1, capacity 0, cost -10.- reverse edges of 0-&gt;1 and others.The initial Bellman-Ford will compute h as the shortest paths from 0.The shortest path from 0 to 3: in the initial residual graph, the path 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3. The capacity of 0-&gt;1 is 4, 1-&gt;2 is 2, 2-&gt;3 is 4. The min capacity is 2, so delta is 2. But after sending 2 units, the edges 0-&gt;1&#39;s capacity becomes 2, 1-&gt;2 becomes 0 (so its reverse has capacity 2), 2-&gt;3 becomes 2.Then, the potentials are updated.Wait, but according to the sample output, the maximum flow is 4. So the algorithm needs to find multiple augmenting paths.Hmm. So the first iteration sends 2 units, then another iteration finds another path.Wait, perhaps the code isn&#39;t handling the case where after sending delta along the path, there&#39;s another path available.But let&#39;s see.In the first iteration:After Bellman-Ford, the initial h is computed. The shortest paths from s=0 are:h[0] = 0h[1] = 10 (from 0-&gt;1)h[2] = 30 (from 0-&gt;2) or via 0-&gt;1-&gt;2 (10 + 10 = 20). So during Bellman-Ford, the first iteration:For u=0, edges to 1 and 2.h[1] = min(inf, 0 + 10) = 10.h[2] = min(inf, 0 +30) =30.Then, for u=1, edges to 2 (capacity 2, cost 10). So h[2] can be updated to 10 +10 =20.So after the first Bellman-Ford iteration, h[2] is 20.After another iteration, u=2, but edges to 3 (capacity 4, cost 10). So h[3] is min(inf, 20 +10) =30.Then, after the third iteration (since n=4), it&#39;s possible that other nodes are relaxed.So the initial h after Bellman-Ford would be:h = [0, 10, 20, 30]Then, in the first Dijkstra run:adjusted cost for edge 0-&gt;1: 10 + 0 (h[0]) -10 (h[1]) = 0.adjusted cost for edge 0-&gt;2:30 +0 -20 =10.adjusted cost for 1-&gt;2:10 +10 (h[1]) -20 (h[2}) =0.So the path 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3 would have adjusted costs:0 (0-&gt;1) +0 (1-&gt;2) + 10 (2-&gt;3&#39;s adjusted cost is 10 + h[2] -h[3] = 10 +20 -30=0.So the adjusted cost for 2-&gt;3 is 10 +20 -30 =0.So the adjusted cost for the path 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3 is 0+0+0=0. But dist[t=3] is 0.But in the code, the Dijkstra would find this path.The minimum capacity along this path is 4 (0-&gt;1 has capacity 4, 1-&gt;2 has 2, 2-&gt;3 has4. So min is 2. So delta is 2.But then the code sends 2 units, adding 2*(10+10+10) = 60 to the cost.Then, the code updates the capacities. Edge 0-&gt;1&#39;s capacity becomes 4-2=2. Edge 1-&gt;2&#39;s capacity becomes 2-2=0. Edge 2-&gt;3&#39;s capacity becomes4-2=2.Then, the code updates the potentials. The dist array for this iteration is:dist[0] =0, dist[1] =0 (because adjusted cost of 0-&gt;1 is 0), dist[2] =0 (0-&gt;1-&gt;2, adjusted cost 0+0=0), dist[3] =0 (0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3, adjusted cost 0+0+0=0).So h becomes [0+0, 10+0, 20+0, 30+0] = [0, 10, 20, 30] (no change).Then, in the next iteration, Dijkstra is run again. Now, the adjusted costs:For edge 0-&gt;1: cost is 10 + h[0] -h[1] =10 +0 -10 =0.Capacity is 2.Edge 0-&gt;2:30 +0 -20=10.Edge 1-&gt;2: the forward edge has capacity 0 now, so can&#39;t be used. The backward edge (2-&gt;1) has capacity 2 (from previous step). Its cost is -10. The adjusted cost is -10 + h[2] - h[1} = -10 +20 -10=0. So if the path uses this backward edge, but how.But in this iteration, the path could be 0-&gt;2-&gt;3. The edges 0-&gt;2 has capacity 4, cost 30. The adjusted cost for 0-&gt;2 is 30 +0 (h[0]) -20 (h[2})=10. Then, the edge 2-&gt;3 has capacity 2, cost 10. Adjusted cost is 10 +20 (h[2}) -30 (h[3}) =0.So the path 0-&gt;2-&gt;3 has adjusted cost 10 +0=10. But maybe there&#39;s a better path.Alternatively, perhaps the code finds another path using the backward edges.But after sending 2 units via 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3, the residual capacities are:Edge 0-&gt;1: 2.Edge 1-&gt;2: 0.Edge 2-&gt;3: 2.But the reverse edges (backward) for 1-&gt;2 now have capacity 2. So the backward edge is 2-&gt;1 with capacity 2, cost -10.So in the next iteration, maybe the path is 0-&gt;1 (capacity 2) -&gt;2 via the reverse edge (2-&gt;1? No, because the forward edge from 1-&gt;2 has capacity 0. But the backward edge from 2-&gt;1 has capacity 2. But in the residual graph, the edge 2-&gt;1 is part of the adjacency list of 2. So during the Dijkstra, the code may find a path that uses 0-&gt;1 (capacity 2), then 1-&gt;0 (reverse edge) is not possible since capacity is 0. Or maybe not.Wait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the sample input can be handled by the code.The first iteration sends 2 units via 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3. Then, the next iteration will find another path. Let&#39;s see.In the second iteration, the code runs Dijkstra again. The adjusted costs are computed using the updated potentials (which are the same as before, since dist was zero).The path could be 0-&gt;2-&gt;3. The capacity of 0-&gt;2 is 4, and 2-&gt;3 is 2. So delta is 2. Sum cost is 30 +10=40. So cost increases by 2*40=80. Total cost now is 60+80=140. Flow is 2+2=4. Then, 0-&gt;2&#39;s capacity becomes 4-2=2. 2-&gt;3&#39;s capacity becomes 0.But then, there&#39;s another path: 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3 is no longer available because 1-&gt;2&#39;s capacity is 0. But perhaps the code can find another path.Wait, but after two augmentations of 2 units each, the total flow is 4, which matches the sample output. So the code should output flow 4 and cost 140.So the code seems to handle this case.Sample Input 2:2 1 0 10 1 1000 100The code would create an edge from 0-&gt;1 with capacity 1000, cost 100. Reverse edge is 1-&gt;0 with capacity 0, cost -100.The Bellman-Ford computes h[0] =0, h[1] =100.Dijkstra&#39;s first run:adjusted cost for 0-&gt;1 is 100 +0 -100=0. So the path is 0-&gt;1. Delta is 1000. sum_cost is 100. cost becomes 1000 *100=100000. Flow is 1000.So the sample output is correct.Thus, the code should work.Now, the code needs to be written with all the steps. But in Python, the Edge class and the code for handling the residual graph.But in Python, using classes for edges may be a bit slow for large inputs. But given the problem constraints (n up to 250, m up to 5000), and the code using O(F) iterations, but with each iteration being O(m log n), perhaps it&#39;s manageable.But let&#39;s proceed.The code steps:Read n, m, s, t.Build the residual graph.Run Bellman-Ford to compute initial h.Then, while True:   Run Dijkstra to find the shortest path using adjusted costs.   If no path, break.   Extract the path.   Compute delta.   Update flow and cost.   Update residual capacities.   Update potentials.Finally, print flow and cost.Implementing this in Python.Now, handling the edges:The code for the add_edge function.class Edge:    def __init__(self, to, rev, capacity, cost):        self.to = to        self.rev = rev        self.capacity = capacity        self.cost = costdef add_edge(u, v, capacity, cost):    adj[u].append(Edge(v, len(adj[v]), capacity, cost))    adj[v].append(Edge(u, len(adj[u])-1, 0, -cost))Then, after reading the input:n, m, s, t = map(int, input().split())adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]for _ in range(m):    u, v, c, w = map(int, input().split())    add_edge(u, v, c, w)Then, Bellman-Ford:h = [float(&#39;inf&#39;)] * nh[s] = 0for _ in range(n):    updated = False    for u in range(n):        if h[u] == float(&#39;inf&#39;):            continue        for e in adj[u]:            if e.capacity &gt; 0 and h[e.to] &gt; h[u] + e.cost:                h[e.to] = h[u] + e.cost                updated = True    if not updated:        breakThen, the main loop:flow = 0cost = 0while True:    dist = [float(&#39;inf&#39;)] * n    prev = [None] * n    min_cap = [0] * n  # Or initialize to inf?    dist[s] = 0    min_cap[s] = float(&#39;inf&#39;)    heap = []    heapq.heappush(heap, (0, s))    while heap:        d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)        if d &gt; dist[u]:            continue        for e in adj[u]:            if e.capacity &gt; 0:                v = e.to                new_dist = dist[u] + e.cost + h[u] - h[v]                if new_dist &lt; dist[v]:                    dist[v] = new_dist                    prev[v] = e                    min_cap[v] = min(min_cap[u], e.capacity)                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_dist, v))    if dist[t] == float(&#39;inf&#39;):        break    # Update potentials    for i in range(n):        if dist[i] != float(&#39;inf&#39;):            h[i] += dist[i]    # Compute delta    delta = min_cap[t]    # Find the path and sum the costs    v = t    sum_cost = 0    path = []    while v != s:        e = prev[v]        path.append(e)        v = e.rev.to    # Sum the cost of the path edges    sum_cost = sum(e.cost for e in path)    # Update flow and cost    flow += delta    cost += delta * sum_cost    # Update capacities    for e in path:        e.capacity -= delta        rev_e = adj[e.to][e.rev]        rev_e.capacity += deltaprint(flow, cost)Wait, but in the main loop, after running Dijkstra, the code first updates the potentials and then computes delta. But according to the theory, the potentials are updated after the iteration. So the code is correct.Wait, in the code above, after running Dijkstra, the code updates h[i] += dist[i], then computes the path. But in the theory, after the Dijkstra run, the potentials are updated using the dist array. Yes.Yes, because the adjusted costs are computed using the previous h. Then, after the iteration, the new potentials are h_new[v] = h_old[v] + dist[v].So the code is correct.Now, testing the code with the first sample input.Sample Input 1:4 4 0 30 1 4 101 2 2 100 2 4 302 3 4 10After building the adj list:adj[0] contains edges to 1 (cap4, cost10) and to 2 (cap4, cost30).adj[1] contains edges to 0 (cap0, cost-10), to 2 (cap2, cost10).adj[2] contains edges to 0 (cap0, cost-30), to 1 (cap0, cost-10), to 3 (cap4, cost10).adj[3] contains edges to 2 (cap0, cost-10).Bellman-Ford computes h as [0, 10, 20, 30].First iteration:Dijkstra finds path 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;3, delta=2, sum_cost=10+10+10=30. cost += 2*30=60. flow=2.Update capacities: 0-&gt;1&#39;s capacity is 4-2=2. 1-&gt;2&#39;s capacity is 2-2=0. 2-&gt;3&#39;s capacity is4-2=2.Then, update h: dist for 0 is 0, 1 is 0 (0+0), 2 is 0, 3 is 0. h becomes [0, 10, 20, 30] + [0,0,0,0] → no change.Second iteration:Dijkstra runs again. Possible path is 0-&gt;2-&gt;3. Adjusted costs:0-&gt;2:30 +0 -20=10.2-&gt;3:10 +20-30=0. So path cost is 10+0=10.But in the Dijkstra step, the code will find this path. The min_cap along this path is min(4, 2) → 2. So delta=2. sum_cost=30+10=40. cost += 2*40=80. total cost=60+80=140. flow=4.Update capacities: 0-&gt;2&#39;s capacity becomes 4-2=2. 2-&gt;3&#39;s capacity becomes 2-2=0.Now, there&#39;s no more augmenting paths. So the loop breaks. The output is 4 140, which matches the sample.Sample Input 2:2 1 0 10 1 1000 100Bellman-Ford computes h[0]=0, h[1]=100.Dijkstra finds path 0-&gt;1. adjusted cost is 100+0-100=0. delta=1000. sum_cost=100. cost=1000*100=100000. flow=1000.Output is 1000 100000.Thus, the code works.Now, the code needs to be written correctly. One thing to note is that in the code, after updating the potentials, the code proceeds to compute the path. But the path is found using the previous potentials. So the code is correct.Another thing is the handling of min_cap. In the code, min_cap is initialized to 0 for all nodes, except s which is initialized to infinity. But in the Dijkstra step, when processing node u, min_cap[v] is set to min(min_cap[u], e.capacity).Yes. The code initializes min_cap[s] = infinity. For other nodes, min_cap[v] is set as the minimum between the current path&#39;s min_cap (from u) and the edge&#39;s capacity.Thus, when backtracking, the min_cap[t] is the bottleneck capacity of the path.So the code should work.Now, translating this into Python code.The code may have some issues with the Edge class and references. For example, when the edges are stored in the adjacency lists, modifying their capacities may not be possible if they are stored as objects.But in Python, objects are passed by reference, so when we modify e.capacity in the path, it should modify the original edge in the adjacency list.Yes. So the code should work.Thus, the final code is as follows.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine both the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph and the minimum cost required to achieve this maximum flow. This problem can be efficiently addressed using the Successive Shortest Paths algorithm with potential functions to handle costs and ensure non-negative edge weights during each iteration. Approach1. Graph Representation: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each node points to a list of edges. Each edge includes information about its destination, reverse edge, capacity, and cost.2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Initialize the potential values for each node using the Bellman-Ford algorithm to handle any possible negative costs in the residual graph.3. Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm with Potentials: For each iteration, use Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm with a priority queue to find the shortest path in terms of adjusted costs (using potential functions to ensure non-negative weights).4. Flow Augmentation: For each shortest path found, determine the maximum possible flow (minimum residual capacity along the path) and update the residual capacities of the edges.5. Cost Calculation: Track the total cost by summing the costs of the edges along each augmenting path and multiplying by the flow sent through that path.6. Potential Update: After each iteration, update the potential values based on the shortest paths found to ensure non-negative adjusted costs in subsequent iterations.

Graph Construction: The graph is built using an adjacency list where each edge and its reverse edge are stored with their respective capacities and costs.2. Bellman-Ford Initialization: This initializes the potential values to handle any negative costs in the residual graph, ensuring Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm can be used in subsequent iterations.3. Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm: This finds the shortest path in terms of adjusted costs (using potential functions), ensuring non-negative weights and efficient computation.4. Flow Augmentation: For each path found, the maximum possible flow is sent, and residual capacities are updated.5. Cost Calculation: The total cost is accumulated by summing the costs of edges along each path and multiplying by the flow sent.6. Potential Update: After each iteration, potentials are updated to maintain non-negative adjusted costs for subsequent iterations.This approach efficiently computes the maximum flow and the minimum cost required, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.</p><div class="divider" data-v-aa4c0186></div><p class="review-content" data-v-aa4c0186><span class="icon" data-v-aa4c0186>🔑:</span></p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-6d2bec23><span data-v-6d2bec23>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
