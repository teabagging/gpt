So the problem is about grouping numbers based on their common factors and then finding the number of such groups after all possible merges. The input is N, and we have all integers from 2 to N. We need to find how many groups are formed where each group consists of numbers connected through shared factors greater than 1. First, let&#39;s understand the sample inputs. For example, when N is 4, the numbers are 2,3,4. The groups formed are {2,4} (since 2 and 4 share a factor of 2) and {3}. So total 2 groups. For N=8, the groups are {2,3,4,6,8}, {5}, {7}. Wait, how did 3 end up in the same group as 2? Oh right, because 3 and 6 share a factor of 3, and 6 and 2 share a factor of 2. So they are all connected through 6. So the key here is that numbers are grouped if they share a common prime factor, but perhaps via intermediate numbers.Wait, this feels like a union-find problem. Each number can be connected to others if they share a common prime factor. So the groups would be determined by the prime factors they have. But how?Alternatively, perhaps each group is formed by numbers that share a common prime factor, and all primes in the same group are merged if there&#39;s a composite number that includes them. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think again.Let me think about the equivalence relation. Two numbers are in the same group if there&#39;s a chain between them where each adjacent pair shares a common factor &gt;1. So the groups are the connected components of a graph where edges exist between numbers sharing a common divisor &gt;1.But building such a graph for N up to 1e7 is impossible due to memory and time constraints. So we need a smarter approach.Hmm. Let&#39;s think in terms of primes. For example, any two primes p and q will be in separate groups unless there is a composite number that is a multiple of both. For example, primes p and q can&#39;t be connected directly unless their product is &lt;= N. So if there&#39;s a number like p*q in the list (which is between 2 and N), then p and q can be connected via that number. For example, 2 and 3 are connected via 6. So 2 is connected to 6, 3 is connected to 6, so 2 and 3 are in the same group.Wait, but 6 is present when N &gt;=6. So in the case where N is 8, the primes 2 and 3 are connected through 6, and 6 is connected to 2 and 3, 4 via 2, etc. So the group containing 2 will include all numbers that share any prime factor that&#39;s connected through some composite numbers.Wait, maybe the key idea is that the groups are determined by the primes and the way they are connected through their multiples.Alternatively, all numbers in a group must share at least one common prime factor with some other number in the group. But how does the grouping work?Another approach: For each number, the primes that divide it are part of the group. So if two primes are in the same group because there&#39;s a composite number that has both, then all their multiples are part of the same group. So the group is formed by the union of primes that are connected via their multiples.So the problem reduces to: group primes into connected components where two primes are connected if there exists a composite number in [2,N] that is a multiple of both. Then, for each composite number, it belongs to the group of any of its prime factors, which are all in the same component. So the total number of groups would be the number of connected components in this prime graph, plus the number of primes that are not part of any composite number (i.e., primes that are isolated in this graph, which would form their own group since their multiples would be in the same group as them, but if there are no such primes... Wait, no. Let me think again.)Wait, perhaps the number of groups is equal to the number of connected components in the graph formed by the primes, where edges connect primes that co-occur in some composite number&#39;s factors. Because each composite number&#39;s prime factors are connected, and primes that are connected via multiple composite numbers form a single component. So primes in the same component belong to the same group, and each composite number is in the group of any of its primes, which are connected. So each group is formed by all primes in a component and their multiples.Wait, but composite numbers may have multiple primes. For example, 6 has primes 2 and 3. So 2 and 3 are connected. All multiples of 2 and 3 (like 4, 6, 8, 9, etc.) would be part of the same group as 2 and 3, since they are connected via their factors.Wait, but a composite number that&#39;s a multiple of a prime in a connected component is part of that group. So the groups are formed by all numbers (primes and composites) that have at least one prime in a connected component, where the components are based on the primes&#39; co-occurrence in composite numbers.So the problem reduces to:- The groups are the connected components of the primes, where two primes are connected if there&#39;s a composite number in [2,N] that is a multiple of both. Each composite number is in the group of any of its prime factors, which are part of a connected component. So the number of groups is equal to the number of connected components in the prime graph.But wait, what about primes that are not connected to any others? For example, primes larger than N/2. Because a prime p is greater than N/2, then the smallest composite number that includes p and another prime would be 2p. If 2p &gt; N, then such a prime p will not form any composite with another prime. So this prime p would be a separate group. For example, when N=8, the primes 5 and 7. Let&#39;s see: 5 is only in 5*2=10&gt;8. So 5 is a prime in [2,8], and it&#39;s only present as 5. So all multiples of 5 (if any) would be in the same group as 5. But if there are no multiples (like 5*2=10&gt;8), then the group is just {5}. Similarly for 7. So for N=8, the groups are:- The connected component of primes 2 and 3 (since 6 is present, which is 2*3). All multiples of 2 or 3 are part of this group. So 2,3,4,6,8 (4=2*2, 6=2*3, 8=2*4). Then 5 and 7 are isolated primes with no multiples in the list (since 2*5=10&gt;8, 3*5=15&gt;8, etc.), so their groups are each themselves.So the number of groups is the number of connected components in the prime graph plus the number of primes that are in their own component (like 5 and 7 in the example). Wait, no. The connected components in the prime graph are those primes that are connected via a composite. So if a prime is not connected to any others, it&#39;s a component of size 1. So the total number of groups is equal to the number of connected components in this prime graph.But how do we compute this?An alternative approach: the problem is equivalent to finding the number of connected components in a graph where the nodes are primes up to N, and two primes are connected if there exists a composite number ≤ N that is divisible by both. Then, each composite number is grouped into the component of any of its prime factors (since they are all in the same component). So the number of groups is exactly the number of connected components in this graph.So the problem now is to compute the number of connected components in the prime graph as described.So the key steps are:1. Find all primes up to N (using sieve).2. For each prime p, find all primes q &gt; p such that there exists a composite number m ≤ N that is divisible by both p and q. For such pairs (p, q), connect p and q (i.e., they are in the same component).3. The number of connected components after processing all such pairs is the answer.But for large N (up to 1e7), how can we compute this efficiently?Alternatively, the connected components can be determined by the smallest prime in their group. Let&#39;s think about it.For a prime p, the primes that are connected to it are those primes q where p*q ≤ N. Because the composite number p*q is the smallest composite that includes both p and q. If p*q ≤ N, then p and q must be connected. So the primes p and q are connected if p*q ≤ N.Wait, but what if there is a composite m that is a multiple of both p and q, but m is not p*q? For example, m could be p*q*r, but that would still imply that p and q are connected through the composite m. However, even if p*q &gt; N, but there exists a composite m ≤ N that is divisible by both p and q, then p and q are connected. For example, if p=2, q=3, and N=5. Then 2*3=6&gt;5, but there is no composite ≤5 divisible by both 2 and 3, so they are not connected. So in that case, 2 and 3 would not be connected. But if N=6, then 6 is present, so they are connected.So the key is: two primes p and q are connected if and only if there exists a composite number m ≤ N that is divisible by both p and q. The minimal such m is p*q. So if p*q ≤ N, then m = p*q exists, so p and q are connected. If p*q &gt; N, then there is no such composite m, so they are not connected. So the condition for two primes p and q to be connected is p*q ≤ N.So this simplifies the problem: the primes p and q are connected if their product is ≤ N. Then, the connected components of primes can be determined based on this condition.Wait, but what about higher multiples? For example, say p=2, q=3, and N=7. Then 2*3=6 &lt;=7, so they are connected. Even if there are larger composites like 6*2=12 (but 12&gt;7), but 6 is present. So in this case, 2 and 3 are connected. Another example: N=15. Suppose primes 3 and 5. 3*5=15 &lt;=15, so they are connected. So 3 and 5 are in the same component.Thus, the connectedness between primes p and q is determined by whether p*q &lt;= N. If yes, then they are connected. Otherwise, not.So the problem reduces to grouping primes into connected components where any two primes are connected if their product is &lt;= N.But this seems similar to forming connected components where primes are connected if they are part of a pair with product &lt;= N. Then, the connected components can be found by merging all primes that can be linked through such pairs.So how can we model this? Let&#39;s think of each prime as a node. For primes p and q (p &lt; q), if p*q &lt;= N, then p and q are connected, so we merge their components.But this is not the complete picture. Because even if p and q are connected, and q and r are connected (because q*r &lt;= N), then p and r are connected via q. So this is a union-find problem where we need to merge primes into sets where any two primes in the set can be connected through a chain of primes, each adjacent pair in the chain having product &lt;= N.So the approach is:1. Generate all primes up to N.2. For each prime p, find all primes q &gt; p such that p * q &lt;= N. For each such q, union(p, q).3. The number of connected components in the union-find structure is the answer.But for N up to 1e7, the number of primes can be up to around 664579 (since the number of primes below 1e7 is 664,579). But even with that, checking all pairs of primes for each p is O(π(N)^2), which is way too slow for N=1e7. So this approach is not feasible.We need a smarter way to compute the number of connected components without enumerating all pairs.Let me think differently. Let&#39;s sort the primes in increasing order. Then, for a prime p, all primes q where q &lt;= N/p are candidates to be merged with p. Because p*q &lt;= N implies q &lt;= N/p. So for each p, the maximum q that can be connected to p via their product is floor(N/p). So the primes q in [p+1, floor(N/p)] can be merged with p.But again, checking all such q for each p is O(π(N)^2), which is not feasible.Alternative idea: The connected components are formed by consecutive ranges of primes. For example, all primes up to some maximum p_max form a component. Because for primes p and q in such a range, their product is small enough. Wait, but this depends on their product. Let&#39;s think about the minimal primes. For example, the smallest primes will have the largest possible q (since N/p is largest when p is smallest). So maybe the largest primes are isolated, and the smaller primes form a single component.Wait, let&#39;s consider the example where N=8. Primes are 2,3,5,7. For 2, q can be up to 8/2=4. The primes &lt;=4 and &gt;2 are 3. So 2 is connected to 3. For 3, q can be up to 8/3≈2.666, so no primes. So 3&#39;s only connection is to 2. For 5, q must be &lt;=8/5=1.6, which is none. Similarly for 7. So connected components are {2,3}, {5}, {7} → 3 groups, which matches the sample.Another example: N=15. Primes are 2,3,5,7,11,13. For 2, q can be up to 7 (since 2*7=14 &lt;=15). So 2 connects to 3,5,7. For 3, q can be up to 5 (15/3=5). So 3 connects to 5. So the connected primes are 2,3,5,7. Then 11 and 13: 11*2=22&gt;15, so they are isolated. So groups are {2,3,5,7}, {11}, {13} → 3 groups.So the connected component for the smaller primes is formed by merging all primes up to some maximum where their product is &lt;= N. Let&#39;s see.But how can we find the connected components efficiently?Another idea: The union operations can be optimized by considering that the primes are ordered. For each prime p, the primes that can be connected to p are those primes q where q &lt;= N/p. Since the primes are sorted, for each p, the primes q in the range (p, N/p] are to be merged with p.But merging all primes q in this range with p would connect all of them into the same component. However, this might not be the case. For example, if p and q are merged, and q and r are merged, then all three are in the same component. So perhaps the union operations can be optimized by noting that primes in a certain interval can be merged with p, and then their intervals can be processed as well.Alternatively, perhaps all primes in the range [2, s], where s is the maximal prime such that the product of the first two primes in the component is &lt;= N. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that the smallest prime is 2. Then the maximum q that can be connected to 2 is floor(N/2). All primes up to floor(N/2) will be merged with 2, because 2* q &lt;= N. Then, for each of these primes, say q, their maximum allowed primes are floor(N/q). So for example, if 3 is in the component of 2, then primes up to floor(N/3) can be merged with 3, which may be larger than floor(N/2). Wait, no. For example, if N=15, floor(N/2)=7. So primes up to 7 can be merged with 2. When we process 3, floor(N/3)=5. So primes up to 5 can be merged with 3, but they are already in the same component as 2. Then 5: floor(N/5)=3, which is less than 5. So 5 can merge with 2 and 3. But all primes up to 7 (since 2*7=14 &lt;=15) are merged into the same component. Wait, but 7 is part of the component because 2*7=14 &lt;=15, so 7 is merged into 2&#39;s component. Then, when considering 7, floor(N/7)=2. So 7 can merge with 2, which is already done.So the component for 2 includes all primes up to floor(N/2), but also any primes that can be connected via other primes. But perhaps the maximum prime in the component is floor(N/2). Because once you merge all primes up to floor(N/2), any larger primes would have product with 2 larger than N. So they are not merged. But for other primes within the component, their product with larger primes may be &lt;=N.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s take N=30. Then, primes up to 15 (floor(30/2)=15) are merged with 2. The primes in 2&#39;s component are 3,5,7,11,13. Now, for prime 3, floor(30/3) =10. So primes up to 10 (primes 5,7) would be merged with 3, but they are already merged with 2. For prime 5, floor(30/5)=6. Primes up to 6 are 5 and 3, but 3 is already in the component. So the component of 2 includes all primes up to 15. But wait, 11*3=33&gt;30. So why is 11 part of the component? Because 11 is merged with 2 via 2*11=22 &lt;=30. So 11 is part of the component.So the component for 2 includes all primes up to floor(N/2), regardless of their product with other primes. Because once they are merged with 2, they are in the same component. So even if their product with another prime in the component exceeds N, they are still connected via the chain through 2.So perhaps the component of the smallest prime (2) includes all primes up to floor(N/2). Then, any prime larger than floor(N/2) can only be merged with primes if there exists a prime q such that q * p &lt;=N. But since p is larger than floor(N/2), q must be &lt;= N/p, which is less than 2. So q can only be 2, but 2*p would be larger than N. So such primes (p &gt; N/2) cannot be merged with any other primes, so they are each in their own component.Thus, the number of groups is equal to 1 (for the component containing 2 and all primes up to floor(N/2)) plus the number of primes greater than floor(N/2). Because those primes can&#39;t form a composite with any other prime (since 2*p &gt; N and p is a prime).Wait, let&#39;s test this. For N=4, floor(N/2)=2. Primes up to 2 are [2,3] (wait, no. Wait N=4, floor(4/2)=2. Primes up to 2 are 2 and 3? No, wait 3 is 3, which is greater than 2. So floor(N/2) for N=4 is 2. So primes up to 2 is only 2. Then, primes &gt;2 are 3. So according to this logic, the component of 2 is 2, and primes &gt;2 (3) are in their own groups. So total groups would be 1 (for 2) plus 1 (for 3) → 2. Which matches the sample.Another example: N=8. floor(8/2)=4. Primes up to 4 are 2,3. Then primes larger than 4 are 5,7. So the component of 2 and 3 is merged (since 2*3=6&lt;=8). Then, 5 and 7 are their own groups. So total groups 1+2=3, which matches the sample.Another example: N=7. floor(7/2)=3. Primes up to 3 are 2,3. Primes larger than 3 are 5,7. So groups would be 1 (2 and 3) plus 2 (5,7) → 3 groups.Another test case: N=6. floor(6/2)=3. Primes up to 3: 2,3. primes larger than 3:5. So groups are 1 + 1 =2. Let&#39;s see: the numbers are 2,3,4,5,6. The groups would be {2,3,4,6}, {5} → 2 groups. Correct.So this seems to work. Thus, the number of groups is:number of primes &gt; floor(N/2) + 1 (if there are primes &lt;= floor(N/2)) else 0.Wait, but what if there are no primes &lt;= floor(N/2)? For example, N=2. Then floor(2/2)=1. primes up to 1: none. So the component of 2 would be 2 itself, but according to the logic, the primes &gt;1 are 2. So the number of groups would be 1 (for primes &gt;1, which is 2) → which matches the sample.Another example: N=3. floor(3/2) =1. primes up to 1: none. primes &gt;1: 2,3. So according to the logic, the groups are 2 and 3, which are each their own groups. Because 2 and 3: 2*3=6&gt;3, so they are not connected. So the answer is 2. Let&#39;s see: numbers are 2,3. They don&#39;t share a factor, so two groups. Correct.So the general formula is:The number of primes in (N//2, N] plus the count of groups formed by primes &lt;= N//2.Wait, but according to earlier examples, primes &lt;= N//2 are all in one group. So if there&#39;s at least one prime &lt;= N//2, then the number of groups is 1 (from the component of primes &lt;= N//2) plus the number of primes &gt; N//2. Otherwise, if there are no primes &lt;= N//2 (like N=2), then the number of groups is equal to the number of primes in (N//2, N], which is the primes in (1,2], which is 2.Wait, but N=2: primes in (1,2] is 2. So groups is 1. Which is correct.So the formula is:If primes exist in [2, N//2], then the total groups are (number of primes in (N//2, N]) + 1.Else (i.e., no primes &lt;= N//2, which can only happen when N//2 &lt; 2, so N &lt;4), then the number of groups is equal to the number of primes in (N//2, N]. For example, N=2: primes in (1,2] → 2 → 1 group. N=3: primes in (1,3] → 2,3 → but N//2=1. So primes in (1,3] are 2 and 3. Are they connected? For N=3, 2 and 3 have product 6&gt;3. So they are separate groups. So the answer is 2.So the formula would be:groups = count_of_primes_gt_half + (1 if exists_primes_leq_half else 0)But how do we compute this?count_of_primes_gt_half is the number of primes in (N//2, N].exists_primes_leq_half is whether there exists any primes &lt;= N//2.But if exists_primes_leq_half is true, then the groups formed by primes &lt;= N//2 is merged into one group, and each prime in the higher range forms its own group.So the steps are:1. Compute all primes up to N.2. Compute the count of primes in (N//2, N] → call this C.3. Check if there are any primes &lt;= N//2 → if yes, then the answer is C + 1. Else, the answer is C.So for N=8, N//2=4. Primes in (4,8] →5,7 → C=2. Any primes &lt;=4 → yes (2,3). So answer is 2+1=3.For N=4, N//2=2. Primes in (2,4] →3 → C=1. Any primes &lt;=2 → yes (2). So answer 1+1=2.For N=3, N//2=1. Primes in (1,3] →2,3 → C=2. Are there primes &lt;=1 → no. So answer is 2.Wait, but according to the formula, when N=3, the answer would be C (2) + 0 →2. Which is correct.So the formula is:answer = C + (1 if (there exists at least one prime &lt;= N//2) else 0)Thus, the problem reduces to computing two values for each N: the count of primes in (N//2, N], and whether there are any primes &lt;= N//2.So now, how do we compute these efficiently for multiple test cases up to T=2e5 and N up to 1e7?The solution is to precompute a sieve of primes up to 1e7, and precompute for each N the value of C and the existence of primes &lt;= N//2.But for each test case N, we can precompute:- The number of primes in (N//2, N] → which is equal to π(N) - π(N//2)- Check if π(N//2) &gt;= 1 → i.e., whether there is at least one prime &lt;= N//2.So the answer is:if there are primes &lt;= N//2 → (π(N) - π(N//2)) + 1else → (π(N) - π(N//2)) But wait, if N is 2, then N//2 is 1. So π(1) is 0. π(N) is 1. So (1-0) =1, and since there are no primes &lt;=1, the answer is 1. Correct.Another example: N=3. N//2=1. π(3) is 2, π(1)=0. So C=2. Are there primes &lt;=1? No. So answer is 2.N=4. N//2=2. π(4)=2, π(2)=1. So C=2-1=1. Are there primes &lt;=2 → yes. So answer 1+1=2.Thus, the formula is correct.So the steps to compute the answer for each N are:Compute the count of primes in (N//2, N] as (π(N) - π(N//2)), then add 1 if there exists at least one prime in [2, N//2], which is equivalent to π(N//2) ≥ 1.So the answer is:ans = (π(N) - π(N//2)) + (1 if π(N//2) ≥1 else 0)But wait, when N//2 is less than 2, then π(N//2) is 0, so the 1 is not added. Otherwise, if π(N//2) ≥1, then add 1.Thus, the formula can be written as:ans = (π(N) - π(N//2)) + (π(N//2) &gt; 0 ? 1 : 0)But how about when N//2 is 0? For N=1, but according to constraints, N starts from 2. So N//2 is at least 1 (for N=2, 2//2=1). So π(1) is 0. So for N=2, N//2=1. π(1) is 0. So ans = (π(2) - π(1)) + 0 → 1-0=1. Correct.Thus, the approach is:Precompute π(x) for all x up to 1e7. Then for each test case N:ans = (π(N) - π(N//2)) + (1 if π(N//2) &gt;=1 else 0)But how do we compute π(x) efficiently?The sieve of Eratosthenes can compute the number of primes up to x, and for that, we can precompute a prefix array of primes counts.So the plan is:1. Precompute sieve up to 1e7.2. Precompute an array prime_count where prime_count[x] is the number of primes ≤x.3. For each test case N:   a. Compute half = N // 2.   b. c = prime_count[N] - prime_count[half]   d. if prime_count[half] &gt;=1 → answer is c + 1   else → answer is cBut how to precompute prime_count?Yes, this is feasible. The sieve will take O(n log log n) time, which for n=1e7 is manageable. The sieve can be an array of booleans, and then the prime_count array can be built by prefix sum.So, for example, sieve[i] is True if i is prime. Then, prime_count[i] = prime_count[i-1] + (1 if sieve[i] else 0).Once we have the sieve and prime_count, each test case can be answered in O(1) time.Now, let&#39;s test the sample inputs.Sample Input 1:32 → N=2.half = 1.prime_count[2] =1, prime_count[1] =0.c =1-0=1.prime_count[half] =0 → add 0.ans =1 → correct.Sample Input 4:N=4.half=2.prime_count[4]=2 (primes 2,3).prime_count[2] =1 (2).c=2-1=1.prime_count[2] &gt;=1 → yes. ans=1+1=2 → correct.Sample Input 8:N=8.half=4.prime_count[8]=4 (2,3,5,7).prime_count[4] is 2 (2,3).c=4-2=2.prime_count[4] &gt;=1 → yes. ans=2+1=3 → correct.Thus, the formula works.Now, let&#39;s think about another example where N=6.primes up to 6: 2,3,5.half=3. primes up to 3:2,3 → count 2.c=3 (primes 5, but wait 5 is &lt;=6. Wait N=6: primes are 2,3,5.prime_count[6] =3.prime_count[3] =2 (2 and3).c=3-2=1 → primes in (3,6] are 5.Then, since prime_count[3] &gt;=1 → yes. ans=1+1=2. Which is correct, because the groups are {2,3,4,6}, {5}.Another example: N=5.half=2. primes up to 5: 2,3,5.prime_count[5] =3.prime_count[2] =1.c=3-1=2 (primes 3,5).But 3 is in (2,5], and 5 is in (2,5]. But 3 and5: 3*5=15&gt;5. So they are separate groups. So the answer would be 2 (primes 3 and5) plus 1 (the component of 2) → 3.Wait, according to the formula, ans is c + 1 → 2 +1=3. Which is correct.So the formula works.Thus, the approach is correct.Now, the code can be written as follows:Precompute sieve and prime_count.For each test case, compute half = N//2, then ans = (prime_count[N] - prime_count[half]) + (1 if prime_count[half] &gt;0 else 0).But wait, when N//2 is 1, prime_count[1] is 0. So if N=2, the code adds 0. Which is correct.So in code:In Python, precompute sieve and prefix counts.But for N up to 1e7, the sieve may be memory intensive. However, in Python, using a sieve of Eratosthenes for 1e7 is possible, but might require using a bitwise sieve or a list of booleans.But 1e7 is manageable. Let&#39;s see: a list of booleans for sieve would take about 1e7 bytes, which is about 10MB. So manageable.So code steps:1. Precompute sieve up to 1e7.2. Precompute prime_count as a list where prime_count[x] is the number of primes up to x.3. For each test case:   a. Read N.   b. half = N//2.   c. c = prime_count[N] - prime_count[half].   d. if prime_count[half] &gt;=1: ans = c +1.   else: ans = c.   e. print(ans)Thus, this code should handle all test cases efficiently.Now, let&#39;s test the code with the sample inputs.Sample Input 1:32 → ans=14 → ans=28 → ans=3.Which matches the sample.Another test case: N=5.half=2. prime_count[5]=3 (2,3,5). prime_count[2]=1.c=3-1=2 (primes 3 and5). since prime_count[half] is 1, ans=2+1=3. Which is correct.Thus, the code should work.Now, the only challenge is to precompute the sieve and prime_count for N up to 1e7 efficiently in Python, given that T can be up to 2e5.Implementing sieve of Eratosthenes for 1e7:But in Python, sieve for 1e7 can be done as follows:sieve = [True] * (max_n + 1)sieve[0] = sieve[1] = Falsefor i in range(2, int(max_n0.5) +1):   if sieve[i]:      sieve[i*i : max_n+1 : i] = [False]*len(sieve[i*i : max_n+1 : i])Then, compute prime_count as a prefix sum.prime_count = [0]*(max_n+1)count =0for i in range(max_n+1):   if sieve[i]:      count +=1   prime_count[i] = countBut for 1e7, this may take some time, but manageable.But since T is up to 2e5 and each test case requires O(1) time, the pre-processing is acceptable.Thus, the code can be written as follows:Read T test cases, precompute sieve up to the maximum N across all test cases. But since N can be up to 1e7, precompute sieve up to 1e7.But for multiple test cases, this is required.So code outline:Read all test cases, find the maximum N, then sieve up to that N.But if T is up to 2e5 and each N can be up to 1e7, but reading all test cases first may require a lot of memory. So alternative approach: sieve up to 1e7 once, regardless of test cases.Because in the problem statement, the constraints are T up to 2e5, and N up to 1e7. So sieve up to 1e7.Thus, the code can be written as:import sysdef main():    import sys    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    T = int(input[0])    cases = list(map(int, input[1:T+1]))    max_n = max(cases)    sieve = [True]*(max_n +1)    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False    for i in range(2, int(max_n0.5)+1):        if sieve[i]:            sieve[i*i : max_n+1 :i] = [False]*( (max_n -i*i) //i +1 )    # compute prefix sum    prime_count = [0]*(max_n+1)    count =0    for i in range(max_n+1):        if sieve[i]:            count +=1        prime_count[i] = count    for N in cases:        half = N //2        c = prime_count[N] - prime_count[half]        if prime_count[half] &gt;=1:            print(c +1)        else:            print(c)But for N=1e7, sieve array of size 1e7+1 is about 40MB (since each element is a boolean, which in Python is stored as a byte). Wait, in Python, a list of booleans takes more memory. For example, a list of 1e7 booleans would take around 40MB (each element uses 4 bytes in a list, but I&#39;m not sure). Alternatively, using a bit array can reduce memory. But for the purposes of this problem, assuming that sieve can be handled in memory.But when N is up to 1e7, the sieve array will have 1e7+1 elements. For Python, this is manageable.But in practice, when you run this code for N=1e7, sieve of size 1e7+1 may take around 40MB, which is acceptable.But for T=2e5, and each test case requiring O(1) time, the code should run within time limits.Testing this code with the sample inputs:Sample Input:3248Sample Output:123Which matches.Thus, the code is correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed by integers from 2 to N, where each group consists of integers that share a common factor greater than 1. The solution involves efficiently determining these groups using prime factorization and sieve methods. Approach1. Prime Sieve Method: We use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute prime numbers up to the maximum value of N encountered in the input. This helps in efficiently determining prime numbers and their counts.2. Prefix Sum Array: We maintain a prefix sum array to count the number of primes up to any given number. This allows us to quickly compute the number of primes in any range.3. Group Calculation: For each test case, we determine the number of primes in the range (N//2, N] and check if there are any primes less than or equal to N//2. The number of groups is then calculated based on these counts.

Prime Sieve: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is used to mark non-prime numbers up to the maximum value of N. This helps in efficiently determining which numbers are primes.2. Prefix Sum Array: This array keeps track of the cumulative count of primes up to each index. This allows quick lookup of the number of primes up to any number.3. Group Calculation:   - For each test case, compute the midpoint `half = N // 2`.   - Calculate the number of primes in the range `(half, N]` using the prefix sum array.   - If there are primes up to `half`, add 1 to the count of primes in the higher range to account for the group formed by primes up to `half`.   - If there are no primes up to `half`, the count of primes in the higher range directly gives the number of groups.This approach efficiently handles the constraints and provides results in constant time per test case after preprocessing, making it suitable for large inputs.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-cebbdad3 data-v-2e624778><div class="review" data-v-2e624778><div class="review-title" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>❓:</span>Samwell is bored while going to his medical school in Oldtown. He has a deck of cards that John had gifted him. He starts to play the following game.The rules for his game is simple.He deals cards one by one in a row from left to right. He does not overlap his cards. Whenever the card matches its immediate neighbour on the left, or matches the third card to the left, he may move it onto that card. He can match the cards if they are of the same suit or same number.After making a move, Samwell looks to see if it has made additional moves possible. He can move only the top card of each pile at any given time. He must close up the gaps between piles as soon as they appear by moving all piles on the right of the gap one position to the left. He has to deal out the whole pack, combining cards towards the left whenever possible. He wins the game if the pack is reduced to a single pile. Sometimes Samwell has more than one play that is possible. Where two cards may be moved, He adopts the strategy of always moving the leftmost card possible.Input:Input data to the program specifies the order in which cards are dealt from the pack.The input contains pairs of lines, each line containing 26 cards separated by single space characters. The final line of the input file contains a # as its first character. Cards are represented as a two character code. The first character is the face-value (A=Ace, 2-9, T=10, J=Jack, Q=Queen, K=King) and the second character is the suit (C=Clubs, D=Diamonds, H=Hearts, S=Spades).There will be at most 10 test cases.Output:One line of output must be produced for each pair of lines (that between them describe a pack of 52 cards) in the input.First Number denotes number of piles and rest of output shows the number of cards in each of the pile remaining after playing the game with the pack of cards as described by the corresponding pairs of input lines.Note: Samwell suggests you to play this game.SAMPLE INPUTQD AD 8H 5S 3H 5H TC 4D JH KS 6H 8S JS AC AS 8D 2H QS TS 3S AH 4H TH TD 3C 6S8C 7D 4C 4S 7S 9H 7C 5D 2S KD 2D QH JD 6D 9D JC 2C KH 3D QC 6C 9S KC 7H 9C 5CAC 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KC AD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D TD 9D JD QD KDAH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H KH 6S QH TH AS 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS#SAMPLE OUTPUT6 40 8 1 1 1 11 52ExplanationSimulation of 2nd test case:Firstly, he moves 2C to AC, then 3C to 2C and so on till:Pile1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC Other Piles: AD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D TD 9D JD QD KDAH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H KH 6S QH TH AS 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KSHe does the same thing with the diamondsPile1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC Pile 2: AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KDCards to be dealt: AH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H KH 6S QH TH AS 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KSNow he moves Pile of KD to KCPile 1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC,AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KDCards to be dealt: AH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H KH 6S QH TH AS 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KSNext Move, Pile up all the Hearts and put it to KD pilePile 1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC,AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KD,AH,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,7H,8H,9H,KH Cards to be dealt: 6S QH TH AS 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KSNext he moves TH to KH pilePile 1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC,AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KD,AH,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,7H,8H,9H,KH,TH Other Piles: 6S QH ASCards to be dealt: 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS Next he moves 2S to 6S (Note that he didn&#39;t move it to AS), 3S to 2S and so on:Pile 1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC,AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KD,AH,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,7H,8H,9H,KH,TH Pile 2: 6S,2S,3S,4S,5S,QH  Pile 3: AS  Cards to be dealt: JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS Next Move JH to TH and QH pile to JHPile 1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC,AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KD,AH,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,7H,8H,9H,KH,TH,JH,6S,2S,3S,4S,5S,QH Pile 2: AS Cards to be dealt: 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS Next he groups all Spades till QSPile 1: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC,AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KD,AH,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,7H,8H,9H,KH,TH,JH,6S,2S,3S,4S,5S,QH Pile 2: AS,7S,8S,9S,TS,JS,QS Cards to be dealt: KSAfter this he will move pile of QS to QH and KS to QSFinal Pile: AC,2C,3C,4C,5C,6C,7C,8C,9C,TC,JC,QC,KC,AD,2D,3D,4D,5D,6D,7D,8D,TD,9D,JD,QD,KD,AH,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,7H,8H,9H,KH,TH,JH,6S,2S,3S,4S,5S,QH,AS,7S,8S,9S,TS,JS,QS,KS</div><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>🧠:</span>Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem. Hmm, so the task is to simulate the card game as described and output the number of piles and their sizes after processing each test case. First, I need to understand the rules thoroughly. The game starts by dealing cards one by one into a row. Whenever a card matches (same suit or number) its immediate left neighbor or the third to the left, it can be moved onto that pile. And after moving, we check again for possible moves. Also, when there are multiple possible moves, the leftmost possible card is moved first. And after each move, any gaps are closed by shifting the right piles left.So, the main steps are: process each card by dealing it into the row, then check for possible moves (left neighbor or third to the left) in left to right order. Each move might trigger more moves, so we need to loop until no more moves are possible. After all cards are dealt, output the result.Hmm. So the key is to model the piles and their positions correctly. Each pile can be considered as a stack (since only the top card is considered for moves). The initial setup is that each new card starts as a new pile at the end. Then, after each addition, we need to check for possible moves starting from the leftmost possible pile.Wait, but the movement is allowed for the top card of each pile. So for each pile, the top card can be moved to the left neighbor (if possible) or the third left neighbor (if possible). But the movement is done in a way that the leftmost possible move is taken first.So the algorithm would be something like:- Initialize a list of piles. Each pile is a list of cards, with the last card being the top.- For each card in the input:   - Add it as a new pile to the end of the list.   - Then, check from the beginning of the list for any possible moves (left neighbor or third left). If any move is possible, perform it, then check again from the start, because moving can create new opportunities.Wait, but after adding a new card, the possible moves could be with the new pile (i.e., the new card can be moved to the left neighbor or third left). But after moving, the positions of the piles may shift, so the indices need to be adjusted.Wait, for example, after adding a new pile at position i, check if i can be moved to i-1 (if possible) or i-3 (if possible). But when moving, the pile is merged into the target, and the current pile is removed. Then, the piles after the current position are shifted left. So after any move, the list of piles changes, and we need to re-check from the beginning because previous moves may have created new possible moves.But how to efficiently check for possible moves? Because after each move, the entire list could have changed. So the approach is: after adding a new card, enter a loop where we scan the entire list from left to right. For each pile, check if it can be moved to the left neighbor (if exists) or third left (if exists). For each pile, check both possibilities. The first possible move (leftmost possible) is executed, and then the loop restarts from the beginning because moving could have created new opportunities.Wait, but the movement of a pile might affect the indices. So for example, suppose there are piles at positions 0,1,2,3,4. If pile 4 is moved to pile 3&#39;s third left (which would be 4-3=1?), wait no. Third left from position i would be i-3. But wait, the third left is three positions to the left. So for example, for a pile at index 3, the third left is index 0. But if the pile is at index 2, the third left would be index -1, which is invalid.So for any pile at position i, the possible targets are:- left neighbor: i-1 (if i-1 &gt;=0)- third left: i-3 (if i-3 &gt;=0)For each of these possible targets, check if the top card of the current pile matches (same suit or number) the top card of the target pile. If any of these are possible, choose the leftmost possible option. Wait, but according to the problem statement, &quot;He adopts the strategy of always moving the leftmost card possible.&quot; So, when there are multiple possible moves (for example, a pile can move to left neighbor or third left), which one is chosen?Wait, the problem says: &quot;Where two cards may be moved, He adopts the strategy of always moving the leftmost card possible.&quot; So, if a card can be moved to the left neighbor or to the third left, which one is chosen? For example, if the current pile is at position i, and both i-1 and i-3 are valid, which one is moved first.Wait, perhaps the leftmost possible refers to the earliest pile that can be moved. So during the scan, when checking from left to right, for each pile, check if it can move to left neighbor (i-1) first. If that&#39;s possible, perform the move. Otherwise, check if it can move to i-3. As soon as a move is found, perform it, and restart the scanning from the beginning.So the process is:After adding a new card, enter a loop where:For each i from 0 to len(piles)-1:   Check if i-1 &gt;=0 and current pile&#39;s top matches left neighbor&#39;s top. If yes, move it to i-1, remove the current pile (i), and break the loop to restart checking from 0.   Else, check if i-3 &gt;=0 and current pile&#39;s top matches third left&#39;s top. If yes, move it to i-3, remove the current pile (i), and break to restart.So the first possible move (leftmost pile that can be moved) is processed. Then, after moving, the list of piles is updated, and the process starts over from the beginning.Wait, but the &#39;leftmost possible card&#39; refers to the earliest possible pile that can be moved. So the scanning is done left to right. The first pile (leftmost) that can make a move (either to left neighbor or third left) is processed. Once a move is made, the list changes, and the process restarts from the beginning.So the algorithm after adding a card is:while True:   moved = False   for i in range(len(piles)):      if i &gt;=1:          check if piles[i] top matches piles[i-1] top.          if yes, then move the top of piles[i] to piles[i-1], and remove piles[i]. Then, set moved = True. Break the loop and restart.          else, check if i &gt;=3 and matches i-3. If yes, move and set moved.      else:          check i &gt;=3.      if moved, break and restart.   if no moves after scanning all piles, break.Wait, no. Because once a move is made during the scan, we need to break the current scan and start over. Because after moving, the indices have changed. So, for example, if during the scan at i=2, a move is made, then the entire list changes, and the scan must restart from the beginning.So the code would be:after dealing a new card, start a loop:   while True:       moved = False       for i in range(len(piles)):           if i &gt;= 1:               if can_move(piles[i-1], piles[i]):                   # move piles[i] to i-1                   merge piles[i] into piles[i-1]                   del piles[i]                   moved = True                   break  # exit the for loop to restart the scan           if i &gt;=3:               if can_move(piles[i-3], piles[i]):                   # move piles[i] to i-3                   merge piles[i] into piles[i-3]                   del piles[i]                   moved = True                   break       if not moved:           breakSo in this approach, each time a move is made, the loop breaks and starts again from i=0.But the order here is important. For a given pile i, first check the left neighbor (i-1) and if possible, move. If not, check the third left (i-3). But when moving, once a move is made, the entire list is changed, so we have to restart the scan from the beginning.This approach ensures that the leftmost possible pile that can be moved is processed first. Because during each scan, we process the first possible i in the for loop where a move is possible.For example, if during the scan, i=0 can&#39;t move, i=1 can&#39;t, i=2 can move to i-1 (1). Then we move, delete i=2, which shifts the rest of the piles. Then, restart the scan from i=0 again.This seems correct.Now, the function can_move is to check if the top card of the current pile (source) matches the top card of the target pile (destination) in suit or number.So for two cards, their suit or rank must be the same.So, for a card, the first character is the rank (A, 2-9, T, J, Q, K), the second is the suit.So, comparing two cards: if their first characters are same (same rank), or second characters same (same suit), then they can be merged.So, the can_move function would take two cards (the top of the source and target piles) and return True if they match.Wait, but the piles can have multiple cards, but we only look at the top card (the last one in the pile&#39;s list). So for each pile, we need to track the top card.So each pile can be represented as a list of cards, and the top is the last element.So when a pile is merged into another, the source pile&#39;s cards are added to the destination pile. But wait, no: the source pile is moved onto the destination pile. So the destination pile&#39;s top is now the source&#39;s top.Wait, the problem says &quot;he may move it onto that card.&quot; So when moving, the source pile (current) is moved onto the target pile. So the target pile&#39;s top becomes the source&#39;s top.Wait, but the source is a single card? No, the source is a pile. Wait, no. Each pile is a stack of cards. When he moves a pile&#39;s top card, does he take just that card and add it to the target pile? Or does he move the entire source pile onto the target?Wait, the problem says &quot;Whenever the card matches its immediate neighbour on the left, or matches the third card to the left, he may move it onto that card. He can match the cards if they are of the same suit or same number.&quot;So, when he moves a card, he moves the top card of the current pile onto the target pile. So the current pile (source) loses that top card. But wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;he may move it onto that card.&quot; So the entire pile is moved? Or just the top card?Wait, the problem says &quot;he may move it onto that card.&quot; The &quot;it&quot; refers to the card. So, when a card (the top of the pile) can be moved, the entire pile is merged into the target pile. Wait, no. Let&#39;s re-read the problem statement.The problem says:&quot;Whenever the card matches its immediate neighbour on the left, or matches the third card to the left, he may move it onto that card. He can match the cards if they are of the same suit or same number.&quot;So, the &#39;it&#39; is the card (the top card of the current pile). So he can move that card onto the matching card (the top of the left neighbor or third left). So when moving, the current pile&#39;s top card is removed and placed on the target pile. But then, the current pile would have one less card. Wait, but the problem says &quot;He must close up the gaps between piles as soon as they appear by moving all piles on the right of the gap one position to the left.&quot; So, when a pile has zero cards (after moving its top card?), the gap is closed. But that&#39;s not possible if the pile has only one card. So perhaps when the top card is moved, the entire pile is moved (i.e., the entire pile is merged into the target pile). Alternatively, perhaps each pile is a stack of cards. When the top card can be moved, the entire pile is moved (appended) to the target pile. Because otherwise, moving a single card would leave the rest of the pile in the same position, which complicates things. But the problem says &quot;the top card of each pile at any given time.&quot; So the top card is the only one considered for moves. So perhaps when moving, only the top card is moved. But then, after moving, the pile would have no cards left, so the pile is removed. But that&#39;s not possible because the pile was just created by dealing. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.Wait, the problem says: &quot;He can move only the top card of each pile at any given time. He must close up the gaps between piles as soon as they appear by moving all piles on the right of the gap one position to the left.&quot;So, when a pile&#39;s top card is moved, the pile is removed (since the card was the only one, or the pile is now empty?), and the gap is closed by shifting.Wait, perhaps each pile is a single card. But that&#39;s not possible because when a card is moved onto another, the target pile would then have two cards. For example, the first two piles: if the second card matches the first, then it is moved onto the first pile. So the first pile now has two cards, and the second pile is removed.So, the piles can have multiple cards. The top card is the last one added. So when moving, the entire pile is moved? Or just the top card?Wait, the problem says: &quot;he may move it onto that card.&quot; So the &#39;it&#39; refers to the card (the top card of the pile). So he moves that single card. So when you move the top card of a pile to another pile, the source pile loses that card. If the source pile becomes empty, then it&#39;s removed, and the piles to the right are shifted left.But this raises the question: How can a pile have more than one card? Because each new card is dealt as a new pile. The only way a pile can have multiple cards is when other cards are moved onto it. For example, if pile A has a card, and another card is moved onto it, then pile A has two cards. The top card is the latest one added.Wait, maybe the way to model the piles is as a list of lists. Each pile is a list of cards. The top of the pile is the last element of the list.When a card is moved from pile i to pile j, the top card (last element) of pile i is popped and appended to pile j. Then, if pile i is now empty, it is removed from the list of piles, and the piles after it are shifted left.But how does this affect the indices during the scanning process?Alternatively, perhaps when a pile is merged into another, the entire pile is moved. For example, if pile i can be moved to pile j, then pile j&#39;s list is extended with pile i&#39;s list, and pile i is removed. But this would allow for multiple cards to be moved, but according to the problem statement, only the top card is considered. So this approach is not correct.Hmm, perhaps the problem statement is ambiguous here. Let&#39;s look at the sample input and output.In the sample explanation for the second test case:They mention moving 2C to AC, then 3C to 2C, etc. So each time a new card is added, it&#39;s moved onto the previous pile. So each move appends the card to the left pile. So the piles can accumulate multiple cards. For example, the first pile becomes AC, 2C, 3C, etc., each new card being added to the top of the pile.Wait, but when a new card is added to a pile, it&#39;s the top card. So when a card is moved onto another pile, the target pile&#39;s top becomes that card. So the order matters.Wait, perhaps each pile is a stack. When you move a card (the top of the source pile) onto the target pile, the source pile&#39;s top is removed and added to the target pile&#39;s top. So, the target pile&#39;s top becomes the moved card.So, the process is: when a card from pile i is moved to pile j, the source pile i is reduced by one card (the top one), and the target pile j gains that card as its new top. If the source pile i becomes empty after this, it&#39;s removed from the list of piles, and the gaps are closed.But how does this affect the simulation?For example, if we have piles [ [A], [B], [C] ], and B is moved onto A. Then, the piles become [ [A, B], [C] ]. Now, the top of the first pile is B. Then, if C can be moved to B, then it would be moved, resulting in [ [A, B, C] ].But according to the sample explanation, in the second test case, the first pile is built by adding each subsequent card to the left pile. For example, 2C is moved to AC, then 3C to 2C&#39;s pile (which is now AC, 2C), so the pile becomes AC, 2C, 3C.But according to this, moving a card appends it to the target pile. So the target pile&#39;s top is the newly added card. So in this case, when 2C is moved to AC&#39;s pile, the pile becomes [AC, 2C], and the top is 2C. Then, 3C is moved to 2C&#39;s pile (the same pile), making it [AC, 2C, 3C], and the top is 3C.So, the model is that when a card is moved to a pile, it&#39;s added to the end of that pile&#39;s list, becoming the new top. The source pile is then removed (since it was only that card). Wait, but the source pile was part of the list. So, perhaps each pile in the list is a single card, but when merged, they are combined into a single pile. So when you have a pile at position i, and you move its top card to position j, then pile j&#39;s list is appended with that card. The pile i is then removed (since it&#39;s empty now). But if pile i had more than one card, then after moving the top card, it would have one less. But according to the problem statement, when you move a card, you can only move the top card of a pile. So the source pile must have at least one card. After moving, if the pile has zero cards, it&#39;s removed and the list is shifted.But how can a pile have multiple cards? Only if other piles are merged into it. So, for example, the first pile starts as [AC], then 2C is added as a new pile. Then, since 2C matches AC (same suit?), it&#39;s moved to the first pile, resulting in [AC, 2C]. Then 3C is added as a new pile. Since 3C matches 2C, it&#39;s moved to the first pile, which becomes [AC, 2C, 3C], etc.So in this model, each time a new card is dealt, it&#39;s added as a new pile (with one card). Then, the merging process checks for possible moves. When a pile (i) is moved to another pile (j), the entire pile (i) is merged into j. But that would mean j&#39;s top is the same as i&#39;s top. So, perhaps the merging is done by appending the entire i pile to j&#39;s pile.Wait, but that would not make sense. Because in the sample explanation, when 2C is moved to AC, then 3C is moved to 2C. But if after moving 2C to AC, the AC pile becomes [AC, 2C], then when 3C is added as a new pile, it can be moved to 2C (the left neighbor), which is now in the same pile. So moving 3C to the left neighbor (which is the AC pile) would append 3C to it.But according to the problem&#39;s rules, after moving, the piles are shifted. So when you move a pile, the gap is closed.Wait, perhaps each pile is a list of cards. The top card is the last element. When a card is moved, it is added to the target pile&#39;s list. The source pile is then removed from the list (since it&#39;s now empty). Because after moving the top card, the source pile would have no cards left (assuming the source pile had only one card). Wait, but if the source pile had more than one card, then moving the top card would leave the pile with the remaining cards, but that&#39;s not allowed because only the top card can be moved.Ah! Here&#39;s the key point: Each pile is a stack of cards. Only the top card can be moved. So when you move the top card of a pile, it&#39;s taken from that pile and added to the target pile. The source pile now has one less card. If the source pile becomes empty after that, it&#39;s removed. Otherwise, the pile remains with the remaining cards.So for example, if a pile has [A, B, C], the top is C. If C is moved to another pile, the source pile becomes [A, B], and the target pile gains C. Then, the next time the source pile is processed, the top is B, which can be moved if possible.But according to the problem statement, &quot;He can move only the top card of each pile at any given time.&quot; So, whenever you move a card, it&#39;s the top card. So the source pile is modified by removing the top card.But in the sample explanation, when they move 2C to AC, then 3C to 2C, etc., the pile accumulates the cards in order. So, each time a card is moved, it&#39;s added to the target pile&#39;s top. So the target pile&#39;s top is the new card.This suggests that when you move a card from pile i to pile j, pile j appends that card to its list (making it the new top), and pile i&#39;s list is shortened by one.So, the code would model each pile as a list. To move a card from pile i to pile j:pile_j.append(pile_i.pop())If pile_i is now empty, remove it from the list of piles.But how do we handle the indices after such an operation?For example, suppose we have piles [p0, p1, p2, p3]. We are checking p3. If p3 can move to p2 (i-1=2), then after moving, p3&#39;s top is popped and added to p2. If p3&#39;s list is now empty, then we remove it. So the list becomes [p0, p1, p2], and the next iteration starts from the beginning.Alternatively, if the source pile still has cards after moving the top card, it remains in the list. But that complicates things because the next move could involve the same pile again.But according to the problem statement&#39;s sample explanation, once a card is dealt and merged into a pile, the next cards are dealt as new piles. So perhaps in the simulation, each new card is added as a new pile (one card). Then, during the merging process, the possible moves are checked, and when a pile&#39;s top is moved, that pile is removed (since it&#39;s now empty). Because the initial piles are single-card piles, and merging would combine them into larger piles. So perhaps when a pile&#39;s top is moved, the pile is removed, and the target pile gains the moved card. So the model is:Each pile is a list of cards, where the top is the last element. When you move a card from pile i to pile j, you pop the last element of pile i and append it to pile j. If pile i becomes empty, remove it from the list.But in this case, after moving, the source pile i is removed (if empty). So when a new card is added, it&#39;s a new pile. Then, during the merging steps, the code checks each pile (left to right) to see if its top can be moved to left neighbor or third left. If yes, move it (the top card) to the target pile, and if the source is empty, remove it. Then, the entire list is restructured, and the scanning starts from the beginning.So, the steps for dealing a new card:1. Add the new card as a new pile (a list with one element) to the end of the piles list.2. Then, enter a loop where we scan the piles from left to right (i=0 to len(piles)-1). For each i:   a. Check if i &gt;=1. If so, check if the top card of pile i matches the top card of pile i-1. If yes:      i. Move the top card from pile i to pile i-1.      ii. If pile i is now empty, remove it from the list.      iii. Break the loop and restart the scanning from the beginning (since the list has changed).   b. If not, check if i &gt;=3. If so, check if the top card of pile i matches the top card of pile i-3. If yes:      i. Move the top card from pile i to pile i-3.      ii. If pile i is now empty, remove it.      iii. Break and restart.3. Repeat this process until no more moves can be made.This seems manageable. Now, how to represent the piles in Python.Each pile is a list (or a deque, but lists are easier for popping from the end). The list of piles is a list of lists.For example:piles = [[card1], [card2], ... ]When a new card is dealt, append [new_card] to piles.Then, in the loop:for i in range(len(piles)):   if i &gt;= 1:      if can_move(piles[i][-1], piles[i-1][-1]):          # move top of i to i-1          moved_card = piles[i].pop()          piles[i-1].append(moved_card)          if len(piles[i]) == 0:              del piles[i]          else:              # the pile i still exists, but now has one less card.              # but after moving, the next card is the new top, but in this step, we can&#39;t process further until the next iteration.          # restart the loop          moved = True          break   if not moved and i &gt;=3:      # check third left      if can_move(piles[i][-1], piles[i-3][-1]):          # move top of i to i-3          moved_card = piles[i].pop()          piles[i-3].append(moved_card)          if len(piles[i]) == 0:              del piles[i]          moved = True          breakIf during the for loop, a move is made, then after breaking, the loop restarts from the beginning.But how to manage the indices after deletion?For example, if we have piles at positions 0,1,2,3. If during i=3, we move to i-3=0. Then, after moving, the pile at 3 is popped. So the list becomes [0,1,2]. But after that, the next iteration will start from i=0 again.But in the code, after a move is made and the piles list is modified, the for loop breaks and starts again. So each time a move is made, the code restarts the scanning from i=0.This approach should work.Now, the function can_move(card1, card2) checks if the two cards have the same suit or same rank.So, card1 and card2 are two-character strings. The first character is the rank, the second is the suit.So:def can_move(card1, card2):    return card1[0] == card2[0] or card1[1] == card2[1]Now, the steps for handling each test case:Each test case is two lines (each with 26 cards, making 52 total). So read two lines, split into 26 each, combine into a list of 52 cards.For each test case:Initialize piles as an empty list.For each card in the 52-card list:   add it as a new pile (append [card] to piles)   then, process the possible moves:      while True:          moved = False          for i in range(len(piles)):              # check left neighbor (i-1)              if i &gt;= 1:                  if can_move(piles[i][-1], piles[i-1][-1]):                      # move the top of i to i-1                      moved_card = piles[i].pop()                      piles[i-1].append(moved_card)                      # if pile i is now empty, remove it                      if len(piles[i]) == 0:                          del piles[i]                      else:                          # pile i still exists, but after deleting, the indices change                          # wait, after popping from piles[i], if the pile is not empty, but in the loop, after moving, the code breaks and restarts.                          # but in this code, after popping, if the pile is not empty, the del is not done. But the code will check the same pile again in the next iteration?                          # for example: piles[i] has two cards. moving the top, so now it has one. Then, when we delete the current i from the list?No. Because in the code above, after popping from piles[i], if the pile is not empty, we do not delete it. So the code continues.Wait, no. Let&#39;s look at the code again.After moving the top card from pile i to pile i-1:if len(piles[i]) == 0:   del piles[i]else:   pass (so the pile remains in the list, but with one less card)But after moving the card, the piles list is modified. For example, if the pile i was not empty after popping, then after moving, the code breaks and the for loop is restarted.But in the code as written, when you have a pile with two cards, and you move the top one, the pile now has one card. The code does not delete it. So during the next iteration, when the code scans the piles again, this pile (now with one card) is still present. However, during the next scan, the code will check if this pile&#39;s top can be moved.But this is incorrect because the problem statement says that you can only move the top card of each pile. So after moving a card from a pile, if the pile is not empty, its top is now the previous card, which can be moved again if possible. But according to the problem statement&#39;s rules, each time you deal a card, you process all possible moves. So after dealing a card and moving, you process any possible moves in the entire list, which may include multiple moves on the same pile (if after moving one card, another card becomes the top and can be moved again).But the sample explanation suggests that after each card is dealt, you process all possible moves, which may involve multiple steps.Wait, in the sample explanation, when dealing the 2C after AC, the 2C is moved to AC. Then, when the next card (3C) is dealt, it&#39;s moved to 2C&#39;s pile. So each card is processed after being dealt.So the process is: after dealing a new card (as a new pile), process all possible moves, which may involve moving cards left as far as possible. This can include moving multiple times (e.g., moving a card, which allows a previous pile to be moved again).But according to the code&#39;s structure, after adding a new card, the code enters a loop where it scans the list from left to right, and whenever a move is made, the process restarts. This ensures that all possible moves are made, including those that become possible after earlier moves.So the code should handle that.But in the code above, after moving a card from pile i to i-1 (and i is not empty), the code does not delete pile i. So pile i is still in the list, but with one less card. Then, in the next iteration of the loop, when the code restarts scanning from the beginning, it may process this pile again.For example, pile i had two cards. After moving one, it has one. In the next scan, pile i is now at a different index if any piles before it were deleted. So this approach should be correct.But let&#39;s test with the sample input.Sample Input 2:The second test case is the AC 2C 3C ... line.The first line is a sorted list of clubs, then diamonds, etc.After dealing each card, the code checks for possible moves. For example, after dealing AC, nothing can be done. Then, dealing 2C: check if 2C can be moved to left (AC). Since same suit, yes. Move, so the piles are [AC, 2C]. Then, process possible moves again. But in the code, after moving, the code restarts the scan. Now, the pile 0 (AC, 2C) is followed by 3C (the next card). Wait, no. Wait, the code for each card is: process the card by adding to piles, then process all possible moves. So the test case&#39;s second input is:AC 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KC AD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D TD 9D JD QD KDAH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H KH 6S QH TH AS 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KSSo each line is 26 cards. Combined, 52.So when dealing each card in order:First card AC: piles = [[AC]]Second card 2C: added as new pile [[AC], [2C]]Check for moves:i=1 (piles[1] is [2C]). Check left neighbor i=0 (AC). Same suit. So move 2C to AC&#39;s pile. Now, piles becomes [[AC, 2C]]. Then, restart scan. No more moves.Third card 3C: added as new pile [[AC, 2C], [3C]]Check for moves:i=1. Left neighbor i=0. Check top (3C vs 2C). Same suit. Move. Now, piles becomes [[AC, 2C, 3C]]Repeat the process. Each time, the next card is added, and moved to the left neighbor (which is the same pile now).This seems to work.Another example from the sample explanation: after dealing KD (the 26th card), then the diamonds are processed. Then, dealing AH, 2H, etc. After merging the diamonds, the code moves KD to KC (third left?), which would be the KC pile.But how does that work?Hmm, but according to the code, when a new card is added, the code checks possible moves. For example, after adding a new card, the code checks if it can be moved to the left neighbor or third left.Wait, but the code for each new card is:- add as new pile (so the list of piles is increased by one).- then, process all possible moves (including any that may involve this new pile and previous ones).So after each new card is added, all possible moves are processed, which may involve moving multiple times.Now, the code structure for the entire problem would be:Read input lines until a line starting with &#39;#&#39;.For each pair of lines (each representing 26 cards), process as follows:   Combine the two lines into a list of 52 cards.   Initialize piles as empty list.   for card in cards:       add [card] to piles.       process possible moves:           while True:               moved = False               for i in range(len(piles)):                   # check left neighbor (i-1)                   if i &gt;= 1:                       if can_move(piles[i][-1], piles[i-1][-1]):                           # move top of i to i-1                           moved_card = piles[i].pop()                           piles[i-1].append(moved_card)                           # check if pile i is now empty                           if len(piles[i]) == 0:                               del piles[i]                           else:                               # pile i remains but with one less card                               pass                           moved = True                           # restart the loop from the beginning                           break                   # if not moved, check third left (i-3)                   if not moved and i &gt;=3:                       if can_move(piles[i][-1], piles[i-3][-1]):                           # move top of i to i-3                           moved_card = piles[i].pop()                           piles[i-3].append(moved_card)                           if len(piles[i]) ==0:                               del piles[i]                           moved = True                           break               if not moved:                   break   After processing all cards, output the number of piles and their sizes.Wait, but in this code, when you process a move, after popping from pile i, you have to check if pile i is empty. If it is, you delete it. But when you delete pile i, the list of piles changes. So in the for loop, after a move is made and the list is modified, the loop breaks and restarts.But there&#39;s a problem here: in the code above, when you are processing pile i, and you delete it, the indices of the piles after i are shifted left by one. So during the current iteration of the for loop, the i variable would not account for this. However, since the code breaks out of the for loop as soon as a move is made, and restarts the loop from the beginning, this should be handled correctly.Yes. For example, if during iteration i=5, a move is made and pile 5 is deleted. The for loop breaks, and the next iteration of the while loop starts from i=0 again.So the code should correctly handle the dynamic list of piles.Now, the edge cases: when a pile has multiple cards. For example, a pile has two cards. Moving the top card leaves one. Then, during the next scan, this pile&#39;s new top may be checked for possible moves.But according to the code, this is handled.Another edge case: when a pile is moved to the third left, and after moving, the third left pile&#39;s top is now different, allowing for other moves.But the code will restart the scan, so it will pick up any new possibilities.Now, the final step is to output the number of piles and the sizes of each pile in order.Once all cards are processed, for each test case, output the number of piles followed by the sizes of each pile.For example, the first sample output is 6 40 8 1 1 1 1. So 6 piles, with sizes 40,8,1,1,1,1.So the code needs to collect the lengths of each pile in the order they appear after processing.So after processing all cards, the code can collect [len(p) for p in piles].Now, testing this code with the sample input.Sample Input 2:The second test case in the sample input is the one that results in a single pile of 52 cards. The explanation says that all cards are merged into one pile. So the code needs to process all moves correctly.But how does that happen?In this case, the first line is all clubs in order, then diamonds in order, etc. So when each card is dealt, it can be moved to the left neighbor. For example:After dealing AC, nothing. Then 2C is added, moved to AC. Then 3C is added, moved to 2C, and so on. So after processing the first 13 cards (clubs), the first pile has 13 cards. Then, the next 13 cards are diamonds, each added as a new pile and moved to the left neighbor. So the diamonds are merged into the first pile. Then, the next cards are hearts, then spades.But according to the explanation, after dealing the diamonds, the diamonds&#39; pile is merged into the clubs&#39; pile. Then, when dealing the hearts, each is added and moved to the left neighbor (the merged pile). Finally, spades are dealt and merged.But according to the code, each time a new card is added, it&#39;s a new pile. Then, the code checks if it can be moved to the left neighbor or third left.So for the hearts and spades, after merging into the left pile, the code would append each new card to the main pile.In this way, all cards are merged into a single pile.So the code should correctly handle this scenario.Now, the code needs to read the input lines properly. Each test case is two lines of 26 cards, followed by a line with &#39;#&#39;.So the code should read lines until it finds a line starting with &#39;#&#39;. For each pair of lines (two consecutive lines before the &#39;#&#39;) as a test case.So the code will:Read all lines from stdin until a line starts with &#39;#&#39;. Then, group the lines into pairs. Each pair forms a test case.For example, the sample input has two test cases (each with two lines of 26 cards), then a line with &#39;#&#39;.So, the code can read all lines (excluding the last line with &#39;#&#39;) and process them two at a time.Now, the code will:Read all lines, split into pairs, then process each pair.In Python, this can be done by reading all lines, stripping whitespace, and then grouping them into pairs. For example:import syslines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip() != &#39;#&#39;]Then, for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):   line1 = lines[i]   line2 = lines[i+1]   cards = line1.split() + line2.split()Process these cards.Now, the code can be written as:Read all lines, split into pairs, process each pair.Now, putting it all together:The function will process each test case, and for each, output the number of piles followed by their sizes.Now, let&#39;s write the code.First, the can_move function.Then, the processing of each test case.Then, reading the input and calling the function.But the code must be written as a function that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.So, the code:import sysdef can_move(card1, card2):    return card1[0] == card2[0] or card1[1] == card2[1]def process_test_case(cards):    piles = []    for card in cards:        # Add new pile        piles.append([card])        # Process moves        while True:            moved = False            for i in range(len(piles)):                # Check left neighbor (i-1)                if i &gt;= 1:                    if can_move(piles[i][-1], piles[i-1][-1]):                        # Move top of i to i-1                        moved_card = piles[i].pop()                        piles[i-1].append(moved_card)                        if len(piles[i]) == 0:                            del piles[i]                        else:                            # i is now i-1&#39;s next, but since we break, the loop restarts                            pass                        moved = True                        break                if moved:                    break                # Check third left (i-3)                if i &gt;= 3:                    if can_move(piles[i][-1], piles[i-3][-1]):                        # Move top of i to i-3                        moved_card = piles[i].pop()                        piles[i-3].append(moved_card)                        if len(piles[i]) == 0:                            del piles[i]                        else:                            pass                        moved = True                        break                if moved:                    break            if not moved:                break    # Prepare the output    sizes = [len(pile) for pile in piles]    return f&quot;{len(sizes)} &quot; + &quot; &quot;.join(map(str, sizes))def main():    input_lines = []    for line in sys.stdin:        if line.strip() == &#39;#&#39;:            break        input_lines.append(line.strip())    # Process test cases in pairs    test_cases = []    for i in range(0, len(input_lines), 2):        line1 = input_lines[i]        line2 = input_lines[i+1]        cards = line1.split() + line2.split()        test_cases.append(cards)    for cards in test_cases:        result = process_test_case(cards)        print(result)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()Wait, but in the sample input, each test case is two lines. So the code reads all lines up to &#39;#&#39;, then groups them into pairs. So for the sample input, which has two test cases (each with two lines), the code will process them correctly.Testing this code with the sample input.Sample Input:QD AD 8H 5S 3H 5H TC 4D JH KS 6H 8S JS AC AS 8D 2H QS TS 3S AH 4H TH TD 3C 6S8C 7D 4C 4S 7S 9H 7C 5D 2S KD 2D QH JD 6D 9D JC 2C KH 3D QC 6C 9S KC 7H 9C 5CAC 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KC AD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D TD 9D JD QD KDAH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H KH 6S QH TH AS 2S 3S 4S 5S JH 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS#The first test case is the first two lines. The code combines them into 52 cards. The process_test_case function processes them, leading to 6 piles. The code should output 6 followed by their sizes.The second test case is the next two lines, which combine into 52 cards. The code processes them and outputs 1 52.But in the sample output, the first test case&#39;s output is 6 40 8 1 1 1 1. The code&#39;s process_test_case function returns the number of piles and the sizes in order.But according to the code, after processing all cards, the piles are collected as [len(pile) for pile in piles], which is the correct order.Now, possible issues with the code:1. When moving a card from i to i-1, the code deletes the pile i if empty. But after deleting, the indices change, but the code breaks and restarts the loop. So this should be correct.2. Handling third left moves. For example, when a card is added at position i, and can be moved to i-3. For example, i=3. So i-3=0. Moving the card from 3 to 0. Then, deleting pile 3 (if empty). So after moving, the list is adjusted.But in the code, after moving, the loop breaks and restarts.Another possible issue is when a pile has multiple cards. For example, if a pile has two cards, and the top is moved. The remaining card is now the new top. The code may process it again in the next iterations.But according to the problem statement, this is allowed. For example, after dealing a new card and merging, any possible moves (including moves of previous piles) are processed.So the code should handle that.Testing the code with the second sample test case:All cards are ordered such that each subsequent card can be moved to the left neighbor. So after each new card is added, it is merged into the previous pile. So the first pile grows to 13 cards (clubs), then diamonds are added and merged into the same pile. Then hearts, then spades.But wait, when diamonds are added, each diamond is a new pile. But the code will process each new card as it&#39;s added. So for example, after dealing AD (the first diamond), it&#39;s added as a new pile. Then, the code checks if it can be moved. At that time, there are 14 piles (13 clubs merged into one, then AD as a new pile). So during processing AD, the code checks if AD can be moved to the left neighbor (which is the club pile&#39;s last card, KC). AD&#39;s suit is diamonds, which is different from KC&#39;s suit (clubs). But the left neighbor&#39;s top is KC. So no, same suit? No. Then, check third left (i-3). For the AD pile (i=13), i-3=10. The third left is the 10th pile (which is part of the club pile?). No, after the club pile has been merged into a single pile, the first 13 cards were merged into one pile. So when the AD is added as a new pile, the piles list is:pile 0: [AC, 2C, ..., KC] (13 cards)pile 1: [AD]Now, after adding AD, the code enters the move processing loop.For i=1 (AD&#39;s pile):i &gt;=1 (yes, i=1). Check if AD&#39;s top (AD) matches pile 0&#39;s top (KC). AD&#39;s suit is D, KC&#39;s suit is C. Ranks are A and K. Not same. So no.i &gt;=3? 1 &gt;=3 is no. So no move.So AD remains as a separate pile.Then, next card is 2D. Added as pile 2. Now, check moves:i=2 (2D). Check i-1=1 (AD). 2D&#39;s suit is D, AD&#39;s suit is D. So same suit. So move 2D to AD&#39;s pile. Now, pile 1 becomes [AD, 2D]. pile 2 is deleted (since after moving the top card, it&#39;s empty).Then, the code restarts the scan.For the new AD, 2D pile, when the next card 3D is added as a new pile (now i=2 again?), and so on. Each time a new diamond is added, it&#39;s moved to the left neighbor (the previous diamond pile).So after processing all diamonds, the first pile is 13 clubs, and the second pile is 13 diamonds.Then, when the next card is AH (hearts), added as a new pile. It can&#39;t be moved to the previous pile (KD&#39;s suit is D, AH is H). So no move. Then, the next card 2H is added. Check if it can be moved to AH&#39;s pile. Same suit. Yes. So 2H is merged into AH. Then 3H is added, merged into 2H&#39;s pile, and so on.But after all hearts are processed, they form a single pile. Then, when the next card is KH (king of hearts), added and merged into the previous hearts pile.Wait, but according to the sample explanation, after processing the diamonds, the diamonds&#39; pile is moved onto the clubs&#39; pile. But according to the code, how does that happen?Ah, the sample explanation says that after the diamonds are dealt, the code moves the diamonds&#39; pile to the clubs&#39; pile. But according to the code, each diamond is added and merged into the previous diamond&#39;s pile, forming a separate pile. Then, when the next diamond is added, the previous diamond pile is merged into the clubs&#39; pile?No, that&#39;s not how the code works. Let&#39;s see.After processing all clubs (13 cards), the first pile is all clubs. Then, the diamonds are added one by one.When AD is added, it&#39;s a new pile. No move possible. Then, 2D is added. It can be moved to AD (same suit). So merged into AD. Then 3D is added. Can be moved to 2D&#39;s pile. So merged. Continue until all diamonds are added. So after processing all diamonds, the diamonds are a single pile. Then, the code would have two piles: clubs and diamonds.But how do they merge?The sample explanation says that after the diamonds are dealt, their pile is moved to the clubs&#39; pile. So during the processing of the diamonds&#39; cards, after the last diamond is added (KD), the code would check if it can be moved to the third left (the clubs&#39; pile).Wait, after adding KD, which is the 26th card (assuming diamonds are the next 13 cards after clubs). Let&#39;s see:After dealing all diamonds, the code has two piles: clubs (13 cards) and diamonds (13 cards).Then, when the next card is AH (hearts), added as a new pile. So the piles are:[clubs], [diamonds], [AH]Check if AH can be moved to diamonds. Suit H vs D. No. Check third left (i=2, i-3 = -1). No. So no move.Then, the code adds 2H. It can be moved to AH&#39;s pile. So merged.Then, after processing all hearts, the hearts are merged into a single pile. Then, when the next card is 6S (spade), added as a new pile. Can&#39;t be moved to hearts.But according to the sample explanation, after processing the diamonds, when the code moves the diamonds&#39; pile to the clubs&#39; pile. How does this happen?Ah, the sample explanation says:&quot;Now he moves Pile of KD to KC&quot;The KD pile is the diamonds&#39; pile. The KC is the top of the clubs&#39; pile.So, when the diamonds&#39; pile is processed, after all diamonds are merged into a single pile, the code may merge that pile into the clubs&#39; pile via a third-left move.But according to the code, after adding each card, the code processes all possible moves.So when the last diamond (KD) is added as a new pile:After adding KD, the code processes possible moves.At this point, the piles are:[clubs (13), diamonds (12), KD]Wait, no. Let&#39;s walk through:When adding the 13th diamond (KD), the previous diamonds have been processed.For example:After adding AD, 2D, 3D, ... QD, KD.When adding KD as the last diamond, the code will process it as follows:Add KD as a new pile. Then, check moves:Current piles are:clubs (13), diamonds (12 cards), and KD (new pile).So i=2 (KD&#39;s pile). Check left neighbor (i=1, diamonds pile&#39;s top is QD). KD and QD: same suit (D), so move. So KD is moved to diamonds&#39; pile. Now, diamonds&#39; pile has 13 cards. The KD pile is removed.So after processing all diamonds, the piles are [clubs, diamonds (13)].Then, when the next card is AH (the first of the hearts), added as a new pile. It can&#39;t be moved to diamonds&#39; pile (D vs H). Then, 2H is added, merged into AH. Then 3H into 2H, etc.But according to the sample explanation, after diamonds are processed, the code moves the diamonds&#39; pile to the clubs&#39; pile. So when does that happen?Ah, perhaps after all diamonds are merged into a single pile, the code then moves that pile&#39;s top card to the third left.But according to the code, after each card is added, all possible moves are processed. So after adding the last diamond (KD), the code processes moves:KD is added as a new pile. Check if it can be moved to left neighbor (diamonds pile&#39;s top is QD). Same suit (D), so move. Now, diamonds pile&#39;s top is KD. Then, after moving, the code restarts the scan.Then, during the next iteration, the diamonds pile is i=1. Check if it can be moved to left neighbor (i=0, clubs&#39; top is KC). Same suit? D vs C. No. Check third left (i-3 = 1-3 = -2). No. So no move.Thus, the diamonds&#39; pile remains as a separate pile.But according to the sample explanation, the diamonds&#39; pile is moved to the clubs&#39; pile. So why does that happen?Ah, perhaps the code is missing something. According to the sample explanation, after all diamonds are dealt, the code processes the entire list of piles (clubs and diamonds) and merges them.But according to the code&#39;s logic, the diamonds are processed one by one. Each time a new diamond is added, it&#39;s merged into the previous diamond&#39;s pile. So after the last diamond (KD) is added, it&#39;s merged into the previous diamond&#39;s pile (QD), creating a diamonds pile of 13 cards.Then, when the next card (AH) is added, it&#39;s a new pile. But how do the diamonds&#39; pile and clubs&#39; pile merge?The code would only merge if a move is possible when a new card is added.Ah, perhaps the code is missing the step where after merging all diamonds into a single pile, that pile can be moved to the clubs&#39; pile. But according to the code&#39;s logic, this can only happen if there&#39;s a move possible after adding a new card. But after the diamonds are merged into their own pile, no new card has been added, so the code doesn&#39;t process any moves.Wait, the code processes moves only after adding a new card. So after all 52 cards are dealt, the code has processed moves after each addition. But once all cards are dealt, the code doesn&#39;t process any further moves. So the diamonds&#39; pile and clubs&#39; pile would only be merged if, during the processing of a new card (like the first heart), a move is possible.For example, after adding the AH (card 27), the code checks if it can be moved. Then, after processing, the code may move the diamonds&#39; pile to the clubs&#39; pile if possible.But how?The diamonds&#39; pile is at i=1, clubs at i=0. After adding AH, piles are [clubs, diamonds, AH]. Then, processing moves:Check each pile (0,1,2). For i=1 (diamonds), check left neighbor (i=0, clubs). The top is KD and KC. Same suit? D vs C. No. Same rank? K vs K. Yes! Oh! Because KC (King of Clubs) and KD (King of Diamonds) have the same rank (K). So when processing the diamonds&#39; pile (i=1), can it be moved to i=0 (clubs&#39; pile) via the left neighbor?Yes! So the code would move the diamonds&#39; pile&#39;s top (KD) to the clubs&#39; pile.But when is this move processed?After adding the AH (card 27), the code processes moves. So the piles are [clubs, diamonds, AH]. During the move processing loop:For i=0: no moves.For i=1 (diamonds):Check left neighbor (i=0). The top cards are KD (diamonds) and KC (clubs). They have the same rank (K), so can_move returns True.So the code would move KD from i=1 to i=0.So the code pops KD from diamonds and appends to clubs. Then, since the diamonds pile is now empty, it&#39;s deleted. So the piles become [clubs (now 14 cards), AH]. Then, the code restarts the scan.Now, check i=1 (AH). Can it be moved to clubs? AH&#39;s suit is H. clubs&#39; top is KD, suit D. No. So no move.Thus, after adding AH, the code moves the diamonds&#39; pile into clubs.But this would happen during the processing of the first heart card (AH), which is after all diamonds are dealt.So the code would correctly merge the diamonds into the clubs&#39; pile during the processing of the first heart card.Thus, the code is correct.So, the code should handle all cases correctly.Finally, the code reads the input lines, processes each test case, and outputs the required results.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to simulate a card game where Samwell deals cards one by one and moves them to the left if they match either the immediate left neighbor or the third left neighbor. The goal is to determine the number of piles and their sizes after all possible moves are made. Approach1. Input Handling: Read input lines until encountering a line starting with `#`. Each pair of lines represents a deck of 52 cards.2. Card Movement Simulation:   - Initialization: Start with an empty list of piles.   - Dealing Cards: For each card, add it as a new pile and check for possible moves.   - Move Processing: After each card is dealt, check each pile from left to right. If a pile can move to the immediate left neighbor or the third left neighbor (based on same suit or rank), move the top card of the current pile to the target pile. Remove the source pile if it becomes empty.3. Output: After processing all cards, output the number of piles and their sizes.

Reading Input: The input is read line by line until a line starting with `#` is encountered. Each pair of lines forms a test case.2. Processing Each Test Case:   - Dealing Cards: Each card is added as a new pile. After each addition, possible moves are checked.   - Checking Moves: For each pile, check if it can move to the immediate left neighbor or the third left neighbor. If a move is possible, the top card is moved, and the source pile is removed if empty.3. Output: After processing all cards, the number of piles and their sizes are printed.This approach ensures that all possible moves are processed in the correct order, and the game rules are followed strictly to determine the final state of the piles.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-cebbdad3 data-v-2e624778><div class="review" data-v-2e624778><div class="review-title" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>❓:</span>Read problem statements in [Mandarin Chinese], [Russian], and [Vietnamese] as well.You are given a sequence A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{N}.

Let&#39;s read the problem statement carefully.So, the problem is about handling two types of queries on an array. The first type adds a certain squared value to a range of elements, and the second type asks for the value at a specific index. The constraints are up to 1e5 for N and Q, which means that a naive approach with O(Q*N) time complexity will not work. I need an efficient way to handle these range updates and point queries.Let&#39;s break down the first type of query. For each i between L and R, we add (X + i - L)^2 to A[i]. Let&#39;s expand that squared term. (X + (i - L))^2 is X² + 2X(i-L) + (i-L)^2. So each element in the range L..R gets added X² plus 2X times (i-L) plus (i-L) squared.Hmm. So the update for each element in the range can be written as:A[i] += X² + 2X*(i-L) + (i-L)^2.Wait, let&#39;s compute that again. (X + (i-L))^2 is X² + 2X(i-L) + (i-L)^2. So when you add this to A[i], each term contributes to the sum. But for a range update, adding terms that can be expressed as functions of i might be possible using prefix sums or difference arrays.The challenge here is that the added value depends on the position i in the range. So each element in L..R is modified by a quadratic function of (i-L). This complicates things because it&#39;s not a constant value added over the range.Let me think about how to model this. Let&#39;s represent each update as adding a quadratic function over the range [L, R]. The quadratic function is a function of i, which is the position in the array. So for each update of type 1, the added value to A[i] can be written as a quadratic in terms of (i), such as a*i² + b*i + c, but perhaps expressed in terms of (i-L) as done before.But how can I represent these additive quadratic terms efficiently? Because if I have multiple such updates, each contributes their own terms, and when querying a point Y, I need to compute the sum of all these quadratic contributions that affect Y.Wait, the initial array is given, and then each update is a function added over a range. So for any element Y, its current value is the initial value plus the sum of all the contributions from the updates that include Y in their ranges.So the problem reduces to, for each query of type 2, compute the initial A[Y] plus the sum of all (X + (i-L))² for each update (L, R, X) where L ≤ Y ≤ R. But how to compute this sum efficiently.The key is to model each update&#39;s contribution as a quadratic function in terms of i, and then for each query Y, compute the sum of all such quadratic functions evaluated at i=Y, but only for those updates that include Y in their ranges.So for each update (L, R, X), the added term for i in [L, R] is (X + (i - L))^2 = X² + 2X*(i - L) + (i - L)^2. Let&#39;s expand this further:i-L is (i - L). Let&#39;s substitute k = i - L. Then, the term becomes X² + 2Xk + k². Since k = i - L, when i ranges from L to R, k ranges from 0 to (R-L). So for a given i, the term is (X + (i - L))^2.Expressed as a function of i, this is:(X + (i - L))² = (X - L + i)² = (i + (X - L))².Wait, that&#39;s (i + (X - L)) squared. Expanding this:i² + 2i*(X - L) + (X - L)^2.But this is only valid for i between L and R. So for each update, the contribution to A[i] is this quadratic function, but only within the range [L, R].So the problem is to manage multiple range updates where each update adds a quadratic function (a*i² + b*i + c) to a range [L, R], and then answer point queries for the sum of all these functions at a particular Y.But how can we represent these quadratic functions in a way that allows us to compute the sum quickly?In the case of linear or quadratic range updates, we can use prefix sums with coefficients. For example, for each quadratic function a*i² + b*i + c over a range [L, R], we can model the contributions to the coefficients a, b, c. Then, for any Y, the total contribution is the sum of a_i * Y² + b_i * Y + c_i for all ranges that include Y.So the idea is to represent each update as adding certain coefficients in the ranges where they apply. For example, for the quadratic term i², each update contributes 1*i² for the range [L, R]. For the linear term, it contributes 2*(X - L)*i, and for the constant term, it contributes (X - L)^2 + X² - ... Wait, wait. Let&#39;s re-express the quadratic function correctly.Wait, the original expansion for (X + (i-L))^2 is X² + 2X(i-L) + (i-L)^2. Let&#39;s expand that:X² + 2X*(i-L) + (i^2 - 2Li + L²) = X² + 2Xi - 2XL + i² - 2Li + L².Combine terms:i² + (2X - 2L)i + (X² - 2XL + L²).Alternatively, group the terms in terms of i², i, and constants:Coefficient of i²: 1.Coefficient of i: 2(X - L).Constant term: X² - 2XL + L² = (X - L)^2.So the quadratic function is i² + 2(X - L)*i + (X - L)^2.Wait, that&#39;s (X + (i - L))^2 = (i + (X - L))^2. Which when expanded is i² + 2(X-L)i + (X-L)^2. Yes.So each update adds to the range [L, R] the function f(i) = i² * 1 + i * 2(X - L) + (X-L)^2.So to model this, for each update, we need to add 1 to the a coefficient (for i²), 2(X-L) to the b coefficient (for i), and (X-L)^2 to the c coefficient (constant term) for all positions i in [L, R].If we can track for each position Y, the sum of a coefficients from all applicable updates, sum of b coefficients, and sum of c coefficients, then the total contribution from all updates is sum_a * Y² + sum_b * Y + sum_c.So the value A[Y] is equal to the initial A[Y] plus sum_a * Y² + sum_b * Y + sum_c.Therefore, the problem reduces to, for each update of type 1, add 1 to a in [L, R], 2(X-L) to b in [L, R], and (X-L)^2 to c in [L, R]. Then, for a query of type 2, compute the initial value plus a[Y] * Y² + b[Y] * Y + c[Y].But how do we perform these range updates efficiently? Because with N and Q up to 1e5, we need O(1) or O(log N) per query.The standard approach for range updates and point queries is using a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick tree) or a Segment Tree with lazy propagation. However, since we have three separate coefficients (a, b, c), each needing their own range updates, we need a way to handle each of them.Each coefficient (a, b, c) is being updated with a certain value over a range. So for example, the a coefficient for a given update is 1, added to the entire range [L, R]. The b coefficient is 2*(X - L), added to the same range. The c coefficient is (X - L)^2, added to the same range.So for each of a, b, c, we can maintain a prefix sum array (or a binary indexed tree that supports range updates and point queries). Then, for a query Y, the sum_a is the sum of all a updates that include Y in their ranges, similarly for sum_b and sum_c.Yes. So the plan is:- Maintain three separate Fenwick trees (or binary indexed trees) for a, b, c.- For a type 1 query (L, R, X):   a. The a coefficient is 1, so we add 1 to the a_tree in the range [L, R].   b. The b coefficient is 2*(X - L), so add 2*(X - L) to the b_tree in [L, R].   c. The c coefficient is (X - L)^2, add this to the c_tree in [L, R].- For a type 2 query (Y):   a. Compute sum_a = a_tree.query(Y)   b. sum_b = b_tree.query(Y)   c. sum_c = c_tree.query(Y)   d. The result is initial_A[Y] + sum_a * Y² + sum_b * Y + sum_c.This way, each type 1 query takes O(log N) time for each of the three trees, and each type 2 query takes O(log N) time for each tree.But wait, the Fenwick tree can handle range updates and point queries. So how to perform range updates?Each Fenwick tree (for a, b, c) needs to support range updates (add a value to all elements from L to R). The standard approach for range updates in a Fenwick tree is to perform two point updates: add delta at L, subtract delta at R+1. Then, when querying the prefix sum up to Y, the effect is that all elements from L to R have delta added.Yes. So for a range [L, R], adding delta to all elements can be done with:update(L, delta)update(R+1, -delta)Then, when you compute the prefix sum up to Y, you get the sum of all deltas that have been added to ranges that include Y.Wait, perhaps I need to use a Fenwick tree that can handle range updates and point queries. Let me recall.Fenwick trees can support point updates and prefix sum queries. To handle range updates (add delta to [L, R]), we can model it as a difference array. So for a range [L, R], adding delta to all elements in [L, R] can be done by:BIT.add(L, delta)BIT.add(R+1, -delta)Then, when querying the prefix sum up to Y, the value at Y is the sum of all deltas added to ranges that include Y. Because the prefix sum up to Y in the BIT will include the delta added at L and subtract it after R+1. So for each position Y, the sum is the sum of all deltas where L &lt;= Y &lt;= R.Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the BIT is 1-based. When we perform add(L, delta) and add(R+1, -delta), then the prefix sum at position Y gives the sum of all deltas that were added to ranges starting at L and ending at R &gt;= Y. Or maybe I&#39;m mixing up.Alternatively, perhaps we can use a Fenwick tree that supports range updates and point queries. The standard approach for range add and point query is to use a BIT in a way that allows us to represent the delta applied to a range. For example, adding delta to [L, R] can be represented as adding delta at L, subtracting delta at R+1. Then, the point query for position Y is the prefix sum up to Y. Because when you compute the prefix sum, the delta is added from L onwards. So for Y &lt; L, nothing. For L &lt;= Y &lt;= R, the delta is added. For Y &gt;= R+1, delta is added (from L) and subtracted (at R+1), so net zero. So yes, the prefix sum up to Y gives the sum of all deltas that have been applied to ranges that include Y in [L, R].Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Suppose we have an array of size 5. We add delta=5 to [2,4]. So we do add(2,5) and add(5, -5). Then, the prefix sum up to 1 is 0. Up to 2 is 5. Up to 3 is 5. Up to 4 is 5. Up to 5 is 0 (5 -5). So when you query the point Y=3, which is the sum up to 3, you get 5. Which is correct. So the prefix sum gives the current value at Y. So for each Fenwick tree, the point query for Y is simply the prefix sum up to Y.Therefore, for each of the a, b, c Fenwick trees, when we perform a range update [L, R] by delta, we do:tree.add(L, delta)tree.add(R+1, -delta)Then, when querying the value at Y, we compute the prefix sum up to Y.So, each type 1 query will require three such range updates (for a, b, c), each taking O(log N) time, and each type 2 query requires three prefix sum queries (each O(log N)) and then the computation.Since Q is up to 1e5 and each query is O(log N), this should be feasible.So the steps are:1. Read N and Q.2. Read the initial array A.3. Initialize three Fenwick trees (a_tree, b_tree, c_tree), each of size N.4. For each query:   a. If it&#39;s a type 1 query:      i. L, R, X are given.      ii. Compute delta_a = 1. Add delta_a to a_tree over [L, R].      iii. Compute delta_b = 2*(X - L). Add delta_b to b_tree over [L, R].      iv. Compute delta_c = (X - L)2. Add delta_c to c_tree over [L, R].   b. If it&#39;s a type 2 query:      i. Y is given.      ii. Sum_a = a_tree.query(Y)      iii. Sum_b = b_tree.query(Y)      iv. Sum_c = c_tree.query(Y)      v. The result is A[Y-1] (assuming 0-based initial array) plus sum_a * Y^2 + sum_b * Y + sum_c.      vi. Print this result.Wait, but the initial array is 1-based. So when reading the initial array, we have A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. So in Python, we can store them as a list starting from index 0 (so A[0] is A_1, etc.) or adjust indices accordingly. So during processing, when handling query type 2 for Y, the initial value is the original A[Y-1], assuming 0-based storage.So for example, in the sample input, after the first query (1 1 3 5):The a_tree will have 1 added from L=1 to R=3. Then, for Y=3, the sum_a is 1, sum_b is 2*(5 -1) = 8 (since X=5, L=1, so X-L=4, delta_b is 8) added to [1..3]. So sum_b is 8 for Y=3. sum_c is (5-1)^2=16 added to [1..3]. So for Y=3 (third element, which is the original A_3), the contribution is 1 *3² +8*3 +16 =9+24+16=49. The initial A_3 is 3. 3 +49=52, which matches the sample.Wait, but in the first query, the a_tree adds 1 to positions 1-3. So for Y=3 (original index 3), the sum_a is 1. So the a contribution is 1 *3²=9. Sum_b is 2*(5-1)=8 added to [1-3], so sum_b is 8, multiplied by Y=3 gives 24. Sum_c is (5-1)^2=16 added to [1-3], sum_c is 16. So 9+24+16=49, plus initial A_3 (3) gives 52.Yes. So the model works.Now, the code structure.We need to implement a Fenwick Tree (BIT) that can handle range updates and point queries. Each range update [L, R] adds delta to all elements from L to R. The point query returns the value at Y.In Python, implementing a Fenwick Tree for this purpose.The Fenwick Tree for range updates and point queries can be implemented as follows:class FenwickTree:    def __init__(self, size):        self.n = size        self.tree = [0] * (self.n + 2)  # 1-based indexing    def add(self, idx, delta):        # Adds delta to the position idx (1-based)        while idx &lt;= self.n:            self.tree[idx] += delta            idx += idx &amp; -idx    def query(self, idx):        # Returns the prefix sum up to idx (1-based)        res = 0        while idx &gt; 0:            res += self.tree[idx]            idx -= idx &amp; -idx        return res    def range_add(self, l, r, delta):        # Adds delta to the range [l, r] (1-based)        self.add(l, delta)        self.add(r + 1, -delta)So, for a range [l, r], we call range_add(l, r, delta), which adds delta to the positions from l to r.Wait, but the add() function is for point updates. So when you want to add delta to all elements from l to r, you do:self.add(l, delta)self.add(r+1, -delta)Then, when you compute the prefix sum up to idx, it gives the sum of all deltas applied to ranges that include idx.Wait, the prefix sum up to idx gives the value at idx. Because the add() function is applied in a way that when you accumulate the prefix sum, it&#39;s the same as the delta being added to all elements from l to the end. But when you subtract delta at r+1, the net effect is that elements from l to r have delta added, and elements from r+1 onwards have delta added and then subtracted (so no change).So, the Fenwick tree&#39;s query function returns the sum up to idx, which for each position i, gives the cumulative delta added to i.Thus, for each range [l, r], the call to range_add(l, r, delta) ensures that when you call query(i), it returns the sum of all deltas added to ranges that include i.Yes. So this Fenwick Tree implementation is suitable for our needs.Thus, in the code:- Read N and Q.- Read the initial array, which is 1-based in the problem. So in Python, we can store it as a list A, with A[0] being A_1, etc., but perhaps it&#39;s easier to read it into a list of size N, 0-based, and adjust the indices accordingly.Wait, for example, if the input is 5 elements: [1, 10, 3, 6, 5], then in Python, we can read them into a list called initial_A, where initial_A[0] is 1 (A_1), initial_A[1] is 10 (A_2), and so on.So when a query of type 2 Y comes, we need to get the initial_A[Y-1] (since Y is 1-based), plus the sum_a * Y^2 + sum_b * Y + sum_c.Yes.So the steps:Read N and Q.Read initial_A as a list of N integers (0-based).Initialize a_tree, b_tree, c_tree, each of size N.For each of the Q queries:   if the query is type 1:      L, R, X = ... (1-based)      compute delta_a = 1      a_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_a)      delta_b = 2 * (X - L)      b_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_b)      delta_c = (X - L)2      c_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_c)   else:      Y = ... (1-based)      sum_a = a_tree.query(Y)      sum_b = b_tree.query(Y)      sum_c = c_tree.query(Y)      res = initial_A[Y-1] + sum_a * Y2 + sum_b * Y + sum_c      print(res)This should work.Now, let&#39;s test this against the sample input.Sample Input 1:5 41 10 3 6 51 1 3 5 --&gt; type 1, L=1, R=3, X=5.So delta_a is 1, added to [1,3].delta_b is 2*(5 -1) = 8, added to [1,3].delta_c is (5-1)^2=16, added to [1,3].Then, query 2 3 --&gt; Y=3.sum_a is a_tree.query(3) which is 1 (since 3 is in [1,3]).sum_b is 8.sum_c is 16.Y=3.sum_a * Y² = 1 *9 =9, sum_b *3=24, sum_c=16. Total 9+24+16=49. initial_A[Y-1] is initial_A[2] which is 3. 3+49=52. Correct.Then, third query is 1 4 5 7. Type 1, L=4, R=5, X=7.delta_a =1 added to [4,5].delta_b = 2*(7-4) = 6. So added to [4,5].delta_c = (7-4)^2=9. added to [4,5].Then, query 2 5: Y=5.sum_a is a_tree.query(5). The first query added to [1,3], so a_tree&#39;s value at 5 is 0 (since 5 is outside 1-3). The third query added to [4,5], so delta_a is 1 added to 4 and 5. So sum_a at 5 is 1 (since 4 and 5 are in the range, but the query is the prefix sum up to 5. Wait, the Fenwick tree&#39;s query(Y) returns the sum of all deltas added to ranges that include Y.For the third query (L=4, R=5), delta_a is 1 added to [4,5]. So when Y=5, the a_tree.query(5) is 1 (from the third query&#39;s range addition). So sum_a is 1.sum_b is the sum of delta_b&#39;s for ranges that include 5. The first query&#39;s delta_b is 8, but 5 is outside 1-3, so sum_b is 0 for that. The third query&#39;s delta_b is 6, added to 4-5. So sum_b at 5 is 6.sum_c is the sum of delta_c&#39;s for ranges that include 5. First query: 16, but 5 is outside, so no. Third query&#39;s delta_c is 9, added to 4-5, so sum_c is 9.So sum_a * Y² =1 *25=25. sum_b * Y=6*5=30. sum_c=9. Total 25+30+9=64. initial_A[4] is 5. 5+64=69. Correct.Thus, the code works for the sample.Now, considering the constraints. N and Q are up to 1e5. Each query for type 1 requires three range_add operations (each O(2 log N)). Each type 2 query requires three query operations (each O(log N)). So for Q=1e5, each query is O(log N), which is acceptable.The Fenwick Tree implementation in Python can handle this. However, in Python, with 1e5 elements and 3 trees, each with O(1e5) nodes, the memory is manageable.Potential issues:- Overflow? But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.- Handling 1-based vs 0-based indices correctly.Another test case: let&#39;s take the first query in the sample. For Y=1:sum_a is 1 (since 1 is in [1,3]).sum_b is 8.sum_c is16.Y=1. sum_a *1 + sum_b *1 + sum_c = 1 +8 +16=25. initial_A[0] is 1. 1+25=26. Which matches the explanation.Yes.So the code should work. Now, implement it in Python.But how to read the input? The input may be large, so reading via sys.stdin with readline is better.But for Python, sometimes using sys.stdin.readline is faster. So the code should read all the data efficiently.So the code steps:Read N and Q from the first line.Read the initial array as a list of integers.Initialize three Fenwick trees of size N.For each of Q queries:   Read the query. Split into parts.   If the first part is 1:      L, R, X = parts[1], parts[2], parts[3]      Convert to integers.      Then, call a_tree.range_add(L, R, 1)      delta_b = 2*(X - L)      b_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_b)      delta_c = (X - L)2      c_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_c)   else:      Y = int(parts[1])      sum_a = a_tree.query(Y)      sum_b = b_tree.query(Y)      sum_c = c_tree.query(Y)      res = initial_A[Y-1] + sum_a * Y2 + sum_b * Y + sum_c      print(res)Implement the FenwickTree class as above.Now, code:class FenwickTree:    def __init__(self, size):        self.n = size        self.tree = [0] * (self.n + 2)  # 1-based    def add(self, idx, delta):        while idx &lt;= self.n:            self.tree[idx] += delta            idx += idx &amp; -idx    def query(self, idx):        res = 0        while idx &gt; 0:            res += self.tree[idx]            idx -= idx &amp; -idx        return res    def range_add(self, l, r, delta):        self.add(l, delta)        self.add(r + 1, -delta)def main():    import sys    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    ptr = 0    N, Q = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])    ptr +=2    initial_A = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+N]))    ptr +=N    a_tree = FenwickTree(N)    b_tree = FenwickTree(N)    c_tree = FenwickTree(N)    for _ in range(Q):        parts = input[ptr:ptr+4]  # but query type 2 has only 2 parts        if parts[0] == &#39;1&#39;:            L = int(parts[1])            R = int(parts[2])            X = int(parts[3])            ptr +=4            # Update a_tree            a_tree.range_add(L, R, 1)            # Update b_tree            delta_b = 2 * (X - L)            b_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_b)            # Update c_tree            delta_c = (X - L)2            c_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_c)        else:            Y = int(parts[1])            ptr +=2            sum_a = a_tree.query(Y)            sum_b = b_tree.query(Y)            sum_c = c_tree.query(Y)            res = initial_A[Y-1] + sum_a * Y * Y + sum_b * Y + sum_c            print(res)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()Wait, but in the &#39;else&#39; part (query type 2), the input line is split into parts. The type is parts[0], which is &#39;2&#39;, and then parts[1] is Y. But in the code above, when reading parts, the input is read as input[ptr:ptr+4], but for type 2 queries, the line has only two elements, so parts would have parts[0]=&#39;2&#39;, parts[1]=Y, and parts[2:] would be undefined. So in this code, when the query is type 2, the code reads parts as input[ptr:ptr+4], but that would include elements from the next line. Which is incorrect.So this is a problem. The code needs to read the correct number of elements for each query.So the way to handle this is to read each line as a separate entry. So perhaps read all input at once, and process each query line by line.But using sys.stdin.read().split() gives a list of all tokens. But for each query, the number of tokens depends on the type. For example, a type 1 query has 4 tokens (1, L, R, X), and a type 2 query has 2 tokens (2, Y).So the code can process the tokens sequentially. For example:- ptr starts at 0.- For each query:   Read the first token. If it is 1, then read the next three tokens (L, R, X). ptr increases by 4.   Else, read the next token (Y). ptr increases by 2.So the code in the loop should be:for _ in range(Q):    # Read the query type    t = input[ptr]    if t == &#39;1&#39;:        L = int(input[ptr+1])        R = int(input[ptr+2])        X = int(input[ptr+3])        ptr +=4        ... process ...    else:        Y = int(input[ptr+1])        ptr +=2        ... process ...Yes. So this would correctly handle the tokens.Thus, the code should be adjusted to read the query type first, then read the appropriate number of parameters.So the code in the loop:for _ in range(Q):    t = input[ptr]    if t == &#39;1&#39;:        L = int(input[ptr+1])        R = int(input[ptr+2])        X = int(input[ptr+3])        ptr +=4        # process type 1    else:        Y = int(input[ptr+1])        ptr +=2        # process type 2This way, for each query, the code reads the correct number of tokens.So the corrected code would be:...def main():    import sys    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    ptr = 0    N, Q = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])    ptr +=2    initial_A = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+N]))    ptr +=N    a_tree = FenwickTree(N)    b_tree = FenwickTree(N)    c_tree = FenwickTree(N)    for _ in range(Q):        # Determine query type        t = input[ptr]        if t == &#39;1&#39;:            L = int(input[ptr+1])            R = int(input[ptr+2])            X = int(input[ptr+3])            ptr +=4            a_tree.range_add(L, R, 1)            delta_b = 2 * (X - L)            b_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_b)            delta_c = (X - L)2            c_tree.range_add(L, R, delta_c)        else:            Y = int(input[ptr+1])            ptr +=2            sum_a = a_tree.query(Y)            sum_b = b_tree.query(Y)            sum_c = c_tree.query(Y)            res = initial_A[Y-1] + sum_a * Y * Y + sum_b * Y + sum_c            print(res)...This should handle the input correctly.Now, let&#39;s test this code with the sample input.Sample input:5 41 10 3 6 51 1 3 52 31 4 5 72 5The input list after reading is:[&#39;5&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;10&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;5&#39;]ptr starts at 0.N=5, Q=4. ptr becomes 2.initial_A is [1,10,3,6,5]. ptr becomes 7.Q=4 queries:First query: input[7] is &#39;1&#39; → type 1.L=1, R=3, X=5. ptr becomes 7+4=11.Second query: input[11] is &#39;2&#39; → type 2. Y=3. ptr becomes 11+2=13.Third query: input[13] is &#39;1&#39; → type 1. L=4, R=5, X=7. ptr becomes 13+4=17.Fourth query: input[17] is &#39;2&#39; → type 2. Y=5. ptr becomes 17+2=19.Which is correct.Thus, the code should handle this correctly.Another edge case: when L=R, like adding to a single position.But the code should handle it the same way.Therefore, the code should be correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle two types of queries on an array: range updates with a quadratic function and point queries to retrieve the current value of an element. Given the constraints, a direct approach would be too slow, so we use Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees) to manage the updates and queries efficiently. Approach1. Problem Analysis:   - The first type of query adds a quadratic expression to a range of elements.   - The second type of query retrieves the current value of a specific element.2. Key Insight:   - The quadratic expression can be decomposed into three separate coefficients (for (i^2), (i), and the constant term). This allows us to handle each coefficient with a separate Fenwick Tree.3. Efficient Range Updates:   - Each range update affects three coefficients. Using Fenwick Trees, we can perform these range updates in (O(log N)) time.4. Point Queries:   - For each point query, we compute the sum of contributions from all previous range updates using the three Fenwick Trees, then combine these with the initial value of the element.

Each component is added to the respective Fenwick Tree over the specified range.- Point Queries: For each point query, the current values of the coefficients are retrieved from the Fenwick Trees and combined with the initial value of the element to compute the result.This approach ensures that both range updates and point queries are handled efficiently in (O(log N)) time, making it suitable for large input sizes.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-cebbdad3 data-v-2e624778><div class="review" data-v-2e624778><div class="review-title" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>❓:</span>Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire is developing a transconduit tunnel network connecting all it’s planets.

Hmm, right. This sounds like a minimum spanning tree (MST) problem. The MST connects all nodes with the smallest possible total edge cost. So the problem reduces to finding the MST of the graph where each edge has the cost as defined.But wait, the problem is that with N up to 1e5, building all possible edges (which would be O(N^2)) is impossible. So I need a way to compute the MST without considering all possible edges. Because if I have to generate all possible pairs, that&#39;s way too slow. So there&#39;s a smarter approach here.Let me think. The cost between two nodes is the minimum of the three axis differences. How can I model this? Maybe the key is that the minimal edge between two nodes depends on the minimal of the three dimensions. So perhaps the MST can be found by considering the edges sorted along each axis, and then combining those edges in some way.Wait, in Krusky&#39;s algorithm, the MST is built by adding the edges in order of increasing cost. So perhaps the edges that contribute to the MST are the ones that are the smallest possible for each node in each dimension. Alternatively, maybe the MST can be constructed by considering the edges sorted along each axis and then merging the minimal edges from each axis.I remember that for problems where the edge cost is the Manhattan distance, sometimes you can sort the points along each axis and consider the adjacent points. But here the cost is the minimum of x, y, or z difference. So maybe each edge in the MST can be found by taking the minimal possible edges in each of the three sorted orders.Wait, for example: if I sort the points based on their x-coordinate, then for each consecutive pair in this sorted list, the x difference is the minimal possible for those two points. Then, for each such pair, the cost would be x_diff. But since the cost is the minimum of x, y, or z, perhaps the minimal edge between these two points is the x_diff. But maybe in other pairs, the minimal could be the y or z difference. So perhaps the MST can be built by considering the sorted edges along each axis, and then combining all those possible edges and using Krusky&#39;s algorithm to pick the necessary edges.But how to handle that? Because for each axis, if we sort the points along that axis and consider the adjacent pairs, those would give the minimal possible differences along that axis. Then, for each such pair, the edge cost is the difference along that axis. So, perhaps the MST can be constructed by considering all these edges (for x, y, z sorted lists) and then finding the MST using Krusky&#39;s algorithm.But wait, the cost for each pair is the minimum of x, y, z differences. So even if we sort along x, the actual cost of the edge between two consecutive x-sorted points is the minimal of their x difference, y difference, z difference. But in the sorted x list, their x difference is the smallest possible for that pair, but their y or z difference could be smaller than the x difference. Wait no. For example, consider two points sorted by x. The x difference between them is small, but their y difference is even smaller. Then the cost would be the y difference, which is smaller than the x difference. So when we generate edges from the sorted x list, the cost is not necessarily the x difference. That complicates things.Hmm, so maybe the approach of sorting each axis and considering adjacent pairs is not directly applicable here. Because even if you sort along x, the actual cost between the two points could be even smaller (like from another axis). So perhaps this approach would miss some edges.Wait, but how else can I generate all possible edges with their cost? Since there are O(N^2) edges, it&#39;s impossible. So there must be a way to find a subset of edges that is manageable in size (like O(N) per axis, so O(3N) edges) which can be used to compute the MST.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal spanning tree can be formed by considering for each point the closest points along each axis. Then, for each point, the edges to those closest points would be candidates for the MST.Wait, let&#39;s think of the problem in terms of Krusky&#39;s algorithm. For Krusky, we process edges in order of increasing cost, adding them if they connect two disjoint sets. The key is that the edges considered must include all edges that could be part of the MST. If we can generate a set of edges that includes all possible edges that could be in the MST, then we can apply Krusky&#39;s algorithm normally.So the question is: What&#39;s the minimal set of edges that must include all possible edges that could be part of the MST?If we can find such a set, then even if it&#39;s O(N) per axis, like 3*N edges, then Krusky&#39;s algorithm can process those edges and find the MST.But how to determine that?Wait, for the edge cost being the minimum of the three differences, perhaps the minimal edges for each node are along the axis where that node&#39;s coordinates are closest to another node. But how to model that.Alternatively, perhaps the MST can be formed by considering the edges generated by the following approach: For each axis (x, y, z), sort the points along that axis. Then, for each consecutive pair in the sorted list, add an edge between them with cost equal to the minimal of the three differences. Then, collect all such edges (from all three axes), and run Krusky&#39;s algorithm on this set of edges.But wait, would this capture all possible edges that could be part of the MST?Let me think of a scenario. Suppose there are two points where their minimal difference is in the y-axis, but they are not consecutive in the sorted y list. Then their edge would not be included in the sorted list. So that edge would be missed, leading to possibly an incorrect MST.Wait, for example, consider three points sorted by y-coordinate as A, B, C. Suppose the minimal difference between A and C is in y (since they are sorted, the difference is (C.y - A.y) which is bigger than B.y - A.y and C.y - B.y). But maybe for some reason, the minimal cost between A and C is in x, which is even smaller. But in this case, the edge between A and C would have a cost of x difference. However, in the sorted x list, if A and C are not consecutive, then their edge would not be added. So this approach would miss that edge.So that approach might not capture all necessary edges.Hmm. So that approach would not work. So what&#39;s the alternative?Alternatively, perhaps the MST can be built by considering all possible edges between pairs of points where the minimal cost is either the x, y, or z difference. But how to find those edges efficiently.Wait, here&#39;s another angle. For each point, the edges that could be part of the MST must have a cost that is the minimal possible. So for each point, maybe it&#39;s sufficient to connect it to its nearest neighbors in each of the three axes. For example, for each point, sort the points along x, and connect to the previous and next in the x-sorted list. Similarly for y and z. Then, collect all these edges (O(N) per axis, total 3*N edges) and run Krusky&#39;s on those.The idea here is that the MST must connect points through the minimal possible edges. So even if a pair of points are not adjacent in any axis, their minimal edge is considered if they are adjacent in one of the sorted lists. But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, this approach is similar to how some problems (like when edge cost is Manhattan distance) can be solved by considering edges sorted along each axis. For Manhattan, the minimal spanning tree can be built by considering edges along each axis sorted and taking the adjacent edges. But in that case, each edge&#39;s cost is the sum of the axis differences, which is different from here.But perhaps for this problem, the MST can be formed by considering the edges generated from the sorted x, y, and z coordinates. Because the minimal edge between any two points may be captured in one of these sorted orders.Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose we have three points A, B, C sorted along x-axis. The minimal edge between A and C could be the x difference (since they are sorted), but maybe in the y or z direction, their difference is smaller. But in that case, perhaps the edge between A and C is not part of the MST, but instead, edges through B would be cheaper.Alternatively, perhaps the MST is formed by the union of the MSTs generated for each axis. But that&#39;s not necessarily the case.Hmm. Let&#39;s think of the sample input 2:3 planets with coordinates:-1 -1 -15 5 510 10 10The minimal cost between the first and second is min(6,6,6) =6. Between second and third, min(5,5,5)=5. Between first and third: min(11,11,11)=11.So the MST would connect first to second (cost 6), second to third (cost 5), total 11. Which matches the sample output.In this case, the edges are consecutive in the sorted x, y, and z lists. So the approach of considering adjacent edges in each sorted list would capture these edges.Another example: sample input 1 has two points, so the only edge is between them. The minimal of the differences is 6 (x:7-1=6), y:3, z:8. So the cost is 3, which is the y difference. So if the points are sorted in x, then the x difference is 6, but the actual minimal is 3. So in the sorted x list, the edge is considered, but its cost is the minimal of x, y, z differences (which is 3). So when generating edges from the x-sorted list, the cost of the edge is correctly computed as 3, even though the x difference is 6.Wait, no. The sorted x list for sample input 1 would have the two points in order. The x difference is 6, y is 3, z is 8. So the cost is min(6,3,8) =3. So when generating the edge from the sorted x list, the cost would be 3, which is correct.So in this case, even though the x difference is not the minimal, the edge is still considered with the correct cost. But how? Because when we generate edges from the sorted x list, the edge between these two points is included. But the cost is computed as the minimal of the three differences, which is 3. So even though we generate the edge from the x-sorted list, the cost is correctly computed. So the approach of generating edges for each axis&#39;s sorted list (adjacent pairs) and then taking all those edges and processing them in order of their cost (using Krusky&#39;s) would work.But wait, let&#39;s think about a case where a pair of points are not adjacent in any sorted list but their minimal edge is lower than all edges in the sorted lists.For example, consider four points:A: (0, 0, 0)B: (1, 100, 100)C: (2, 100, 100)D: (3, 0, 0)If sorted along x-axis, the order is A, B, C, D.The adjacent edges in x would be A-B (x diff 1), B-C (1), C-D (1). The cost for these edges would be min(1, 100, 100) =1 each. But the minimal edge between A and D is min(3, 0,0) =0. Wait, but the x difference is 3, y difference is 0, z difference is 0. So the minimal is 0. So the edge between A and D has a cost of 0, which is the minimal possible. But in the sorted x list, A and D are not consecutive. So the edges considered between them would not be generated unless we generate all possible pairs. But in this case, the edge between A and D would have a cost of 0, which is the absolute minimal and would be part of the MST. But according to the approach of taking adjacent pairs in sorted lists, this edge would not be considered. Hence, the MST would not be found correctly.So this approach would fail in such a scenario.Hmm, so the problem with this approach is that non-consecutive pairs in any sorted list could have a minimal edge that&#39;s part of the MST. Thus, the approach of only considering adjacent pairs in the sorted lists would miss these edges, leading to a higher total cost.But how else can we find these edges without considering all possible pairs?This is a problem. Because in the example above, the edge between A and D has a cost of 0 (since their y and z differences are zero), which is the minimal possible. But they are not adjacent in any sorted list (assuming their x coordinates are 0,1,2,3). So the approach would miss this edge, and the MST would instead connect them through B and C, adding edges with cost 1 each, leading to a higher total cost. So the approach would fail.So this indicates that the approach of considering only adjacent pairs in the sorted lists is insufficient.But then how else can we find all the necessary edges for the MST without considering O(N^2) possibilities?Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a way to model this problem as a graph where each node is connected to its neighbors in all three sorted axes, but not just the immediate ones. But that would again lead to O(N) edges per axis, which for N=1e5 is manageable.Wait, perhaps for each axis, we can sort the points, and then for each point, connect it to its immediate previous and next in the sorted list. So for each axis, each point (except the first and last) contributes two edges. This would result in 3*(2N-2) edges, which is O(N). Then, Krusky&#39;s algorithm can process these edges, which are O(N) in number.But in the previous example, the edge between A and D would not be considered. So the approach would fail.So this suggests that this approach is not sufficient. But maybe for the problem&#39;s constraints, such edge cases don&#39;t exist, but I don&#39;t think so. The problem allows for all possible coordinate values, so such cases are possible.Hmm. So what&#39;s the correct approach here?Alternative idea: The minimal spanning tree can be found by considering all possible edges where the cost is the minimal of the three differences. So the edge cost is min(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|, |z1-z2|). This is equivalent to the minimal Manhattan distance between the two points along any of the three axes. So, the edge between two points is the minimal possible difference in any of the three dimensions.Wait, but how can we model this? Another approach: For each point, the minimal edge to another point is either along x, y, or z. So for each point, perhaps the minimal edges along each axis are the ones that could contribute to the MST. But even that isn&#39;t sufficient, as in the previous example where the minimal edge is not along any axis.Wait, no. In that example, the minimal edge between A and D is along y or z (both zero), so it&#39;s the minimal. So in that case, the edge is along another axis. But how would that be captured?Alternatively, perhaps the minimal edge between A and D is along the y or z axis. So perhaps if we sort the points along y and z axes as well, then A and D may be adjacent in one of those sorted lists.In the example above, for the y-axis:A&#39;s y is 0, D&#39;s y is 0. So when sorted by y, A and D are adjacent. So the edge between them would be considered in the y-sorted list. So their edge would be included in the edge list.Wait, in that case, the approach would work.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the example:Points A (0,0,0), B (1,100,100), C (2,100,100), D (3,0,0).When sorted by x: A (0), B (1), C (2), D (3). So edges A-B (x difference 1), B-C (1), C-D (1).When sorted by y: The y coordinates are 0 (A, D), 100 (B, C). So sorted order would be A, D (y=0), then B and C (y=100). So edges between A and D (y difference 0), D and B (100-0=100), B and C (0). So the edge A-D is included here. Similarly, for the z-axis, same as y.So in this scenario, the edge between A and D is considered in the y-sorted list. So when generating edges for the three sorted axes (including adjacent pairs), the edge A-D would be included. Then, Krusky&#39;s algorithm would process this edge first (cost 0), connecting A and D. Then, the rest would be processed. So the total cost would be 0 + 1 (B-C) + 1 (B or C connected to A-D via B or C). Wait, perhaps not. Let&#39;s see.The edges generated would include:From x-sorted: A-B (cost min(1, 100, 100) =1), B-C (cost 1), C-D (cost 1, 0 (y and z differences are 0? Wait, C&#39;s y is 100, D&#39;s y is 0. So the y difference is 100, z difference is 0. So the cost is min(1, 100, 0) =0. So the edge C-D has cost 0.From y-sorted: A-D (cost min(3 (x), 0 (y), 0 (z)) =0), D-B (x difference 2, y 100-0=100, z 100-0=100 → cost 2), B-C (x difference 1, y 0 → cost 0). Wait, B&#39;s y is 100, C&#39;s y is 100. So their y difference is 0. So the edge B-C in the y-sorted list would have cost min(1, 0, 0) → 0.So edges generated would include:A-B (cost 1), B-C (cost 1), C-D (cost 0), A-D (cost 0), D-B (cost 2), B-C (cost 0).So when we collect all these edges, the sorted list of edges would be:0 (A-D), 0 (C-D), 0 (B-C), 1 (A-B), 1 (B-C), 2 (D-B), etc.So Krusky&#39;s algorithm would process these edges in order. The first edge is A-D (cost 0), connecting them. Next is C-D (cost 0). Then B-C (cost 0). Then all four points are connected. So the total cost is 0+0+0=0. But the MST requires 3 edges for 4 nodes. So in this case, the approach works.Wait, but in this example, the minimal spanning tree would indeed have a total cost of 0. Because we can connect all points with edges of cost 0.But in reality, the edge between C and D in the x-sorted list (cost 1) has a cost that is the minimal of x difference (1), y difference (100-0=100), z difference (0). So the cost is min(1, 100, 0) → 0. So the edge C-D (from x-sorted list) has cost 0. So when generating edges from all sorted lists, the edge between C and D is included (from x-sorted list) with cost 0. But also, the edge B-C in the y-sorted list has cost 0 (since their y difference is 0). So in this case, the approach would capture all the necessary edges.So the approach of considering adjacent pairs in each sorted axis list would generate all edges with cost 0. So the minimal spanning tree can be formed.So in this case, the approach works. So the key is that even if two points are not adjacent in one axis&#39;s sorted list, they may be adjacent in another axis&#39;s sorted list, leading to their edge being considered.Therefore, the approach of generating edges from the three sorted lists (each sorted by x, y, z) and considering adjacent pairs in each list would generate all necessary edges to form the MST.Thus, the plan is:1. For each of the three axes (x, y, z), sort the points by that axis&#39;s coordinate.2. For each sorted list, generate edges between consecutive points. The cost of each edge is the minimal of the three coordinate differences between the two points.3. Collect all these edges (O(N) edges per axis, total 3*N edges).4. Sort all edges by their cost.5. Use Krusky&#39;s algorithm with a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to select edges in order of increasing cost, adding them to the MST if they connect two previously disconnected components.6. The sum of the costs of the selected edges is the answer.This approach should work because all edges that could be part of the MST are captured in the generated edge list. Even if two points are not adjacent in one axis&#39;s sorted list, they may be adjacent in another axis&#39;s sorted list, and their edge would have the minimal cost, thus being included in the edge list.Now, the next step is to implement this approach. Let&#39;s think about the steps.First, read the input: N points, each with x, y, z coordinates.Then, for each axis (x, y, z), we need to sort the points by that coordinate and generate edges between consecutive points.But how to represent the points? Each point has an index (from 0 to N-1), and for each axis, we sort the list of (coordinate, index) pairs. Then, for each consecutive pair in the sorted list, we create an edge between the two indices, with the cost computed as the minimal of the absolute differences in x, y, and z.Wait, but how to compute the minimal difference. For two points, after they are sorted along, say, x-axis, we can compute the differences in x, y, and z coordinates. The minimal of these three is the cost.So for each consecutive pair in the sorted list (after sorting by x, y, or z), we compute the three differences and take the minimal. That is the cost of the edge between those two points.So, for each axis, after sorting the points by that axis&#39;s coordinate, for each consecutive pair (i, j), compute cost as min( |xi - xj|, |yi - yj|, |zi - zj| ), and add this edge to the edge list.Once all edges are generated (3*(N-1) edges for each axis, so total 3*(N-1) edges), then we sort all edges by cost, and apply Krusky&#39;s algorithm.But wait, for N=1e5, 3*(N-1) edges is about 3e5 edges. Sorting them would be O(3e5 log 3e5) operations, which is manageable.Then, Krusky&#39;s algorithm with DSU would process these edges in order, which is O(3e5 α(N)) time, where α is the inverse Ackermann function. This should be acceptable.So the steps in code would be:Read N.If N is 0 or 1, output 0.Else:- Read all points, storing x, y, z and their indices.- For each of the three axes (x, y, z):   - Sort the points by the current axis&#39;s coordinate.   - For each consecutive pair in the sorted list:      - Compute dx = abs(x_i - x_j)      - dy = abs(y_i - y_j)      - dz = abs(z_i - z_j)      - cost = min(dx, dy, dz)      - Add this edge (cost, i, j) to the edge list.- Once all edges are collected, sort them by cost in ascending order.- Initialize DSU with N elements.- Initialize total_cost to 0.- Iterate over the sorted edges:   - For each edge (cost, u, v):      - If u and v are in different sets in DSU:          - Unite them.          - Add cost to total_cost.          - If all nodes are connected (number of connected components is 1), break early.- Output total_cost.Yes, that should work.Now, let&#39;s test this approach against the sample inputs.Sample Input 1:21 5 107 8 2The two points are sorted in x (1 vs 7), y (5 vs 8), z (2 vs 10).For x-sorted:edge cost is min(6, 3, 8) → 3.For y-sorted:points are sorted as 5 and 8. Edge cost is min(6, 3, 8) →3.For z-sorted: sorted as 2 and 10. Edge cost is min(6,3,8) →3.So edge list has three edges (each with cost 3). Krusky&#39;s algorithm will pick the first one (cost 3), but since there are two nodes, it&#39;s done. So the total cost is 3, which matches the sample.Sample Input 2:3-1 -1 -15 5 510 10 10After sorting each axis:For x-sorted, the order is -1, 5, 10.Edges:-1 and 5: x difference 6. y and z also 6. cost is 6.5 and 10: x difference 5, y 5, z 5. cost 5.For y-sorted: same as x-sorted. Edges are same.For z-sorted: same. Edges are same.Edge list contains:(5, 1-2), (6, 0-1), etc. Wait, let&#39;s see:The three points are indices 0,1,2.For x-sorted:edges 0-1 (cost min(6,6,6)=6), 1-2 (cost min(5,5,5)=5).Same for y and z sorted.So the edge list will have 3*2=6 edges:each of the two edges (0-1 and 1-2) from x, y, z sorted lists, but all have the same cost (6 and 5). So the sorted edges would be:5 (three times, from each sorted axis), 6 (three times).Krusky&#39;s algorithm will process the 5 edges first. It picks one 5 edge (connects 1 and 2). Then, the 6 edges: when processing 0-1, they are not connected. So add 6. Total cost 5+6=11. Which matches the sample.Thus, this approach works for the sample inputs.Now, let&#39;s think about the example I mentioned earlier with points A, B, C, D. Let&#39;s see how the code would handle it.Points:A: (0,0,0) → index 0B: (1,100,100) → index 1C: (2,100,100) → index 2D: (3,0,0) → index 3For each axis:x-sorted: 0,1,2,3.Edges:0-1: x diff 1. y diff 100, z diff 100 → cost 1.1-2: x 1. y 0, z 0 → cost 0 (min(1,0,0) is 0).2-3: x 1. y 100-0=100. z 100-0=100 → cost is 1.y-sorted:A (y=0), D (y=0), B (y=100), C (y=100).Edges:A-D: x 3-0=3, y 0-0=0, z 0-0=0 → cost 0.D-B: x 1-3=2, y 100-0=100, z 100-0=100 → cost 2.B-C: x 1, y 0 → cost 0.z-sorted:Same as y-sorted (since all points have same z as y).So edges from z-sorted are same as y-sorted.So the edge list will include:From x-sorted:(1, 0,1), (0,1,2), (1,2,3).From y-sorted:(0,0,3), (2,3,1), (0,1,2).From z-sorted:same as y.So all edges:Edge (0-1) cost 1.Edge (1-2) cost 0.Edge (2-3) cost 1.Edge (0-3) cost 0.Edge (3-1) cost 2.Edge (1-2) cost 0.Edge (0-3) cost 0.Edge (3-1) cost 2.Edge (1-2) cost 0.So when all edges are sorted, the edges with cost 0 come first. The order may vary but the first edges would be the 0-cost ones.Krusky&#39;s algorithm will process them in order. Let&#39;s see:First edge: 0-3 (cost 0). Add to MST. Now connected components: [0,3], 1,2.Next edge: 1-2 (cost 0). Add to MST. Components: [0,3], [1,2].Next edge: 1-2 (another occurrence). They are already connected. Skip.Next edge: 0-3 (another occurrence). Skip.Then edges with cost 0 between 1-2 again. All skipped.Then the next edge is 0-1 (cost 1). But 0 and 1 are in different components. Connect them. Now components: [0,3,1,2]. Total cost is 0 +0 +1 =1? Wait, no. Wait, the first two edges added are 0-3 (0) and 1-2 (0). Then, the next edges may be others.Wait, after processing 0-3 and 1-2, the components are [0,3], [1,2]. Then, any edge that connects these two components would be added next.For example, there&#39;s an edge between 3 and1 (cost 2) from the y-sorted list. But there&#39;s also edges between 2 and3 (cost 1, from x-sorted list).Wait, the edges in the list:After sorting, the order would be:0 (0-3), 0 (1-2), 0 (1-2), 0 (0-3), 0 (1-2), 0 (0-3), 1 (0-1), 1 (2-3), 2 (3-1), etc.Wait, but how exactly the edges are ordered when they have the same cost. For example, all edges with cost 0 come first, but their order may vary. However, Krusky&#39;s algorithm processes them in arbitrary order, but when two edges have the same cost, the order may affect which ones are chosen, but the total cost will be the same.But in our example, after adding two edges (0-3 and 1-2), the next edges that connect the two components would be any edge between the two components. For example, edge 1-3 (if present) or edge 2-3.Wait, in our example, there&#39;s an edge between 2 and 3 (from x-sorted list) with cost 1. Let&#39;s see:After adding 0-3 (cost 0) and 1-2 (cost 0), the components are [0,3] and [1,2]. Now, the edge between 2 and 3 has cost 1. This edge connects [0,3] and [1,2]. So adding this edge would cost 1, total 0+0+1=1. Which is better than the previous example&#39;s scenario.But in the original example, the edge between A and D (cost 0) connects them, and then B and C (cost 0) connects them. Then, any edge connecting the two components. The minimal such edge would be the edge between C and D (cost 0?), but according to the example, what&#39;s the cost between C and D?Wait, the edge between C and D (indexes 2 and 3) has:x difference: 3-2=1.y difference: 0-100=100.z difference: 0-100=100.So the cost is min(1,100,100) →1. So in the edge list, the edge between C and D (indexes 2-3) is generated from x-sorted list, with cost 1.But in the edge list, there is also an edge between 3 and1 (from y-sorted list) with cost 2. So the minimal edge connecting the two components is the one between 2 and3 (cost 1).So adding this edge would cost 1, leading to total cost 0+0+1=1. Which is correct.So the approach works in this case.Thus, the approach of generating edges from adjacent pairs in sorted lists for each axis is sufficient to capture all necessary edges for the MST.Thus, the code can be written as follows:Read the points, generate the edges from sorted lists, then Krusky&#39;s.Now, the code.But first, note that N can be up to 1e5. So the code needs to be efficient.Implementing DSU with path compression and union by rank is crucial.Also, the points need to be stored with their indices, so that when sorted by x, y, or z, we can track their original indices.So, steps in code:Read N.If N &lt;=1: print 0.Else:points = list of tuples (x, y, z, index) for each input line.For each axis in [0,1,2] (0=x, 1=y, 2=z):   sort the points by the axis&#39;s coordinate.   for i in 0 to N-2:      a = points[i]      b = points[i+1]      dx = abs(a[0] - b[0])      dy = abs(a[1] - b[1])      dz = abs(a[2] - b[2])      cost = min(dx, dy, dz)      add edge (cost, a[3], b[3]) to edges.Sort edges by cost.Initialize DSU.total =0count =0for edge in sorted edges:   cost, u, v = edge   if find(u) != find(v):      union(u, v)      total += cost      count +=1      if count == N-1: breakprint(total)This should work.Now, test case 1:Sample Input 1:21 5 107 8 2points are (x,y,z,index) → [(1,5,10,0), (7,8,2,1)]sorted by x: same order.edge between them:dx=6, dy=3, dz=8 → cost 3.sorted by y: 5 and 8 → edge with cost 3.sorted by z: 10 and 2 → edge with cost 8 (since dz is 8, but min is 3 (same as before? Wait, no. Wait, when sorted by z, the order is 2, 10. So the two points are (7,8,2) and (1,5,10). So dx=6, dy=3, dz=8. cost is min(6,3,8)=3.So all three edges have cost 3. So the edge list has three edges of cost 3. When sorted, they are all same. Krusky&#39;s picks the first, connects them. Total cost 3.Sample Input 2:3-1 -1 -1 → index 05 5 5 → index 110 10 10 → index 2sorted by x: 0,1,2.edges between 0-1: dx 6, dy 6, dz 6 → cost 6.1-2: dx5, dy5, dz5 → cost5.Same for y and z sorted. So edges are:0-1 (6), 1-2 (5) for each axis → three times each.So edge list has 0-1 (6) three times, and 1-2 (5) three times.sorted edges: five entries come first (three 5&#39;s, then three 6&#39;s).Krusky&#39;s will pick one 5 edge (connects 1-2), then one 6 edge (connects 0-1). Total 5+6=11.Thus, the code works.Now, implement this in Python.But for N=1e5, the code must be efficient. However, in Python, sorting 3*(1e5) edges is manageable. Also, the DSU with path compression and union by rank is manageable.But note that in Python, for 1e5 elements, the DSU is manageable.Now, code:Read N.If N is 0 or 1: print 0.Else:read N points, storing x, y, z, and their indices (0-based).generate edges.Then sort edges.Then Krusky&#39;s.Implement DSU as a class.Sample code:class DSU:    def __init__(self, size):        self.parent = list(range(size))        self.rank = [0]*size    def find(self, x):        if self.parent[x] != x:            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])        return self.parent[x]    def union(self, x, y):        xroot = self.find(x)        yroot = self.find(y)        if xroot == yroot:            return False        if self.rank[xroot] &lt; self.rank[yroot]:            self.parent[xroot] = yroot        else:            self.parent[yroot] = xroot            if self.rank[xroot] == self.rank[yroot]:                self.rank[xroot] +=1        return TrueThen, in the code:n = int(input())if n &lt;=1:    print(0)    exit()points = []for i in range(n):    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())    points.append( (x, y, z, i) )edges = []# generate edges for each axisfor axis in range(3):    # sort by axis    points_sorted = sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[axis])    for i in range(len(points_sorted)-1):        a = points_sorted[i]        b = points_sorted[i+1]        dx = abs(a[0] - b[0])        dy = abs(a[1] - b[1])        dz = abs(a[2] - b[2])        cost = min(dx, dy, dz)        edges.append( (cost, a[3], b[3]) )# sort edges by costedges.sort()dsu = DSU(n)total = 0count =0for edge in edges:    cost, u, v = edge    if dsu.find(u) != dsu.find(v):        dsu.union(u, v)        total += cost        count +=1        if count == n-1:            breakprint(total)This should work.Testing this code with the examples:Sample Input 1:21 5 107 8 2edges for x:cost 3.edges for y: same.edges for z: same.Total three edges. After sorting, all are cost 3. Krusky&#39;s picks one. Output is 3.Sample Input 2:3-1 -1 -15 5 510 10 10edges for x:0-1 (6), 1-2 (5).Same for y and z. So edges list has 3*2=6 edges: three copies of 0-1 (6), three copies of 1-2 (5). Sorted edges: 5,5,5,6,6,6. Krusky&#39;s adds two edges: 5 and 6. Total 11.Thus, the code works.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost to connect all planets in a 3D space using transconduit tunnels. The cost between two planets is defined as the minimum of the absolute differences in their x, y, or z coordinates. This problem can be efficiently solved using a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) approach with Kruskal&#39;s algorithm, optimized by considering only necessary edges. Approach1. Problem Analysis: The cost of connecting two planets is the minimum of the differences in their x, y, or z coordinates. This requires finding the MST where the edge weights are defined by this minimum difference.2. Key Insight: Instead of considering all possible edges (which is infeasible for large N), we can generate edges by sorting the planets along each axis (x, y, z). For each sorted list, we consider edges between consecutive planets. This reduces the number of edges to O(N) per axis, making the problem manageable.3. Algorithm Selection: Kruskal&#39;s algorithm is used to find the MST. This algorithm processes edges in ascending order of their weights and uses a union-find data structure to efficiently manage connected components.4. Edge Generation: For each axis, after sorting the planets, generate edges between consecutive pairs. The cost of each edge is the minimum of the differences in x, y, and z coordinates.5. Complexity: Sorting the edges takes O(N log N) time per axis, and Kruskal&#39;s algorithm runs in O(E log E) time where E is the number of edges (3N for three axes). The union-find operations are nearly constant time due to path compression and union by rank.

Reading Input: The number of planets and their coordinates are read from the input.2. Edge Generation: For each axis (x, y, z), the planets are sorted, and edges between consecutive planets in each sorted list are generated. The cost of each edge is computed as the minimum of the differences in x, y, and z coordinates.3. Kruskal&#39;s Algorithm: The edges are sorted by their cost. Using a union-find data structure, edges are processed in ascending order to build the MST, ensuring that each edge connects two previously disconnected components.4. Output: The total cost of the MST is printed, which is the minimum cost to connect all planets using the transconduit tunnels.This approach efficiently reduces the problem size by considering only necessary edges, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-cebbdad3 data-v-2e624778><div class="review" data-v-2e624778><div class="review-title" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>❓:</span>Given an array arr[ ] of N positive integers, the task is to find the greatest element on the left of every element in the array which is strictly smaller than itself, if this element does not exist for an index print &quot;-1&quot;.Example 1:Input:N = 5arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 1}Output: -1 2 3 4 -1Explanation:Greatest element on the left of 3 smaller than itself is 2, for 4 it is 3 and for 5 it is 1.

I need to solve this problem where for each element in the array, I have to find the greatest element to its left that is strictly smaller than itself. If there&#39;s no such element, return -1. Hmm. So the first element will always have -1 since there&#39;s nothing to the left. For others, I have to look at all elements before it and find the maximum one that&#39;s smaller than the current. Wait, but the constraints say N can be up to 1e6. Oh right, so a naive approach where for each element I check all previous elements would be O(n^2), which is definitely going to be too slow. That&#39;s not going to work. So I need a more efficient method here.What&#39;s the expected time complexity? O(N log N). Oh right. So I need an approach that&#39;s linearithmic. Let me think about data structures that can help here. Maybe using a sorted structure to keep track of elements as we process them, and for each new element, find the largest element smaller than it in the sorted structure.Yes, that makes sense. So for each element in the array (starting from the second), we need to query the set of elements to the left (which we&#39;ve already processed) and find the maximum value less than the current element. Then, we can add the current element to this structure for future queries.But how do we efficiently find the largest element smaller than the current one? A sorted data structure that allows for binary search would be ideal here. Like, if we maintain a list that&#39;s kept sorted, then for each new element, we can perform a binary search to find the insertion point, and the element before that point would be the largest smaller element.Wait, but inserting into a sorted list each time is O(n) if we use a regular list. Because inserting in the middle would require shifting elements. That&#39;s O(n) time per insertion, leading to O(n^2) total time. Which is bad.So maybe a better data structure here is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) that allows for O(log n) insertion and O(log n) queries. But Python&#39;s standard libraries don&#39;t have such a structure. However, there is the &#39;bisect&#39; module which can help with binary search on a list. But again, inserting into a list is O(n) time. Hmm.Wait, but if we use a list and keep it sorted, using the bisect module&#39;s functions to find the insertion point. Then inserting into the list would take O(n) time each time, which for N=1e6 would be 1e12 operations. That&#39;s way too slow.So that approach won&#39;t work. So we need a better way. Oh, perhaps using a data structure that allows for O(log n) insertion and O(log n) maximum predecessor queries. What&#39;s available in Python?Alternatively, think of it this way: for each element, after processing all elements to the left, we need a way to quickly find the largest element smaller than current. So perhaps a TreeSet-like structure, which is sorted and allows for ceiling and floor operations. In Java, there&#39;s a TreeSet, but in Python, we don&#39;t have that built-in. So we need to find a way to simulate that.Wait, the bisect module can help here. Let&#39;s think. Let&#39;s maintain a sorted list. For each new element, we can use bisect_left to find the index where the element would be inserted. The elements before that index are all less than the current element. The largest among them would be the element at index pos-1. So if pos is 0, there are no elements smaller than current, so return -1. Otherwise, the element at pos-1 is the largest smaller. Then, insert the current element into the sorted list.But inserting into a list using bisect.insort is O(n) time, since it requires shifting elements. So for N=1e6, that&#39;s O(n^2) time. Which is not feasible.Hmm. So this approach is O(n^2) time. Which is way beyond the allowed time for the problem. So what&#39;s the alternative?We need a data structure that allows us to perform insertions and queries in O(log n) time. But in Python, the standard libraries don&#39;t provide a TreeSet or similar. So what can we do here?Wait, perhaps we can use a binary indexed tree (Fenwick Tree) or a segment tree. But how?Alternatively, think about the problem differently. Let&#39;s consider that we need to process elements from left to right, and for each element, track the maximum elements in a way that allows efficient querying.Wait, but the elements can be up to 1e8, so we can&#39;t index them directly. So a frequency array approach isn&#39;t feasible. Hmm.Another approach: perhaps we can use a balanced BST implementation. But implementing a self-balancing BST is complicated. However, maybe there&#39;s a way to use the &#39;bisect&#39; module in a clever way with some augmented data structures.Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved using a monotonic stack approach. Let&#39;s think. The problem is similar to the &#39;nearest greater to left&#39; type problems, but here we need the greatest element smaller than current. So for each element, we need the maximum element in the elements to the left that is less than current.A monotonic stack approach typically works for finding next greater or smaller elements. Let me think. For example, for each element, we can maintain a stack that helps us find the previous element that meets some condition.In this case, maybe we can use a stack that is maintained in a way that allows us to track the elements in a sorted order. Wait, but how?Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the stack as elements in decreasing order. For each new element, we pop elements from the stack that are less than the current element. Because if the current element is larger than those, they cannot be the maximum elements for future elements. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, for each element, the answer is the maximum element in the set of elements before it that is smaller than it. So the maximum in the left elements that are less than current.So, if we can keep track of all elements to the left in a structure that allows us to quickly query the maximum value less than current.This is exactly the problem that a Binary Search Tree (BST) can solve. For example, in Java&#39;s TreeSet, the floor() method returns the greatest element less than or equal to a given element. So, for each element, we can call floor(current - 1) to get the largest element strictly smaller than current.But in Python, we don&#39;t have a built-in TreeSet. So how to proceed?Wait, maybe there&#39;s a way to use a list and bisect module, but in a way that allows us to avoid O(n) insertions. For example, using a list that is maintained in a sorted order. Insertions are O(n) time, but if we can find a way to make that O(1) or O(log n), but in Python, list insertions are O(n) time because elements have to be shifted. So for 1e6 elements, that&#39;s 1e12 operations. Which is way too slow.So the problem is that the bisect approach&#39;s insertion is O(n) time. So for large N, it&#39;s not feasible.Hmm. So what&#39;s another way?Another idea: Since we need to track the maximum elements less than current, perhaps we can use a structure that tracks the maximum elements in certain ranges. For example, a segment tree that stores the maximum values in certain ranges, allowing for efficient queries.But building a segment tree for the possible range of values (1e8) is impossible. So we need to compress the values. Wait, but the elements can be up to 1e8, but their number is up to 1e6. So coordinate compression could be feasible.Let me think. First, collect all the elements and assign them compressed indices. Then build a segment tree based on these compressed indices. But since we are processing elements in order, and for each element, we need to query the maximum value in the set of elements that have been added so far and are less than current, this could work.Let&#39;s outline the steps:1. Collect all the elements and sort them to get unique values and assign each a compressed index. Let&#39;s say we create a list sorted_unique which is the sorted list of unique elements. For each element x in the array, its compressed index is the position in sorted_unique where x is found. This allows us to map elements to a compressed range.2. Then, as we process each element from left to right, for each element arr[i], we need to find the maximum value in the set of elements that have been processed before i and are less than arr[i]. This can be done by querying the segment tree for the maximum in the range [0, compressed_index_of(arr[i]-1)]. But wait, arr[i] may not be present in the sorted_unique list, so the actual maximum less than arr[i] would be the maximum in the compressed indices corresponding to elements less than arr[i].Wait, the sorted_unique list is sorted. So if we have arr[i], the elements less than arr[i] are those with compressed indices in the range [0, k-1], where k is the position found via bisect_left in the sorted_unique list for arr[i]. Then the maximum in that range can be found via the segment tree.But the problem is that the elements processed before i may not have been inserted into the segment tree yet. Wait, no. For each element, after querying, we insert it into the segment tree. So the segment tree keeps track of all elements processed so far. So when processing element i, the segment tree contains all elements from 0 to i-1.So the steps would be:For each element in the array:- Find the compressed index of the current element.- Query the segment tree for the maximum value in the compressed indices that are less than the current compressed index (but only if the elements in those indices are less than the current value). Wait, no. Because the compressed indices are sorted, the elements in the compressed indices less than the current element&#39;s compressed index are exactly the elements less than current element. Because sorted_unique is sorted. So if the current element&#39;s compressed index is k, then all elements with compressed index less than k are elements less than or equal to the current element. Wait, no. Because sorted_unique contains unique elements. So for example, if sorted_unique is [1,3,5], then the compressed index for 3 is 1. So elements with compressed index less than 1 are 1, which is less than 3. So, the maximum in the compressed indices less than k is the maximum element less than the current element.Wait, but how to handle when the current element is not present in the sorted_unique list? Because in the sorted_unique list, the elements are unique and sorted. So when we compress, each element is mapped to its position in the sorted list. So if the current element is not present in the sorted_unique list (since the list may have been built from all elements, but perhaps duplicates exist?), but wait, the problem says the array has N positive integers. So there can be duplicates. But during coordinate compression, we can have duplicates. Wait, for example, if the array is [2, 2, 3], then the sorted_unique list would be [2, 3]. So the compressed index for 2 is 0, and for 3 is 1.So when processing the second element (2), which has compressed index 0, we want to find elements less than 2. But in the compressed indices, elements less than 0 would be nothing. So the maximum would be -1, but in reality, the first element is 2 (same as current), which is not less than. So that approach is incorrect.Ah, right. Because the coordinate compression may group elements that are equal. So elements with the same value as current would be in the same compressed index. So this approach would not work for finding elements strictly smaller than current.So perhaps coordinate compression is not the right way here. Because even after compression, the elements in the segment tree would need to be compared based on their actual values, not the compressed indices.Hmm. So maybe the idea of using a segment tree isn&#39;t directly applicable here. Because the query is based on the actual value, not the position in the compressed list. So the problem with this approach is that the compressed indices may not correspond to the actual values&#39; order when there are duplicates.Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate compression can include all elements, even duplicates. But that would not help. For example, if the array has multiple instances of the same element, but we need to track them all. Then the coordinate compression would not collapse duplicates, but then the sorted list would have all elements, and the compressed index would be the position in that sorted list. But that would not help in any way.Alternatively, maybe use a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) that can track the maximum value. But Fenwick Trees are typically used for cumulative sums and are not straightforward for maximum queries. But perhaps there is a way to implement a Fenwick Tree for maximum queries.Wait, Fenwick Trees can be used for maximum queries if we structure them in a certain way. For example, each node in the Fenwick Tree can store the maximum value in a certain range. When updating, we propagate the maximum up the tree. Then, queries can be done in O(log n) time. But this approach would require that the elements are inserted in a certain order, and the keys are within a manageable range.So, combining coordinate compression with a Fenwick Tree (or a segment tree) that tracks the maximum in ranges. Let&#39;s outline the steps again:1. Collect all unique elements from the array and sort them. Assign each a compressed index. For example, if sorted_unique is [a, b, c, ...], then a&#39;s index is 1, b&#39;s index is 2, etc. (or zero-based). Let&#39;s say we use zero-based.2. For each element in the original array, compute its compressed index using the sorted_unique list. For example, for arr[i], use bisect_left to find the index in sorted_unique where arr[i] would be inserted. Since sorted_unique contains all unique elements, the index gives the compressed index.3. Now, the problem is to find, for each element, the maximum element in the elements processed so far (those to the left) that have a value strictly less than the current element. To do this, we can query the Fenwick Tree (or segment tree) for the maximum in the range of compressed indices that correspond to elements less than the current value.But here&#39;s the catch: elements less than the current value may have compressed indices less than some value. So for current element x, the elements less than x are those in the sorted_unique list that are before x. So the compressed indices for those elements are from 0 to k-1, where k is the index of x in the sorted_unique list.Wait, but x may not be present in the sorted_unique list. Wait, no. Because sorted_unique is built from all elements in the array. So x is in the array, but sorted_unique contains all unique elements. So x would be present in the array, but when building sorted_unique, we have to include all elements, not just unique ones? No, because the array can have duplicates. Wait, no. The array can have duplicates. For example, arr could be [2, 2, 3]. Then sorted_unique would be [2, 3]. The first element 2 is in the array, and when we process the second 2, we need to find elements less than 2, which there are none. So the answer would be -1 for that position. But according to the example, the first element&#39;s answer is -1, and the second element&#39;s answer would be 2 (since the previous element is 2, but that&#39;s not strictly smaller). So that&#39;s incorrect.Wait, the problem says &quot;strictly smaller than itself&quot;. So the elements to the left must be strictly smaller. So in the case of duplicates, like arr[i] is 2, and there are elements to the left that are 2, those are not considered. So the answer is the maximum element in the left that is less than 2.So the coordinate compression approach must take into account the actual values, including duplicates.Wait, but for the coordinate compression, how do we handle duplicates? For example, if the array is [2, 2, 3], then the sorted list is [2, 2, 3], sorted_unique (if taken as unique) is [2,3]. But when processing the second 2, we need to find elements to the left (the first 2) which are not smaller than it. So the answer would be -1.But if we use a Fenwick Tree that tracks the maximum, then for the first 2, the Fenwick Tree is empty. So the answer is -1. Then the Fenwick Tree is updated with 2. For the second 2, the query is for the maximum element less than 2, which is zero, so the answer is -1. Then update the Fenwick Tree again with 2. For the third element 3, the query is for elements less than 3. The Fenwick Tree contains 2 and 2. The maximum is 2. So answer is 2.So in this case, the Fenwick Tree approach would work. But how?Wait, the Fenwick Tree in this case must track the maximum value for each compressed index. The compressed indices must be based on the sorted list of all elements (including duplicates). But that&#39;s not feasible for large N (1e6), since sorting 1e6 elements would take O(n log n) time, which is acceptable. But coordinate compression for 1e6 elements would take O(n) time with sorting and deduplication.Wait, but in this case, we need to have the compressed index of each element based on the sorted list of all elements (not unique). Because when we process the elements, we need to know for each element x, how many elements are smaller than x. But if there are duplicates, their positions in the sorted list are contiguous.Wait, perhaps the approach is to first sort the array, then for each element in the original array, its compressed index is its position in the sorted array. Then, for each element x in the original array, the elements less than x are those with compressed indices less than the first occurrence of x in the sorted array.But that&#39;s not correct. For example, the sorted array could have multiple elements equal to x. So the first occurrence of x in the sorted array is the first element equal to x. So all elements before that are less than x. So the compressed index for x in the original array would be the index of x in the sorted array, which could be in the middle of a group of x&#39;s. So how to handle that.Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate compression should map each element to its rank in the sorted list of unique elements. For example, for the array [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], the sorted unique elements are [1, 2, 3, 4,5]. Then each element&#39;s compressed index is its rank (like 1 → 0, 2 →1, etc). Then, for a given element x, all elements with compressed index less than the compressed index of x are elements less than x. But this is only true if x is present in the sorted unique list. For example, if x is 2, then the compressed index is 1. All elements with compressed index less than 1 are 1, which is less than 2. So this works.But if the array contains duplicates, like [2,2,3], then sorted_unique is [2,3]. The compressed index for 2 is 0, for 3 is 1. So when processing the second 2, we look for elements with compressed index less than 0 (which is none), so answer is -1. Which is correct.Wait, but in this case, the first element is 2, which has compressed index 0. The second 2 also has compressed index 0. So when processing the second 2, the query would be for elements with compressed index less than 0 (since 0 is the compressed index of 2), which is none. So the answer is -1, which is correct.So this approach seems to handle duplicates correctly. Because even if the array has duplicates, the compressed index is based on the sorted unique elements. So for any element x, elements with a compressed index less than x&#39;s compressed index are strictly less than x. Because the sorted_unique list is sorted, and x&#39;s compressed index is the position in that list where x is found. So elements before that position are all less than x.So, in this case, for a given element x, the elements to the left (processed so far) that are strictly less than x are those elements with compressed indices less than the compressed index of x. So, the maximum element among those can be found by querying the Fenwick Tree for the maximum in the range [0, compressed_index(x) - 1].But how to handle this with a Fenwick Tree that tracks the maximum.So the steps would be:1. Collect all unique elements in the array, sort them to create sorted_unique.2. For each element x in the original array, compute its compressed index as the index in sorted_unique where x is found. This can be done with bisect_left.3. Initialize a Fenwick Tree (or segment tree) that can track the maximum value in a range.4. Iterate through each element in the array:   a. For the current element x, find its compressed index k.   b. Query the Fenwick Tree for the maximum value in the range [0, k-1]. If this range is invalid (k-1 &lt;0), then the answer is -1. Else, the answer is the maximum found.   c. Update the Fenwick Tree by inserting the value x at position k.Wait, but how does inserting x at position k work? Because the Fenwick Tree needs to track the maximum in each position. For example, if there are multiple elements with the same compressed index, how do we track the maximum among them. Wait, perhaps each position in the Fenwick Tree represents the maximum value for that compressed index. So when inserting a new element x with compressed index k, if x is larger than the current maximum stored at k, then update it. Otherwise, leave it as is.Wait, but if multiple elements have the same compressed index (like duplicates in the original array), then when inserting a new x (which is equal to others in the same compressed index), the Fenwick Tree needs to track the maximum value in that compressed index. So for example, if the Fenwick Tree at position k has a maximum value of 5, and we insert another 5 (same compressed index k), then the Fenwick Tree&#39;s position k should still track 5. If we insert a 6 which also has the same compressed index, then we need to check why. Wait, no, if sorted_unique contains the unique elements, then all elements with the same compressed index are equal. So in that case, the Fenwick Tree&#39;s position k can store the maximum value for that compressed index, which is the same as the element (since all elements with compressed index k are equal to sorted_unique[k]).Wait, no. For example, if sorted_unique is [2,3], and the array has elements [2,2,3]. The compressed indices for the first two elements are 0. The third is 1. So when inserting the first 2 into the Fenwick Tree at position 0, the Fenwick Tree will track the maximum in position 0 as 2. Inserting the second 2, which is also at position 0. Since the current maximum at 0 is already 2, which is equal to the new value, no update is needed. So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s position 0 remains 2.But then, when querying for the maximum in [0, k-1] (where k is 0, so k-1 is -1), the answer is -1, which is correct.Hmm. So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s nodes track the maximum value for each compressed index. So when inserting a value x with compressed index k, we check if x is greater than the current maximum stored at k. If yes, we update it to x. Otherwise, we leave it as is. Because for future queries, if there are multiple elements with the same compressed index, the maximum among them is the same as the element itself (since all have the same value). Wait, no. Because all elements with the same compressed index are equal to sorted_unique[k], which is the value for that compressed index. So when inserting elements, all elements in the same compressed index have the same value. Because sorted_unique is built from unique elements. So for example, if the array has two 2&#39;s, sorted_unique will have 2 once. So their compressed index is 0. So when inserting them into the Fenwick Tree, the value stored at position 0 is 2. So inserting multiple 2&#39;s doesn&#39;t change the maximum for that compressed index.So in this case, the Fenwick Tree can be implemented such that each position corresponds to a compressed index (from sorted_unique), and the value stored is the element&#39;s value (which is sorted_unique[k]). So whenever we insert an element, we set the position k to the maximum of the current value and the new value. But since all elements with compressed index k have the same value (sorted_unique[k]), inserting multiple elements with the same compressed index won&#39;t change the value stored. So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s position k can be initialized to -infinity, and then when inserting elements, we set it to the maximum between the current value and sorted_unique[k]. But since sorted_unique[k] is fixed, once it&#39;s set once, further inserts for the same k won&#39;t change it.So the steps are:- Preprocess the array to create sorted_unique, which is the sorted list of unique elements.- For each element x in the original array, find its compressed index k (using bisect_left on sorted_unique).- The Fenwick Tree&#39;s nodes represent the maximum value for each compressed index. Initially, all nodes are set to -infinity.- For each element in the array:   a. Get k.   b. Query the Fenwick Tree for the maximum in the range [0, k-1]. This gives the maximum element less than x.   c. If the maximum is -infinity, output -1. Otherwise, output the maximum.   d. Update the Fenwick Tree at position k to max(current value at k, sorted_unique[k]). But since sorted_unique[k] is x&#39;s value, and the Fenwick Tree&#39;s position k is initialized to -infinity, the first insertion will set it to x. Subsequent insertions for the same k will compare x with x, so no change.So this approach should work.Now, implementing the Fenwick Tree for maximum queries.The Fenwick Tree for maximum queries is similar to the sum-based Fenwick Tree, but each node stores the maximum value in its range. The update operation propagates upwards, replacing parent nodes if the new value is larger than the current maximum in their ranges.Here&#39;s how the Fenwick Tree for maximum can be implemented:- The tree is initialized with all values as -infinity.- To update a position i (1-based index), we set tree[i] to the maximum of its current value and the new value, then move up the tree to update all relevant parents.- To query the maximum from 1 to i, we traverse the tree downwards, collecting the maximum from the relevant ranges.But the problem is that our query is for the range [0, k-1] in compressed indices. But the Fenwick Tree is 1-based. So we need to adjust the indices.Wait, in the sorted_unique list, the compressed indices are 0-based. So when we convert to 1-based for the Fenwick Tree, we add 1. So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s indices will be from 1 to m, where m is the length of sorted_unique.So for a compressed index k (0-based), the Fenwick Tree&#39;s index is k+1.So when querying for [0, k-1] (0-based), it translates to [1, k] in 1-based indices (since k-1 in 0-based is k-1+1 =k in 1-based). Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:Original compressed indices (0-based): 0,1,2,...,m-1.Converted to Fenwick Tree indices (1-based): 1,2,3,...,m.So a query for [0, k-1] in 0-based is the same as [1, (k-1)+1] = [1, k] in Fenwick indices, if k-1 &gt;=0.Wait, for example, if k is 0 (0-based), then k-1 is -1. So the query [0, -1] is invalid. So the Fenwick Tree query is not needed, and the answer is -1.Otherwise, for k &gt;=1 in 0-based, the range is [0, k-1] in 0-based, which is [1, k-1 +1] = [1, k] in Fenwick indices. So the query is from 1 to k in Fenwick indices.The Fenwick Tree&#39;s query function will return the maximum in this range.So, the Fenwick Tree&#39;s query function returns the maximum in the range [1, i], where i is the Fenwick Tree&#39;s index.So for a given k in 0-based:if k ==0: the query range is [0, -1], which is invalid. So answer is -1.else: query the Fenwick Tree for [1, k] (since k-1 in 0-based is the same as k in Fenwick Tree).Wait, maybe I&#39;m getting confused here. Let&#39;s think with an example:Original sorted_unique list: [2,3,5]. So m=3.For an element x=3, compressed index k=1 (0-based). So elements less than x are those with compressed indices &lt;1, which is 0 (value 2). So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s query should look for the maximum in 0-based indices [0,0], which is [1,1] in 1-based indices. So the query range is from 1 to 1.But in our approach, when k=1 (0-based), the query is for [0, k-1] = [0,0]. So in Fenwick Tree terms, this is 1-based indices 1 to 1.So, the Fenwick Tree&#39;s query is from 1 to k (which is 1 in this case).Another example: x=5 has k=2. Elements less than 5 are those with k &lt;2, which are 0 and 1 (values 2 and 3). So the Fenwick Tree query should find the maximum in 1-based indices 1 and 2 (since 0-based 0 is 1-based 1, and 0-based 1 is 1-based 2). So the query range is 1 to 2.So the query is from 1 to (k-1+1) =k.Yes. So the general rule is: when the original query is for 0-based [0, k-1], the Fenwick Tree query is [1, k] in 1-based indices, where k is the original k.So for each element x with compressed index k (0-based):if k ==0:   no elements are less than x. Answer is -1.else:   query Fenwick Tree for the maximum in 1-based indices 1 to k.So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s query function is called with &#39;k&#39; (the 0-based compressed index).Now, implementing the Fenwick Tree for maximum queries.The Fenwick Tree (max version) can be implemented as follows:class FenwickTree:    def __init__(self, size):        self.n = size        self.tree = [-inf] * (self.n +1)  # 1-based indexing    def update(self, idx, value):        # idx is 1-based        while idx &lt;= self.n:            if value &gt; self.tree[idx]:                self.tree[idx] = value            else:                break  # no need to update further            idx += idx &amp; -idx    def query(self, idx):        # returns max from 1..idx        res = -inf        while idx &gt;0:            if self.tree[idx] &gt; res:                res = self.tree[idx]            idx -= idx &amp; -idx        return resWait, but the update method here may not work correctly. Because in the Fenwick Tree for maximum, when you update a position, you need to propagate up the tree, updating all the relevant nodes that cover the current index. For example, if you update index 3 (binary 11), then you also need to update index 4 (100), 8 (1000), etc. But in the code above, the loop adds the least significant bit each time. For example, if idx is 3 (binary 11), then next idx is 3 + 1 (since 3 &amp; -3 is 1) → 4. Then 4 &amp; -4 is 4 → next idx is 8, etc. So this seems correct.But when you update a position, you set the tree[idx] to the maximum of current and the new value. Then propagate up to the parent nodes. Each parent node is responsible for a range that includes the current index. So when you update a node, you check if the new value is greater than the parent&#39;s current maximum, and update accordingly.Wait, but in the code above, the update sets tree[idx] to the maximum between its current value and the new value. If the new value is not larger than the current value, then we break the loop. Because if the current node&#39;s value is already higher than the new value, then the parent nodes (which cover ranges including this index) will have already accounted for a higher value, so no need to update them.This is correct. For example, if the new value is 5, and the current node&#39;s value is 5 or higher, then the parent nodes (which track the max of their ranges) would already have a value &gt;=5. So no need to update.So the Fenwick Tree for maximum is implemented correctly.Now, putting it all together.Steps to implement the solution:1. Read the input array.2. Create a sorted_unique list of the array&#39;s unique elements, sorted.3. For each element in the original array, compute its compressed index using bisect_left on the sorted_unique list.4. Initialize a Fenwick Tree of size equal to the length of sorted_unique.5. Iterate through each element in the original array:   a. Get the compressed index k.   b. If k ==0: output -1.   c. Else: query the Fenwick Tree from 1 to k. The maximum value in this range is the answer.      i. If the maximum is -infinity, output -1.      ii. Else, output the maximum.   d. Update the Fenwick Tree at position k+1 (since Fenwick is 1-based) with the value sorted_unique[k].Wait, no. Because the Fenwick Tree&#39;s indices are 1-based. So the compressed index k (0-based) in the sorted_unique list corresponds to the Fenwick Tree index k+1. But when we query up to k (original 0-based), the Fenwick Tree query is up to k (since the original query is for [0, k-1] 0-based, which translates to Fenwick Tree indices 1 to k).Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the steps correctly.For example:sorted_unique is [2,3,5]. The compressed indices are 0,1,2 (0-based).The Fenwick Tree&#39;s indices are 1,2,3 (1-based).So when processing an element with compressed index k in 0-based:- The Fenwick Tree&#39;s position for that element is k+1.But when we query for elements less than k (0-based), which is 0-based [0, k-1], which translates to Fenwick Tree indices 1 to k (since (k-1)+1 =k).So for example, if the compressed index is 2 (0-based), elements less than it are 0 and 1 (0-based), which are Fenwick Tree positions 1 and 2. So the query is 1 to 2.Thus, during the query, the code calls the FenwickTree.query(k), where k is the 0-based compressed index.But the FenwickTree&#39;s query takes a 1-based index. Wait, no.Wait, in the Fenwick Tree&#39;s query, the parameter &#39;idx&#39; is the 1-based index up to which we want to query. So for the 0-based compressed index k, the query is for FenwickTree.query(k).Because:In the example where the compressed index is 1 (0-based), the query is for 0-based [0,0], which is Fenwick indices 1-1=0? No. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that when k is the 0-based compressed index, then the elements to consider are those with 0-based indices less than k. For example, if k=2 (0-based), then elements with 0-based indices 0 and 1.These correspond to Fenwick Tree indices 1 and 2 (since 0-based 0 is Fenwick 1, 0-based 1 is Fenwick 2). So the query is for the maximum in the range 1 to 2 (Fenwick indices). So how do we compute 2 from k=2 (0-based)? Because the 0-based k is 2, which is the third element in sorted_unique. So the elements less than k are 0 and 1 (0-based), which in Fenwick indices are 1 and 2. So the query is up to k (0-based k=2) → no, the query is up to k-1=1 (0-based) → Fenwick indices 1+1=2? Wait, I&#39;m getting confused.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s easier to separate the steps:For the current element&#39;s compressed index k (0-based in sorted_unique):- The elements that are strictly less than it are those in sorted_unique[0...k-1]. So their 0-based indices in sorted_unique are 0 to k-1.- Each of these corresponds to Fenwick Tree indices 1 to k (since 0-based index i in sorted_unique is Fenwick Tree index i+1).So the Fenwick Tree query is for indices 1 to k.Because:sorted_unique indices (0-based) 0 → Fenwick index 1sorted_unique indices (0-based) 1 → Fenwick index 2...sorted_unique indices (0-based) k-1 → Fenwick index k.Thus, the query is from 1 to k.So when the compressed index of the current element is k (0-based), the query is for the Fenwick Tree&#39;s indices 1 to k.But k is the 0-based compressed index. So in the code:if k ==0:   answer is -1else:   max_val = fenwick.query(k)So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s query function is called with k, which is the 0-based compressed index. Because for k=1 (0-based), the query is for Fenwick indices 1 to 1 (which is k=1).For example:k=0 → no elements, answer is -1.k=1 → query 1 to 1 (Fenwick indices) → gives the maximum in sorted_unique[0], which is Fenwick index 1.Yes.Thus, the code for each element is:for element in arr:   k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_unique, element)   if k ==0:       res.append(-1)   else:       max_val = fenwick.query(k)       res.append(max_val if max_val != -inf else -1)   fenwick.update(k+1, element)Wait, but the elements in the Fenwick Tree are sorted_unique[k], not the original element. Because the compressed index is based on the sorted_unique list. So if the element is x, and x is in sorted_unique[k], then sorted_unique[k] =x.So when updating the Fenwick Tree, we need to store x (the element&#39;s value) at position k+1 in the Fenwick Tree. Because the Fenwick Tree&#39;s indices are 1-based. So for 0-based compressed index k, the Fenwick Tree&#39;s index is k+1.But in the Fenwick Tree, the stored value is the maximum value for that compressed index. Since sorted_unique[k] is x, and any elements with the same compressed index will have the same x. So when updating, we can just set the Fenwick Tree&#39;s position k+1 to max(current value, x). Since x is the value of sorted_unique[k], and any elements with the same compressed index k will have the same x. So once the position k+1 is set to x, subsequent updates with the same x will not change anything.Thus, the code for updating the Fenwick Tree is:fenwick.update(k+1, x)But x is the current element&#39;s value, which is equal to sorted_unique[k]. Because the compressed index is obtained via bisect_left on sorted_unique.Wait, no. Because the sorted_unique list is sorted, but the elements in the original array may have duplicates. For example, if the sorted_unique is [2,3], and the original array has [2,2,3], then the compressed index of the first two elements is 0 (bisect_left returns 0 for 2 in the sorted_unique list). The third element&#39;s compressed index is 1.So when processing the first 2:k =0 → compressed index 0.Fenwick Tree update is k+1 =1, value is 2.The Fenwick Tree at position 1 is set to 2.Then, processing the second 2:k=0 again. The Fenwick Tree&#39;s position 1 is already 2, so when we update with 2 again, since 2 is not larger than the current value, the Fenwick Tree&#39;s update will not change anything.Thus, the Fenwick Tree correctly tracks the maximum for each compressed index.Thus, the code steps are correct.Now, implementing this in Python.But first, some points to note:- The sorted_unique list must be sorted in ascending order.- For handling elements not present in the sorted_unique list (but wait, sorted_unique is built from the array&#39;s unique elements. So every element in the array is present in the sorted_unique list. Because when building sorted_unique, we take the array, create a set (to get unique elements), sort them. So no. For example, if the array has elements [1,2,2,3], the set is {1,2,3}, sorted to [1,2,3]. So the compressed index for 2 is 1. So yes, bisect_left will correctly find the index.So the code steps:1. Create a sorted_unique list by sorted(list(set(arr))).Wait, no. Because if the array has duplicates, sorted(list(set(arr))) will contain the unique elements in sorted order. But when processing elements in the original array, which may have duplicates, bisect_left on sorted_unique may not find the correct compressed index for elements that are duplicates. For example, if the original array has [2,2,3], sorted_unique is [2,3]. The compressed index for each 2 is 0, which is correct. Because bisect_left returns the first occurrence of 2 in sorted_unique.Yes.Thus, the steps to create the sorted_unique list are:sorted_unique = sorted(set(arr))But wait, in Python, the set will lose order, but when we sorted it, the order is correct. However, if the array has elements that are not unique, the set will have them once. So sorted_unique will be sorted list of unique elements.Thus, the code for sorted_unique is:sorted_unique = sorted(set(arr))But this is incorrect. Because for an array like [3,1,2,3], set(arr) is {1,2,3}, sorted becomes [1,2,3]. So when processing elements like 3, bisect_left gives 2, which is correct.Yes.But what if the array has elements that are not present in the sorted_unique list? Because we have taken the unique elements. But in the original array, the elements are present. For example, the array has [2,2,3]. The sorted_unique is [2,3]. So when processing the first 2, bisect_left returns 0. The second 2 also returns 0. The third 3 returns 1. So this is correct.So the sorted_unique list is correct.But in this case, the Fenwick Tree is initialized to have a size of len(sorted_unique). Which is the number of unique elements. But when the array has N=1e6 elements, but many duplicates, the len(sorted_unique) could be much smaller than N. For example, if all elements are the same, sorted_unique will have length 1. So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s size is 1. So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s update and query operations will be O(log m), where m is the number of unique elements. Which for m=1e5 is manageable.Thus, the code can proceed.Now, let&#39;s put it all together.But first, in Python, the bisect module&#39;s bisect_left function can be used.But the code for the function Smallestonleft(arr, n):def Smallestonleft(arr, n):    # code hereSo, the steps:sorted_unique = sorted(list(set(arr)))Wait, but list(set(arr)) will lose order, but when sorted, it doesn&#39;t matter. So sorted_unique is the sorted list of unique elements.Then, for each element in arr, compute k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_unique, x).But wait, sorted_unique is a list of unique elements sorted in ascending order. So for x in arr, bisect_left returns the index where x is found in sorted_unique. Since sorted_unique contains x (since x is in arr, and sorted_unique is made from the unique elements of arr).Thus, for each x in arr:k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_unique, x)Then, if k ==0: output -1.Else: query the Fenwick Tree for the maximum in the range 1 to k (Fenwick indices).But in the Fenwick Tree, the index for sorted_unique[k] is k+1.Wait, no. The Fenwick Tree is initialized with size m = len(sorted_unique). The Fenwick Tree&#39;s indices are 1-based, from 1 to m.Thus, the compressed index k (0-based) for sorted_unique is in the range 0 to m-1. So the Fenwick Tree&#39;s indices are 1 to m.Thus, when updating the Fenwick Tree for the current element x (which is sorted_unique[k]), the index in the Fenwick Tree is k+1.Thus, the code for the update is:fenwick.update(k+1, x)But x is equal to sorted_unique[k], since x is in arr and sorted_unique is the sorted list of unique elements, and k is the index found via bisect_left.Thus, the code is correct.But let&#39;s test with example 1:Example 1:Input: arr = [2,3,4,5,1]sorted_unique = sorted(set(arr)) → [1,2,3,4,5]Processing each element:First element is 2. bisect_left returns 1 (since sorted_unique is [1,2,3,4,5], and 2 is at index 1). Since k=1, query the Fenwick Tree for 1 to 1. But Fenwick Tree is initially all -inf. So the query returns -inf → output -1. Then update Fenwick Tree at index 2 (1+1) with 2.Second element is 3. bisect_left returns 2. k=2. query 1 to 2. The Fenwick Tree has index 2 updated to 2. So the maximum is 2. Output 2. Then update Fenwick Tree index 3 (2+1) with 3.Third element is 4. bisect_left returns 3. query 1-3. Fenwick Tree has 2 and 3. Max is 3. Output 3. Update index 4 with 4.Fourth element is 5. bisect_left returns 4. query 1-4. Max is 4. Output 4. Update index 5 with5.Fifth element is 1. bisect_left returns 0. So output -1. Update index 1 (0+1) with 1. But since 1 is the first element in sorted_unique, index 1 in Fenwick Tree is updated to 1.Thus, the output is [-1, 2, 3,4, -1], which matches the example.Another example:Example 2:Input: [1,2,3]. sorted_unique is [1,2,3].Processing first element 1: k=0 → output -1. Update index 1 with 1.Second element 2: k=1. query 1-1 (Fenwick index 1). Max is 1. Output 1. Update index 2 with 2.Third element 3: k=2. query 1-2 → max is 2. Output 2. Update index 3 with3. So output is [-1,1,2], which matches.So the code works for these examples.Now, implementing the code.But first, in Python, the Fenwick Tree must be implemented as a class or with helper functions.But for large N (1e6), the code must be efficient.But for len(sorted_unique) being up to 1e6 (if all elements are unique), the Fenwick Tree&#39;s size is 1e6. Which is manageable.So the code steps in Python:import bisectclass FenwickTree:    def __init__(self, size):        self.n = size        self.tree = [-float(&#39;inf&#39;)] * (self.n + 1)  # 1-based        def update(self, idx, value):        # idx is 1-based        while idx &lt;= self.n:            if value &gt; self.tree[idx]:                self.tree[idx] = value            else:                break  # no need to update further            idx += idx &amp; -idx        def query(self, idx):        # returns max from 1 to idx (1-based)        res = -float(&#39;inf&#39;)        while idx &gt; 0:            if self.tree[idx] &gt; res:                res = self.tree[idx]            idx -= idx &amp; -idx        return resdef Smallestonleft(arr, n):    if n ==0:        return []    # create sorted_unique    sorted_unique = sorted(set(arr))    m = len(sorted_unique)    fenwick = FenwickTree(m)    res = []    for x in arr:        # find k in sorted_unique        k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_unique, x)        if k ==0:            res.append(-1)        else:            max_val = fenwick.query(k)            res.append(max_val if max_val != -float(&#39;inf&#39;) else -1)        # update the fenwick tree at position k+1 (1-based)        # since sorted_unique is sorted, x is sorted_unique[k]        # but x is from the original array, which may have duplicates. So sorted_unique[k] is &lt;=x. But because sorted_unique is built from set(arr), which includes x, sorted_unique[k] is exactly x.        # So x == sorted_unique[k]        fenwick.update(k+1, x)    return resBut wait, what if the original array has elements that are not in the sorted_unique list? For example, if the array is [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], the sorted_unique is [1,2,3,4,5]. Each element in the array is present in the sorted_unique list. So x is equal to sorted_unique[k], because bisect_left finds the first occurrence of x in the sorted_unique list, and since x is in the list, sorted_unique[k] ==x.But if the array has duplicate elements, like [2,2,3], the sorted_unique is [2,3]. For the first 2, bisect_left returns 0, sorted_unique[0] is 2. So x == sorted_unique[k] is true.Thus, in the Fenwick Tree update, x is equal to the value stored in sorted_unique[k], so the code is correct.Testing the code with example 1:Input: [2,3,4,5,1]sorted_unique is [1,2,3,4,5]Processing elements:x=2: k=1 (bisect_left([1,2,3,4,5], 2) returns 1). Since k=1, query Fenwick Tree from 1 to 1 → -inf. So output is -1. Then update Fenwick Tree index 2 (1+1) with 2.x=3: k=2. Query 1-2 → max is 2. Output 2. Update index 3 with3.x=4: k=3. Query 1-3 → max 3. Output 3. Update index 4 with4.x=5: k=4. Query 1-4 → max 4. Output4. Update index5 with5.x=1: k=0 → output-1. Update index 1 with1.Output is [-1,2,3,4,-1], correct.Another test case: input [1,2,3], output [-1,1,2].Thus, the code seems to work.But wait, in the code for the FenwickTree&#39;s update, the index is k+1 (1-based). But what if the Fenwick Tree&#39;s size is m (len(sorted_unique)), and k+1 exceeds m?For example, if sorted_unique has length 5 (indices 0-4). Fenwick Tree&#39;s size is 5. The indices are 1-5. So for k=4 (0-based), k+1=5. Which is within the Fenwick Tree&#39;s size.Yes.Thus, the code should be correct.But the problem states that N can be up to 1e6. So the code must be efficient enough.The time complexity is O(N log M), where M is the number of unique elements in arr. For the worst case where all elements are unique, M is 1e6, so log M is about 20. Thus, 1e6 * 20 = 2e7 operations, which is acceptable.The bisect_left for each element is O(log M), and the Fenwick Tree&#39;s update and query are each O(log M). So overall O(N log M) time, which meets the problem&#39;s expected time complexity.The space complexity is O(M) for the Fenwick Tree and sorted_unique list, which is acceptable as per the problem&#39;s expected auxiliary space.Thus, the code should be correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest element on the left of every element in an array that is strictly smaller than itself. If no such element exists, we should return -1 for that position. The solution must be efficient enough to handle large input sizes up to 1,000,000 elements. Approach1. Problem Analysis: For each element in the array, we need to look at all previous elements and find the maximum value that is strictly smaller than the current element. A naive approach would be O(n^2), which is too slow. Instead, we use a more efficient approach using a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) for range maximum queries and coordinate compression to handle large values efficiently.2. Coordinate Compression: Convert the array elements into compressed indices based on their sorted unique values. This helps in reducing the range of values we need to handle, making it feasible to use a Fenwick Tree.3. Fenwick Tree for Range Maximum Queries: Maintain a Fenwick Tree to keep track of the maximum values encountered so far. This allows us to efficiently query the maximum value in a specific range and update the tree as we process each element. Solution Code```pythonimport bisectclass FenwickTree:    def __init__(self, size):        self.n = size        self.tree = [-float(&#39;inf&#39;)] * (self.n + 1)  # 1-based indexing        def update(self, idx, value):        # Update the Fenwick Tree at index &#39;idx&#39; with &#39;value&#39; (1-based index)        while idx &lt;= self.n:            if value &gt; self.tree[idx]:                self.tree[idx] = value            else:                break  # No need to propagate further            idx += idx &amp; -idx        def query(self, idx):        # Query the maximum value from index 1 to &#39;idx&#39; (1-based)        res = -float(&#39;inf&#39;)        while idx &gt; 0:            if self.tree[idx] &gt; res:                res = self.tree[idx]            idx -= idx &amp; -idx        return resdef Smallestonleft(arr, n):    if n == 0:        return []    # Create a sorted list of unique elements    sorted_unique = sorted(set(arr))    m = len(sorted_unique)    fenwick = FenwickTree(m)    result = []    for x in arr:        # Find the compressed index using bisect_left        k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_unique, x)        if k == 0:            result.append(-1)        else:            max_val = fenwick.query(k)            result.append(max_val if max_val != -float(&#39;inf&#39;) else -1)        # Update the Fenwick Tree with the current element&#39;s value at its compressed index + 1        fenwick.update(k + 1, x)    return result``` Explanation1. Coordinate Compression: We first create a sorted list of unique elements from the input array. This allows us to map each element to a compressed index, which reduces the range of values we need to handle.2. Fenwick Tree Initialization: We initialize a Fenwick Tree with a size equal to the number of unique elements. This tree will help us efficiently track the maximum values encountered so far.3. Processing Each Element: For each element in the input array:   - Determine its compressed index using binary search.   - If the element is the smallest (compressed index 0), append -1 to the result.   - Otherwise, query the Fenwick Tree for the maximum value in the range corresponding to elements smaller than the current one.   - Update the Fenwick Tree with the current element&#39;s value at its compressed index.This approach ensures that each query and update operation is performed in O(log M) time, where M is the number of unique elements, leading to an overall time complexity of O(N log N), which is efficient for large input sizes.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-cebbdad3 data-v-2e624778><div class="review" data-v-2e624778><div class="review-title" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>❓:</span>You are given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree and values to be inserted into the tree.

Let&#39;s think about how BST insertion works. First, the BST property: for any node, all left descendants are less than the node, and all right descendants are greater. So when inserting a new value, I have to find the correct position by comparing the value with the current nodes, starting from the root.The function is supposed to take the root of the tree and the data to insert. Wait, but looking at the input format, the original problem mentions a Node * insert function. But in Python, we don&#39;t have pointers, so I need to model the nodes as objects. Each node should have left and right children, and a data attribute.So the steps for insertion would be: if the root is None (meaning the tree is empty), create a new node with the data and return it. Otherwise, compare the data with the root&#39;s data. If it&#39;s less, recursively insert into the left subtree. If greater, insert into the right. But wait, how do we handle the case where we reach a leaf node? The recursion should take care of that. For example, if the current node&#39;s left is None and the data is less than current, we create a new node and assign it to left.Wait, but in Python, when you pass objects, you&#39;re passing references. So modifying the left or right of a node in the recursive calls should work. Wait, but the initial root might be None. So the base case is correct. Let me outline the steps.The function insert(root, data) does the following:1. If root is None, return a new node with data.2. Else, if data &lt; root.data:   a. Recursively insert into root.left. The result (the new subtree) is assigned to root.left.3. Else (data &gt; root.data, since BSTs typically don&#39;t allow duplicates. Wait, but the problem statement says nothing about duplicates. However, in BST insertion, if duplicates are allowed, they are sometimes placed on the left or right. But the sample input doesn&#39;t have duplicates. Maybe the problem assumes that all values are unique. So in this case, if data equals root.data, perhaps do nothing? Or the problem might assume that the data to be inserted is not present. But the problem says &quot;values to be inserted&quot;, so perhaps we can assume that duplicates are handled as per standard BST insertion. But the sample input doesn&#39;t have any. So perhaps, in this problem, we can proceed with inserting into the right when data is greater than or equal to. Wait, the problem&#39;s sample input is inserting 6 into a tree where 4 is root. Let me see the sample input: after inserting 6, it&#39;s added as the left child of 7. So 6 is less than 7, so it&#39;s inserted to the left. So the insertion follows the standard BST rules.So the algorithm is:If the root is None, create a new node.Else, if data is less than root.data, insert into left subtree.Else, insert into right subtree.Wait, but what if the left child is None? Then the insert function will create the node and assign it to the left. For example, in the sample input, inserting 6 into the tree. The root is 4, then 7. Since 6 is less than 7, it goes to the left of 7. The original left of 7 is None, so inserting 6 there creates a new node, which becomes the left child of 7.So the code structure would be:def insert(root, data):    if root is None:        return Node(data)    if data &lt; root.data:        root.left = insert(root.left, data)    else:        root.right = insert(root.right, data)    return rootWait, but in Python, the Node class needs to be properly defined. So assuming that the Node has a left and right attribute, and a data attribute.But the problem states that the function should take stdin as input and print the output. Wait, the original problem says to generate an executable Python function that reads from stdin. But how is the input structured?Wait, the original problem&#39;s input format shows a sample input which is the tree structure. But how is this input read from stdin? Oh wait, perhaps the input is given as a series of integers which are the nodes to be inserted into the BST. For example, the initial tree is built by inserting the values in some order. Wait, but the problem states that the function is given a pointer to the root of the BST and the values to insert. So perhaps the initial tree is already constructed, and the function is called for each value to insert.But the problem says, &quot;You are given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree and values to be inserted into the tree. Insert the values into their appropriate position in the binary search tree and return the root of the updated binary tree.&quot;Wait, but the function signature given is Node* insert(Node* root, int data). So for each value to insert, the insert function is called once. So in Python, the code would need to process all the values to insert, possibly through multiple calls to insert.But the problem statement says that the function should take stdin as input. Hmm, perhaps the input is given as a list of integers, where the first integer is the root of the tree, followed by the other nodes? Or maybe the input is a level-order traversal of the initial tree, followed by the values to insert.This is a bit ambiguous. Let&#39;s look at the sample input and output:Sample Input:The tree is:        4       /       2   7     /     1   3The value to be inserted is 6.Sample Output:         4       /         2     7     /    /    1   3 6So the initial tree is built with 4 as root, then inserting 2,7,1,3. Then inserting 6.But how is the initial tree passed as input? The problem says that the function is given the root. So perhaps in the code, the initial tree is built via a series of insertions. But when writing the Python code, the input would be read from stdin, which includes the initial tree and the values to insert.Wait, the user&#39;s problem says: &quot;Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt. The function should take stdin as input and print the output. Simply call the function after the definition.&quot;So the function should read from standard input. How is the input structured? Let&#39;s think. The input probably starts with the elements to build the initial BST, followed by the value(s) to insert. But the problem&#39;s input format is unclear.Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read input where each line is a value to insert into the BST. For example, the initial BST is empty, and the code reads all values and inserts them one by one. But the sample input shows an existing tree. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Alternatively, maybe the input is a series of integers, where the first integer is the root, followed by the other nodes inserted in the order they are given, and then the values to be inserted. But that&#39;s not clear.Alternatively, perhaps the input is given as a level-order traversal of the initial tree, followed by the values to insert. For example, the sample input&#39;s initial tree is 4, 2, 7, 1, 3. So the level-order is 4, 2,7,1,3. Then inserting 6.But how to parse that from stdin. Hmm. The problem statement might not specify the exact input format, but the code needs to read from stdin. But the user&#39;s problem statement may have an error, since the original problem (from HackerRank or similar) would have a specific input method, but the user hasn&#39;t provided that.Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read a list of integers, the first integer is the root, then the rest are the values to insert. But the sample input shows that the existing tree is not empty. So perhaps the code first builds the initial tree, and then inserts the given data.Wait, the problem statement says: &quot;You are given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree and values to be inserted into the tree.&quot; So in the code, the initial root is passed to the insert function. But the code has to read the input which includes the initial tree and the values to insert.This is getting complicated. Let me re-examine the problem statement.The problem requires writing a Python function that takes stdin as input and prints the output. The function should insert a value into a BST and return the root. The sample input shows inserting 6 into an existing tree.But how is the initial tree represented in stdin? How is the data to insert provided?Alternatively, perhaps the input is a list of integers. The first integer is the number of nodes in the initial tree. Then the next N integers are the elements of the tree. Then the next value is the value to insert. But the sample input&#39;s initial tree has 5 nodes (4,2,7,1,3). Then inserting 6.But how to parse that. For example, the input could be:54 2 7 1 36But the code would read the 5 as the number of nodes, then the next line as the nodes in some order (pre-order, in-order, level-order?), then the 6 as the value to insert.But the problem&#39;s input format is not clear. The original problem&#39;s input format is probably a HackerRank-style input where the insert function is called once per value, but the user has modified it.Alternatively, perhaps the input is the root of the tree in a certain format, followed by the data to insert. For example, the tree is given as a list in level order, including None for missing nodes. For example, the sample input&#39;s initial tree is represented as [4,2,7,1,3,null,null], and the data is 6. But how would that be read from stdin.Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read all the elements in level order, and then insert them into the tree. For example, the first line is the elements to insert (including the initial tree) and the code builds the BST by inserting each element in the order given, then returns the root. But in the sample input, the initial tree is built by inserting 4, then 2, 7, 1, 3. Then inserting 6. So the input could be 4 2 7 1 3 6. Then the code inserts them one by one, but that would create a different tree. Wait, inserting 4, then 2, 7, 1, 3, then 6. But inserting 6 would start at 4, go right to 7, then left (since 6 &lt;7). So that would result in the sample output.But in that case, the code would read all the values and insert them sequentially. But the problem states that the initial tree is given and then the values to insert. So perhaps the input is split into two parts: the first part is the initial tree (how?), and the second is the values to insert.This is getting confusing. Since the problem&#39;s input format is not clearly specified, but the sample input shows that the function is supposed to insert a value into an existing tree and return the new root.But given that the user provided a sample input and output, perhaps the code needs to process the input in a specific way. Let&#39;s think of how the sample input and output are structured.Sample Input:The existing tree is:        4       /       2   7     /     1   3Value to insert is 6.Sample Output after insertion:         4       /         2     7     /    /    1   3 6So, the code must take the initial tree and the value to insert, then output the modified tree.But how is the initial tree represented in the input? Maybe the code reads the values in a certain order and constructs the initial tree. For example, the initial tree is built by inserting 4, then 2, 7, 1, 3. Then insert 6.So the input to the code could be a list of values to insert into an initially empty tree, including the initial tree&#39;s elements and the new elements. But in that case, the code would process all values in sequence.But that approach would work. For example, the code could read all values from stdin, insert them one by one into the BST, and then print the final tree.But the problem says, &quot;You are given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree and values to be inserted into the tree.&quot; So the function is called with the existing root and the data. But in the code, the function would need to handle that. But since the code is supposed to read from stdin, perhaps the code is supposed to read all the values (including the initial tree and the data to insert), build the initial tree, then insert the new data.But how to separate initial tree elements from the data to insert?Alternatively, perhaps the input is structured as follows: the first line is the number of elements in the initial tree. The second line is the elements of the initial tree. The third line is the number of elements to insert. The fourth line is the elements to insert.For example, sample input would be:54 2 7 1 316Then the code builds the initial tree by inserting 4,2,7,1,3 (in the order given?), then inserts 6, then outputs the resulting tree.But the order of insertion affects the structure of the BST. For example, inserting the same elements in different orders can result in different trees. So if the initial tree is built by inserting in the order 4, 2, 7, 1, 3, then inserting 6 gives the sample output.But if the initial tree is built in a different order, the structure would be different.So perhaps the code is supposed to build the initial tree by inserting the elements in the order they are provided. Then insert the new elements in the order provided.But the problem&#39;s input format is unclear, so perhaps the code should assume that the input is a list of integers to insert into the BST in the order given, and the function is called for each insertion. But the code must read from stdin and output the tree.Alternatively, perhaps the code reads the entire input as a list of integers. The first integer is the root, and the rest are the values to insert. So for example, the input is:4 2 7 1 3 6Which would correspond to the sample input. Then the code builds the initial tree by inserting 4, then 2, 7, 1, 3, then 6, and then prints the tree.But how would the code know which values are part of the initial tree and which are to be inserted. Oh, perhaps the problem is that the initial tree is the root, and the code has to insert the other values. So for example, the first value is the root&#39;s data, and the subsequent values are to be inserted. But in that case, the code would build the tree by inserting each value, starting with the root. But in the sample input, the initial tree is 4, then 2 is inserted, then 7, etc. So the code would read the input as a list, and insert each value one by one, starting with the first as the root.But in that case, the code would build the initial tree and insert the required values in the same way. So for the sample input, the code would read 4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6. Insert all of them into an empty tree, and then print the resulting tree. But that would work, as inserting in that order would create the sample output.So perhaps the code is supposed to read all the input values as the list of data to insert, build the BST by inserting them in order, and then print the root&#39;s data (but how to print the entire tree structure?).But the problem&#39;s sample output is a tree structure. However, the output requirement is to return the root of the updated BST. But how to print the output. The problem&#39;s sample output shows the tree structure, but how would the code output that.Ah, but the problem states, &quot;print the output.&quot; So perhaps the code is supposed to print the level order traversal of the tree after inserting all the elements.For example, the sample output would be printed as 4 2 7 1 3 6. But the sample output&#39;s tree in level order is 4, 2,7,1,3,6.But the problem&#39;s sample output shows a tree structure, but perhaps the code is supposed to print the tree in a certain format, perhaps in level order.Assuming that the code is to read all input values (split by whitespace) and insert them into a BST in the order they are given. Then output the level order traversal of the resulting tree.But the problem&#39;s sample input&#39;s initial tree is built by inserting 4, 2,7,1,3, then inserting 6. So the input would be 4 2 7 1 3 6. Inserting each in that order. Then the code prints the level order traversal, which is 4,2,7,1,3,6.So the code would read all the input values, insert them into the BST, then print the level order traversal.But the problem states that the function is to be generated, which takes stdin and prints the output. So the code should read all the input values, insert them into the BST in the order they are given, and then print the level order traversal of the tree.So the steps are:1. Read the input values from stdin as integers.2. Insert each value into the BST, starting with an empty tree.3. After all insertions, print the level order traversal of the BST.So the code would involve:- A Node class with data, left, right.- The insert function as described.- Reading the input line, split into integers.- Insert each integer in sequence.- Perform level order traversal (BFS) and print the data in order, separated by spaces.But in the sample input, inserting 4,2,7,1,3,6 gives the tree as in the sample output, and the level order traversal is 4,2,7,1,3,6.So the code would output &quot;4 2 7 1 3 6&quot;.But the sample output&#39;s tree has 6 as the left child of 7. So the level order would have 4 as root, then 2 and 7, then 1,3,6. So the level order traversal is 4 2 7 1 3 6.Yes.So the code should process the input as a list of integers, inserting each into the BST in order, then output the level order traversal.Now, the code:First, define the Node class.class Node:    def __init__(self, data):        self.data = data        self.left = None        self.right = NoneThe insert function:def insert(root, data):    if root is None:        return Node(data)    if data &lt; root.data:        root.left = insert(root.left, data)    else:        root.right = insert(root.right, data)    return rootThen, read the input. For example, input could be a line of numbers, like &#39;4 2 7 1 3 6&#39; split into list.But the code needs to read from stdin. So in Python:import sysdef main():    # Read all input data    data_values = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))    root = None    for val in data_values:        root = insert(root, val)    # Now perform level order traversal and print    # Level order traversal using a queue    queue = [root]    result = []    while queue:        current = queue.pop(0)        result.append(str(current.data))        if current.left:            queue.append(current.left)        if current.right:            queue.append(current.right)    print(&#39; &#39;.join(result))But what if the input is empty? Then root is None, and the code would have an empty queue, leading to an error. But according to constraints, the number of nodes is &lt;=500, but if there are zero nodes, perhaps the function returns an empty tree.But the code should handle that. So in the case where there are zero nodes, the loop won&#39;t run, and result is empty. Then &#39; &#39;.join(result) would be an empty string. So the code would print nothing. But according to the problem statement, when there are no nodes, inserting nothing would return an empty tree. So that&#39;s handled.Testing with the sample input:Input is 4 2 7 1 3 6. Insert in order:- Insert 4: root is Node(4)- Insert 2: 2 &lt;4, inserted as left child.- Insert7:7&gt;4, inserted as right child.- Insert1:1&lt;4, go left to 2, 1&lt;2, inserted as left child.- Insert3:3&lt;4, go left to 2, 3&gt;2, inserted as right child.- Insert6:6&gt;4, go right to7,6&lt;7, inserted as left child.Then the level order traversal is 4,2,7,1,3,6. So the code would output that.But how to handle the input. For example, if the input is given via standard input, like:4 2 7 1 3 6The code would read all values, insert them in order, then output the level order.So the code seems correct.But the function&#39;s name is main? Or should we call it? The code should call the function after definition. So the code would end with:if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()Putting it all together:Full code:class Node:    def __init__(self, data):        self.data = data        self.left = None        self.right = Nonedef insert(root, data):    if root is None:        return Node(data)    if data &lt; root.data:        root.left = insert(root.left, data)    else:        root.right = insert(root.right, data)    return rootimport sysdef main():    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))    root = None    for val in data:        root = insert(root, val)    # Level order traversal    if not root:        print()        return    queue = [root]    result = []    while queue:        node = queue.pop(0)        result.append(str(node.data))        if node.left:            queue.append(node.left)        if node.right:            queue.append(node.right)    print(&#39; &#39;.join(result))if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()Wait, but when the tree is empty (no data), the code checks if not root, and prints a new line. Otherwise, performs BFS. So for the case where data is empty (no input), the code prints a new line. But that&#39;s correct.Testing with the sample input:Input is 4 2 7 1 3 6. Output is 4 2 7 1 3 6. Which matches the level order traversal.Yes. So the code should work.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to insert a given value into a binary search tree (BST) and return the root of the updated BST. The solution involves constructing the BST from the input values and then inserting the specified value while maintaining the BST properties.  Approach1. Binary Search Tree Insertion: The insertion into a BST follows a specific property where each node&#39;s left subtree contains values less than the node, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node. We recursively traverse the tree to find the appropriate position for the new value.2. Input Handling: The input is read as a list of integers from standard input. Each integer is inserted into the BST in the order they appear.3. Level Order Traversal: After constructing the BST with all the input values, we perform a level order traversal (Breadth-First Search) to print the structure of the tree. Solution Code```pythonclass Node:    def __init__(self, data):        self.data = data        self.left = None        self.right = Nonedef insert(root, data):    if root is None:        return Node(data)    if data &lt; root.data:        root.left = insert(root.left, data)    else:        root.right = insert(root.right, data)    return rootimport sysdef main():    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))    root = None    for val in data:        root = insert(root, val)    if not root:        print()        return    queue = [root]    result = []    while queue:        node = queue.pop(0)        result.append(str(node.data))        if node.left:            queue.append(node.left)        if node.right:            queue.append(node.right)    print(&#39; &#39;.join(result))if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation1. Node Class: This class represents a node in the BST, each containing data, a left child, and a right child.2. Insert Function: This function recursively inserts a value into the BST. If the current node is `None`, a new node is created. Otherwise, the value is inserted into the left or right subtree based on BST properties.3. Main Function: This function reads the input values, constructs the BST by inserting each value sequentially, and then performs a level order traversal to print the tree structure. The traversal uses a queue to visit nodes level by level, ensuring the output reflects the tree&#39;s structure accurately.This approach ensures that each insertion maintains the BST properties and efficiently constructs the tree. The level order traversal then provides a clear, structured output of the tree&#39;s nodes.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2e624778></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2e624778><span class="icon" data-v-2e624778>🔑:</span></p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-cebbdad3><span data-v-cebbdad3>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
