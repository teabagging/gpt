His Scotland Yard colleagues often provide him with a set of evidence and ask for his help in solving the mysteries. After many years of practice, Holmes has gained an enormous amount of experience and already knows causes for many common events, which, combined with his extraordinary deductive capabilities, enables him to solve cases in a matter of minutes, from the comfort of his chair.Holmes’ knowledge base can be modeled as a set of implications of the form A rightarrow B (where A and B represent events), which means that, if A occurred, event B must have also occurred (remember that logical implication is false only if A is true and B is false). Of course, implications can form chains of reasoning, e.g., A rightarrow B rightarrow C. However, there will never be a circular chain of implications (e.g., A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow cdots rightarrow A).Holmes is given a set S = { S_1, S_2, S_3, ldots , S_ n }  of events that are known to have occurred. He can then, using his extensive knowledge and deductive powers, find all events that have certainly occurred.It’s important to note that Holmes’ knowledge is so mind-bogglingly huge that he knows all possible causes of events. In other words, there is no implication that is true, but not included in Holmes’ knowledge base. This means that if an event A occurred and A is known to be implied by some other event(s), then at least one of those other event(s) must have occurred as well.Many detective agencies would highly appreciate Holmes’ one of a kind capabilities, so you were given a task to accomplish with a computer what is out of reach for ordinary mortals. Write a program to find all events that have certainly occurred based on the given implications and evidence collected by your colleague detectives.-----Input-----The first line of input consists of three integers, D (1 le D le 1000), the number of different types of events, M (1 le M le 100000), the number of implications, and N (1 le N le D), the number of events known to have occurred.Each of the M lines that follow contains two integers A and B (1 le A, B le D), describing an implication A rightarrow B.Finally, each of the last N lines contains an integer X (1 le X le D) describing an event that is known to have occurred, based on the evidence collected by detectives.-----Output-----The first and only line of output should contain integers (in increasing order) representing events that have certainly occurred.-----Explanation of sample cases-----In Sample Input 2, the knowledge base contains implications 1 rightarrow 3 and 2 rightarrow 3. Therefore, Holmes knows that event 3 can be caused only by events 1 and 2, but (without any extra information), he can’t be certain which one of those events actually caused 3. As a result, the only event that must have occurred is the one given in the input.In Sample Input 3, Holmes doesn’t know which event from the set { 2, 3}  is directly responsible for event 4. However, as both of those events are caused only by event 1, Holmes can deduce that event 1 must have occurred. As a consequence, events 2, 3 and 4 (given by the detectives) have also occurred.-----Examples-----Sample Input 1:3 2 11 22 32Sample Output 1:1 2 3Sample Input 2:3 2 11 32 33Sample Output 2:3</div><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🧠:</span>Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem. So, we need to determine all events that must have certainly occurred based on the given implications and the initial set of events. Hmm.The key point here is that Holmes knows all possible implications, and if an event is present in the set S, then at least one of its causes (events that imply it) must also be present. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: &quot;if an event A occurred and A is known to be implied by some other event(s), then at least one of those other event(s) must have occurred as well.&quot; Oh right. So this is like a closure. But in reverse? Because normally, implications are forward. For example, if A implies B, then if A is true, B must be true. But here, if B is true (i.e., occurred), then because all possible implications are known, if B is caused by any events (like A implies B), then at least one of those causes must have occurred. So, the set S must satisfy that for every event in S, if there are any events that imply it (i.e., A → B implies B&#39;s causes?), wait no. Wait, the implication is A → B. So A is a cause for B. Because if A happens, then B must happen. So for B to be in the set S, all the necessary causes must have at least one of them present. Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.The note says: &quot;if an event A occurred and A is known to be implied by some other event(s), then at least one of those other event(s) must have occurred as well.&quot; So, if there are events that imply A (i.e., in the knowledge base, there are implications X → A), then at least one of those X&#39;s must be present in the set S. Otherwise, it&#39;s a contradiction. Because according to the note, Holmes knows all possible implications, so if A is present and there are X&#39;s that imply A, then one of those X&#39;s must be present. So, the initial S provided must already satisfy this condition. But our task is to compute the minimal closure of S such that all events that must have occurred given the implications.Wait, but how do we model this? Because for each event in S, if there are any implications leading to it (i.e., events that can cause it), then at least one of those must be present. But that seems like a constraint on S. So, the initial S must be such that for each event in S, if there are any predecessors (events that imply it), then at least one predecessor is also in S. Otherwise, the initial S is invalid. But the problem statement says that the input gives S as the events known to have occurred. So perhaps the input S is already valid. But we need to compute the closure.Wait, the problem says that Holmes can find all events that have certainly occurred. So the initial set S is given, and using the implications, we need to find all events that must have occurred. But the note complicates things. Because according to the note, if an event A is in S, and there are implications that can imply A (i.e., events B such that B → A), then at least one of those B&#39;s must also be in S. Because otherwise, the presence of A in S is invalid. But wait, the problem says that the input gives the set S of events known to have occurred. So perhaps the input is such that S is valid, meaning that for each event in S, if there are any implications leading to it (predecessors), then S contains at least one of those predecessors. But that&#39;s not stated. Wait, the note says that Holmes knows all possible causes. So, the initial S is such that if any event in S has possible causes (predecessors in the implication graph), then S must include at least one of them. Otherwise, the initial S is impossible. But the input given to us is the S provided by the detectives, which is valid. So, the initial S is correct and we need to compute the closure of events that must be present.So, the process is to start with the initial S, and then for each event in S, include all events that are implied by them. Because implications are forward. For example, if A → B, and A is in S, then B must be in the closure. But also, if B is in S, then we need to make sure that all the events that imply B are considered. Wait, no. Wait, the note says that if A is in S, then all events that A implies must be included. But the problem&#39;s note says that for any event in S, all of their implied events are included. But also, the note imposes a condition on the initial S: for any event in S, if there are events that imply it, then at least one of them must be present. So, the initial S must satisfy that. But the input&#39;s S is given, and we have to process it.But how do these two aspects interact? Let&#39;s think of the sample input 2:Sample Input 2:3 2 11 32 33Sample Output 2: 3The implications are 1→3 and 2→3. The initial S is {3}. Now, according to the note, since 3 is present and it&#39;s implied by 1 and 2, at least one of 1 or 2 must be present. But they are not in S. So, how does this fit with the note? Wait, the note says that if an event A occurred (is in S) and A is known to be implied by some other events (i.e., there are implications leading to A), then at least one of those must be present. So in this case, 3 is in S, but neither 1 nor 2 are present. But according to the note, that&#39;s impossible. So why is the input valid here?Ah, perhaps the initial S is not required to satisfy that condition. The problem says that the input is the events known to have occurred. But according to Holmes&#39;s knowledge, which includes all possible implications, the presence of 3 in S implies that at least one of 1 or 2 must also be present. But the input S only has 3. So how is that possible?Wait, but the problem states that the input is the set S of events known to have occurred. So perhaps the initial S is the set of events that have definitely happened, and the process of deduction is to find all events that must have occurred, given the implications and the fact that S must be consistent with the implications. So, if S contains an event A, but there&#39;s no event in S that can imply A (i.e., no predecessors in S), then the only way this can happen is if A has no predecessors in the implication graph. Because if there are predecessors, then according to the note, the initial S must have at least one of them. So perhaps the input S is already valid, meaning that for every event in S that has predecessors (i.e., events that imply it), at least one of those predecessors is also present in S.But how can we model this? Because when we process S, we have to make sure that all events in the final closure must include all events that are implied, and also all events that are required by the note&#39;s condition.Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: the set S must form a closure under the reverse implications. Because each event in S must have all its required causes (if any) present. But the note&#39;s condition is that if there are any events that imply A (i.e., can cause A), then at least one of them must be in S. So the set S must be such that for every A in S, if there exists any B where B → A, then there exists at least one such B in S. Otherwise, the set S is invalid. But the problem states that the input is given as S, so perhaps we can assume that the input is valid. However, in the sample input 2, the S is {3}, and there are implications 1→3 and 2→3. So according to the note, the input is invalid. But the sample output is 3. So there&#39;s a contradiction here. Wait, perhaps I&#39;m misunderstanding the note.Wait, the note says: &quot;if an event A occurred and A is known to be implied by some other event(s), then at least one of those other event(s) must have occurred as well.&quot; So, if A is in S, and there are implications that imply A (i.e., events B where B → A), then at least one of those B must be present in S. Otherwise, the presence of A is impossible, since all possible implications are known. So the initial S must satisfy this condition. Therefore, the input provided is valid, meaning that for every event in the input S, if there exists any implication leading to it (i.e., any B → A), then the input S must contain at least one such B. Otherwise, the input is invalid, but according to the problem statement, the input is valid.Wait, but in sample input 2, the initial S is {3}, which has implications 1→3 and 2→3. So according to the note, the input S must have either 1 or 2 in it. But they are not present. So how is that possible? Oh, perhaps the note applies only to the events in the closure. Or perhaps the note is part of the problem&#39;s logic, and the initial S is not required to satisfy that, but the closure must.Wait, the problem says that the input gives a set S of events known to have occurred. The task is to find all events that must have certainly occurred, considering the implications and the note. So, the note&#39;s condition is part of the problem&#39;s logic. So, the initial S is given, but according to Holmes&#39;s knowledge, if an event in S is caused by other events, then at least one of those causes must also be in the final set. So, the process of finding the closure involves adding all such required causes.Wait, maybe the problem is to find the minimal superset of S that is closed under both forward implications and the reverse dependencies (i.e., for every event in the set, if there are any predecessors (causes), at least one of them is present in the set). But that seems like a tricky combination.Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to model the problem as follows:The set of events that must have occurred is the closure of S under two rules:1. If A is in the set, then all events implied by A (B where A → B) must be in the set. This is the forward implication closure.2. For every event B in the set, if there exists any implication A → B, then at least one of those A must be in the set. This is the reverse implication closure.But how to model this closure? Because the closure must satisfy both conditions.Wait, but the note says that Holmes&#39;s knowledge includes all possible implications. So, the set S must be such that for every event B in S, if there exists any implication A → B, then at least one A is present in S. Otherwise, the presence of B in S is impossible, because according to the note, all possible implications are known, so B can&#39;t have occurred unless at least one of its causes (A) occurred. Therefore, the initial S must already satisfy this condition. Otherwise, the problem&#39;s input is invalid. But the problem states that the input is valid. So the initial S is such that for every B in S, if there are any implications leading to B (A → B), then at least one A is in S.Therefore, when processing the input, we can assume that for each event in S, all required causes are already present. But how does this help us compute the closure?Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a DAG (since there are no cycles), and the initial S is a subset of nodes. For each node in the closure, all of its descendants (via forward implications) must be included. But also, for each node in the closure, all of its required ancestors (via reverse implications) must be included. But how?Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the set must be the minimal set containing S and satisfying two properties:- If a node is in the set, all its implied nodes (forward direction) must be in the set.- For every node in the set, if there&#39;s any node that implies it (reverse direction), then at least one such node must be present in the set.But how to compute such a closure?Let me think about sample input 3:Sample Input 3:4 3 11 21 32 43 44Sample Output 3:1 2 3 4The implications are:1→21→32→43→4The initial S is {4}. Now, according to the note, since 4 is present and it&#39;s implied by 2 and 3, at least one of them must be present. But they are not in the initial S. So the initial S is invalid unless there&#39;s a path. Wait, but according to the note, Holmes&#39;s knowledge includes all possible implications. So the initial S must be such that for any event in S, if there are predecessors, then at least one is present. So the input S {4} is invalid, but according to the sample input, the output includes 1, 2, 3, 4. How does this work?Wait, maybe the initial S is allowed to not satisfy the note&#39;s condition, but during the closure computation, we have to add all necessary events to make it satisfy. So, perhaps the process is to start with S, then for each event in S, if there are any implications leading to it (predecessors), and none of them are in the closure, then we have to add all possible predecessors (but that&#39;s not possible because the note says that at least one must be present). Wait, perhaps the closure is the minimal set that includes S and is closed under forward implications and for every event in the closure, at least one predecessor (if any exists) is also present.But how to compute this? Let&#39;s think about sample input 3:The initial S is {4}. But 4 has predecessors 2 and 3 (since 2→4 and 3→4). So according to the note, at least one of 2 or 3 must be present. But they are not in the initial S. So we need to add one of them. But since all possible implications are known, the only way 4 can be present is if at least one of 2 or 3 is present. But those two events have their own predecessors. 2 is implied by 1, and 3 is implied by 1. So if we add 2 to the closure, then we also have to add 1. Similarly for 3. But since the note requires that for each event in the closure, their predecessors must be covered.But since the problem requires that the closure must include all events that must have occurred, regardless of which path is taken, we have to include all events that are required in all possible scenarios. For example, in sample input 2, the presence of 3 requires that either 1 or 2 is present. But since the initial S does not contain them, how is that possible? Because according to the note, the initial S must have at least one of them. So perhaps the initial S in sample input 2 is invalid, but the sample output includes only 3. This suggests that my understanding is incorrect.Wait, perhaps the note is not a constraint on the initial S, but a constraint on the closure. The note says that Holmes knows all possible implications, and thus, the closure must include all events that must have occurred given the initial S and the implications. So, the initial S is given, and the closure must be built such that for every event in the closure, all events that imply it (i.e., predecessors) have at least one in the closure. So, the process is to include all events in the initial S, then for each event in the closure, add all events that they imply (forward closure), and also ensure that for each event in the closure, at least one predecessor (if any) is also present.But how to model this? Because the closure must be the minimal set containing S, closed under forward implications, and such that for each event in the closure, at least one predecessor (if any) is present.Alternatively, perhaps the closure is computed as follows:1. Start with the initial S.2. For each event in the closure, add all events that are implied by it (forward closure).3. Then, for each event in the closure, if there are any implications leading to it, check if at least one of the predecessors is in the closure. If not, then those predecessors must be added. But this seems like a loop.But this seems like a chicken and egg problem. Let&#39;s think of sample input 3 again. The initial S is {4}. The forward closure adds nothing (since 4 implies nothing). Then, check if 4&#39;s predecessors (2 and 3) are in the closure. They are not. So, according to the note, at least one of 2 or 3 must be present. But which one? Since the note says that Holmes knows all possible causes, but we can&#39;t know which one was the actual cause. However, in this case, both 2 and 3 are implied only by 1. So, regardless of which one is the cause, 1 must be present. Because 2 is implied by 1, and 3 is implied by 1. So, adding 1 would imply adding 2 and 3, which then imply 4. Thus, the closure must include 1, 2, 3, and 4.So the approach is to find all events that are required to exist in any possible scenario that includes the initial S and satisfies the note&#39;s conditions.Thus, the problem reduces to finding all events that must be present in every possible minimal closure that includes S and satisfies the implications.This sounds like we need to compute the intersection of all possible valid closures. But how?Alternatively, perhaps the events that must be in the closure are those that are in S, or are implied by any event in the closure (forward direction), and all ancestors that are required to exist because of the note&#39;s condition.But this is getting a bit unclear. Let&#39;s try to model the problem with an example.Sample Input 3:Implications:1 → 21 → 32 →43 →4Initial S: {4}So, for 4 to be in S, at least one of 2 or 3 must be present.But 2 can only be caused by 1.3 can only be caused by 1.So, regardless of whether 2 or 3 is chosen as the cause of 4, 1 must be present, because both 2 and 3 require 1. So, 1 must be in the closure. Then, since 1 is present, 2 and 3 must be added (forward closure). Then, since 2 and 3 are present, their implied events (4) are already present. So the closure is {1,2,3,4}.Thus, in this case, the closure includes all those events.So the process is to find all events that are required in all possible valid scenarios, given the initial S and the implications.Another example: Sample Input 2:Implications: 1→3, 2→3. Initial S: {3}Now, for 3 to be present, either 1 or 2 must be present. But there&#39;s no implications that lead to 1 or 2. So the possible scenarios are:Scenario 1: 3 and 1 are present. Then, 1 implies 3. But since 1 is present, are there any implications leading to 1? If not, then this scenario is valid.Scenario 2: 3 and 2 are present. Similarly valid.But the initial S is {3}, which in both scenarios requires adding either 1 or 2, but there&#39;s no way to determine which one. Thus, the only event that must be present in all possible closures is 3. So the output is {3}.So, the problem is to find the intersection of all possible valid closures. Each valid closure is a set that includes the initial S, is closed under forward implications, and for every event in the closure, if there are any predecessors (events that imply it), then at least one predecessor is present.So, how can we model this?The key insight is that an event X must be included in the closure if:- X is in the initial S, or- X is implied by some event in the closure.But also, for every event in the closure, if there are predecessors, at least one is present.But how to model this in code?Alternative approach:We can model the closure as the set of events that can be proven to have occurred by forward implications and mandatory causes.Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the closure in reverse. Starting from the initial S, and then for each event, adding all possible causes (predecessors) that are required.Wait, but that&#39;s not correct. Because for the sample input 3, the initial S is {4}, and we need to include 2 and 3, but each requires their predecessors (1). So, the closure must include 1, which then includes 2 and 3, which includes 4. So, the way to model this is to find the minimal set that includes the initial S, and for each event in the set, includes all their predecessors (but only those that are necessary).Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model this as a dependency graph, where for an event to be in the closure, all events that imply it (predecessors) must have at least one present, and the event must have all events that it implies (successors) present.Wait, but this seems circular. Let&#39;s think again.The forward closure is straightforward: if A is in the closure, then all events B where A implies B must also be in the closure.The reverse closure is trickier: if B is in the closure, then there must be at least one A where A implies B and A is also in the closure. But how to ensure this?So, perhaps the process is to first compute the forward closure, then for each event in the forward closure, check if all required predecessors are present. If not, add them, and recompute the forward closure.But this seems like a loop. For example, in sample input 3, after adding 4 to the forward closure, we check if it has any predecessors (2 and 3). Since none are present, we need to add at least one. But which one? Since both require 1, we must add both 2 and 3, which in turn requires adding 1. Then, 1&#39;s forward closure adds 2 and 3, which add 4. But this approach is not clear.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal closure is the set of events that are required in all possible valid closures. So, for an event to be in the output, every possible valid closure must include it.To find this, we can model the necessary events as follows:An event X must be included in the output if:- X is in the initial S, or- All paths from the initial S to X via forward implications require X to be included.Wait, perhaps that&#39;s not directly applicable.Alternatively, perhaps the events that must be included are those that are present in every possible valid closure. So, to compute this, we can find the intersection of all possible valid closures.But how to compute this efficiently?Another approach: The events that must be included are those that are reachable via all possible paths from the initial S, considering the forward and reverse implications.But I&#39;m not sure.Alternative Idea:The problem can be modeled using a dependency graph where each event&#39;s inclusion depends on certain conditions. For each event B in the closure:- All events implied by B (forward implications) must be included.- For all implications A → B, at least one A must be included in the closure (if there are any such implications).But this seems like a constraint that the closure must satisfy.The process of building the closure would involve starting with the initial S and expanding it to meet these constraints.But how to find all events that are in every possible such closure.Let me think in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.An event X must be in the output if:1. X is in the initial S, or2. X is implied by some event Y that is in the output (forward implication).Additionally, for every event Y in the output:3. If there are implications leading to Y, then at least one of them must be in the output.But how does condition 3 affect the output?This seems to create a kind of backward propagation. For example, if Y is in the output, and there are implications A → Y, then at least one A must be in the output. So, the output must include all such A&#39;s that are required by Y&#39;s presence.But since the output must include all events that are required in all possible cases, perhaps the way to model this is to find all events that are in the forward closure and all their &quot;mandatory&quot; predecessors.Wait, for example, in sample input 3:The initial S is {4}.The forward closure of 4 is {4}.But according to condition 3, since 4 is in the closure, and there are implications 2→4 and 3→4, then at least one of 2 or 3 must be present. But since both 2 and 3 have their own implications (1→2 and 1→3), and no other implications lead to them, the presence of either 2 or 3 requires 1. So, regardless of whether 2 or 3 is chosen, 1 must be present, which then adds 2 and 3 via forward closure. Thus, the output must include 1, 2, 3, and 4.So, the process is to find all events that are in the forward closure of S, and also any events that are required to be present due to the reverse implications.But how to model this.An alternative approach is to model this as a directed acyclic graph (since there are no cycles). Then, for each event in the initial S, we can find all events that are reachable via forward implications (their descendants), and all events that are required via backward implications (their ancestors).But the problem is that for backward implications, we need to have at least one ancestor present for each event.But how to compute the minimal set of required ancestors.Perhaps the required events are the intersection of all possible paths from the initial S to the ancestors.But this is getting complicated.Another Idea:The closure must include all events that are in the forward closure of S, and also all events that are required by the reverse implications.To compute the reverse implications, for each event in the closure, we need to ensure that all possible paths that could lead to it are covered. But since the graph is a DAG (no cycles), perhaps we can process the events in reverse topological order.For example, in sample input 3:Processing in reverse topological order (4, then 3, 2, 1).4 is in the closure. So, we need at least one of 2 or 3. But since both require 1, any choice would require 1 to be present. So, 1 must be present. Once 1 is present, 2 and 3 are added via forward implications, which adds 4 again.But how to model this in code.Perhaps we can model the necessary events by considering that for any event B in the closure, all events that are in all possible paths to B must be included.Alternatively, the necessary events are the events that are in the initial S&#39;s forward closure and the closure under the reverse implications.But again, how to model this.Let me think of the steps needed:1. Compute the forward closure of S. This is all events that are reachable via forward implications from S.But wait, no. Because forward implications are in the direction A→B. So if A is present, B must be present. So the forward closure is the set of all events that can be reached by starting from S and adding all events that are implied by events already in the closure.So, this step is straightforward: build the forward closure, which is all events that are implied by any event in the closure.This can be done using a BFS or DFS.Once we have the forward closure, we need to check for each event in this closure if all their predecessors (in the implication graph) are covered. If not, we need to add some predecessors.But which predecessors?But the note says that for any event in the closure, if there are predecessors (i.e., events that imply it), then at least one of them must be present. So, the initial forward closure may not satisfy this condition. For example, if the initial S is {4}, then the forward closure is {4}, but 4&#39;s predecessors are 2 and 3. So, the forward closure is invalid, but according to the note, it must be valid. Therefore, the initial S must be such that the forward closure is valid. But this contradicts sample input 2.Hmm, this suggests that my approach is incorrect.Alternatively, the process is that the initial S is valid, but the forward closure may not be, and thus we have to adjust it to meet the note&#39;s conditions.But how?Alternatively, the steps are:1. Start with the initial S.2. Compute the forward closure, adding all events implied by events in S.3. For each event in the closure, check if it has any predecessors in the implication graph. If so, ensure that at least one predecessor is present in the closure. If not, add all possible predecessors and repeat steps 2 and 3.But this seems like it could lead to an infinite loop, but since the graph is acyclic, perhaps it&#39;s manageable.But in sample input 3, after step 2, the closure is {4}. Then, step 3 checks that 4 has predecessors 2 and 3, but neither are in the closure. So, we need to add at least one of them. However, adding 2 requires adding 1 (since 2&#39;s only predecessor is 1), and adding 3 requires adding 1. So, regardless of which one is added, 1 must be added. Then, the forward closure would include 2 and 3 (from 1), which then imply 4. So, the closure must include 1, 2, 3, 4.But how to model this in code.Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to process the events in reverse topological order (from leaves to roots) and for each event, if it is required (i.e., in the closure), then all its predecessors must be added. But that&#39;s not correct. For example, in sample input 3, if 4 is required, then at least one of 2 or 3 is required, and each of those requires 1. So, 1 is required. Thus, the required events are 1, 2, 3, 4.So, processing in reverse topological order:- For 4: if it&#39;s required, then at least one of 2 or 3 is required.But since 2 and 3 are not in the initial forward closure, but once we determine that 4 is required, we need to require at least one of 2 or 3.But since 2 and 3 are each required to have 1 in their predecessors, adding either requires adding 1. Thus, 1 is required.So, the process is:For each event in reverse topological order (starting from the leaves):- If the event is required (either in the initial S or required by its successors), then we must add at least one of its predecessors.But how to model this.Alternatively, the required events can be determined by starting from the initial S and propagating required predecessors.But how.Another Idea:The problem is to find the minimal set of events that includes S and is closed under forward implications and such that for every event in the set, all of their required predecessors are also present (at least one per event).But this is not the case. The required set is not minimal, but the intersection of all possible valid closures.So, the output is the set of events that are present in every possible valid closure.To find this, we can model it as follows:An event X is in the output if and only if:- X is in the initial forward closure (i.e., implied by S via forward implications), or- X is required by the reverse implications of some event in the output.But again, how to model this.Alternative Plan:1. Compute the forward closure of S. Let&#39;s call this FC.2. For each event B in FC, check if there are any predecessors (events A where A → B).   a. If there are no predecessors, nothing to do.   b. If there are predecessors, but at least one is already in FC, nothing to do.   c. If there are predecessors, but none are in FC, then we must add all possible predecessors to the closure. But according to the note, at least one must be present. However, since we are looking for the events that are present in every possible closure, we need to add all predecessors that are common to all possible closures. For example, if a predecessor is required in all possible scenarios, it must be added.But how to find those.Alternatively, for event B in FC with predecessors P1, P2, ..., Pk:If none of the Pi are in FC, then in any valid closure, at least one Pi must be present. But which Pi&#39;s are present depends on the scenario. However, if there is a Pi that is required in all scenarios, then that Pi must be added to the output.For example, in sample input 3, event 4 has predecessors 2 and 3. Neither is in the FC. So, in any valid closure, at least one of 2 or 3 must be present. But each of these has predecessors. 2 has predecessor 1, and 3 has predecessor 1. So, in any scenario where 2 is present, 1 must be present, and similarly for 3. So, 1 must be present in all valid closures. Thus, 1 must be added to the output. Then, since 1 is present, 2 and 3 are added via forward closure, which adds 4 again.So, the algorithm would be:For each event B in FC:   If B has predecessors and none are in FC:       For each predecessor A of B:           If every path from A to B requires certain events to be present, then those events must be added.But this seems vague.Alternative Idea:The output is the union of the initial FC and the set of events that are required to satisfy the note&#39;s condition for all events in FC.So, the steps are:1. Compute FC (forward closure).2. For each event B in FC:   a. If B has no predecessors, do nothing.   b. Else, check if there exists any predecessor A of B that is in FC. If not, then we need to add all predecessors of B. Wait, but according to the note, at least one must be present. However, since we&#39;re looking for events that are present in all possible scenarios, we need to find the predecessors that are present in all possible scenarios. If there are multiple predecessors and they have different paths, then their common ancestors must be added.Alternatively, the algorithm can be structured as follows:For each event B in the initial FC:   If B has predecessors, then the intersection of all possible predecessors&#39; closure must be added.But how to compute this.Another Idea:The output must include all events that are in FC plus all events that are in the closure of any predecessor of any event in FC.But this seems like a recursive approach.Alternatively, think of it as a two-phase process:1. Compute the forward closure (FC) of S.2. Compute the mandatory predecessors for all events in FC. These are predecessors that are required in all possible valid closures.   For example, if an event B is in FC and all of its predecessors are part of a chain leading to a common event A, then A must be included.In sample input 3:For event 4, the predecessors are 2 and 3. Both of their predecessors are 1. So, 1 is mandatory.Thus, 1 must be included. Then, 1&#39;s forward closure includes 2 and 3, which include 4.So, the algorithm would:- Find all events B in FC that have predecessors not in FC.- For each such B, find the set of all possible predecessors (A such that A → B).- For each of these predecessors, find the mandatory events that must be present in any valid closure.But how to find mandatory events.Perhaps the mandatory events are those that are common ancestors of all possible predecessors.But this is getting too vague.Another Idea:We can model the problem by building two graphs: the original implication graph and the reverse graph.The reverse graph has edges B → A for each implication A → B.Then, for each event B in FC, if there are edges in the reverse graph (i.e., predecessors in the implication graph), then at least one of them must be present in the closure. So, the closure must include the union of FC and the set of predecessors required by these conditions.But how.Perhaps, we can find for each event B in FC, the set of all possible predecessors. If none are in FC, then we need to add all predecessors to the closure. But since the note requires that at least one must be present, but we can&#39;t know which, the only way to ensure that an event X is present in all closures is if every possible predecessor of B requires X to be present.For example, in sample input 3:The predecessors of 4 are 2 and 3. Each of their predecessors is 1. So, any predecessor of 4 must have 1 as a predecessor. So, 1 must be present in all closures. Hence, 1 must be added.Once 1 is added, its forward closure adds 2 and 3, which add 4.So, the algorithm would:- For each event B in FC:   - If B has predecessors and none are in FC:       - Find all predecessors of B in the implication graph.       - For each predecessor A of B:           - Compute the set of mandatory events that must be present in any closure that includes A.       - The intersection of all mandatory events across all possible predecessors of B must be added.But this is still not clear.Alternative Idea:The mandatory events are those that are required by all possible paths from the predecessors of events in FC.Thus, for each event B in FC with predecessors P1, P2, ..., Pk:If none of the Pi are in FC, then for each Pi, there is a set of events that must be present if Pi is in the closure. The intersection of all these sets across all Pi is the set of events that must be present regardless of which Pi is chosen.For example, in sample input 3, for event 4:Predecessors are 2 and 3. For each Pi (2 and 3):- If 2 is in the closure, then 1 must be present.- If 3 is in the closure, then 1 must be present.So the intersection is {1}, which must be added.Then, 1&#39;s forward closure adds 2 and 3.Thus, the algorithm would need to find for each event B in FC with no predecessors in FC:   The intersection of all mandatory events for each of B&#39;s predecessors.This suggests a recursive approach.But how to implement this efficiently.Another Idea:The problem can be viewed as a two-step process:1. Compute the forward closure of S (FC).2. For each event B in FC, if B has predecessors not in FC, then recursively process those predecessors to find events that must be in the closure.But this seems like a possible approach.For example:In sample input 3:FC is {4}.4 has predecessors 2 and 3 not in FC.So, we process each of them.For 2:Check if 2 is in FC (no). Then, 2 has predecessor 1.Process 1.1 is not in FC. Add 1 to a temporary set.Then, the forward closure of 1 is 2, 3, 4.But since we&#39;re only interested in events that must be present in all scenarios, adding 1&#39;s forward closure would add 2 and 3. But since in any scenario where 4 is present, either 2 or 3 must be present, which requires 1 to be present, the only way is to add 1.Once 1 is added, its forward closure includes 2 and 3, which then include 4.Thus, the output is the union of FC (4) and the mandatory events (1, 2, 3).So, the algorithm would:- Start with FC = S.- For each event in FC, check if it has predecessors.   For each predecessor not in FC:       recursively add the mandatory events for that predecessor.But how to implement this.Alternatively, we can model this as a dependency graph where each event&#39;s presence requires certain other events to be present.Thus, the code would:- Compute FC using BFS.- For each event in FC, collect all their predecessors.- For each predecessor not in FC, recursively process them to find events that must be added.But this could lead to a lot of redundant processing.Alternatively, we can model the mandatory events using a reverse approach.An event X must be in the output if X is in FC, or X is a mandatory predecessor of an event in the output.To compute mandatory predecessors:For each event B in the output, if B has predecessors, then there must be at least one predecessor in the output. So, the mandatory predecessors are all predecessors of B that are present in all possible valid closures.But how to compute this.This is getting too stuck. Perhaps looking for a solution pattern.The correct approach seems to be:1. Compute the forward closure of S. This gives all events that must be in the output due to forward implications.2. For each event in this forward closure, check if they have any predecessors. If they do, and none are in the forward closure, then those events&#39; mandatory predecessors must be added. This is a recursive process.But how to find mandatory predecessors.The key insight is that for event B in the forward closure, if none of its predecessors are present, then at least one predecessor must be added. But in order for that predecessor to be present, its own predecessors must be handled. This creates a chain until we reach an event with no predecessors.The mandatory events are those that must be present in all possible paths from the initial S to B.Thus, the correct approach is to:- Compute the forward closure.- For each event in the forward closure, collect all possible predecessors in the reverse implication graph.- For each event in the forward closure, if there are predecessors not in the forward closure, then their mandatory events must be added.This seems like a recursive process, but it&#39;s manageable.But the problem is to find the events that must be in the closure regardless of the choices made.The correct way to model this is to find the set of events that are in the forward closure plus the set of events that are required by the reverse implications, but only if they are required by all possible choices.Thus, the code can be structured as follows:1. Compute the forward closure (FC) of S.2. For each event B in FC, check if B has any predecessors. If yes, and none are in FC, then:   a. For each predecessor A of B, compute the minimal set of events that must be present if A is chosen. The intersection of these sets across all possible A&#39;s would be the mandatory events to add.   b. Add these mandatory events to the output.3. Repeat the process for the new events added.But how to compute the minimal set for each predecessor.Alternatively, for each event B in FC:   if B has predecessors and none are in FC:       find the intersection of all possible closure sets when choosing each predecessor.       add this intersection to the output.But again, this is not straightforward.Alternative Idea:The mandatory events are those that are in the intersection of all possible closure sets. For each event B in FC, the events that must be present are those that are required by all possible predecessors of B.For example, in sample input 3:B is 4. Predecessors are 2 and 3. For each predecessor:- If 2 is chosen, then 1 must be present.- If 3 is chosen, then 1 must be present.Thus, the intersection is {1}, which must be added.Once 1 is added, its forward closure is {1, 2, 3, 4}.Thus, the code can be structured to, for each event in FC that has predecessors not in FC:   find the common ancestors of all predecessors. These ancestors must be added.But how to find common ancestors.This seems like a problem of finding the common ancestors of all predecessors of B, and then adding them.But how to compute this.Alternatively, for each event B in FC:   if B has predecessors and none are in FC:       the mandatory events are those that are common to all possible predecessor paths of B.Thus, we can compute the common ancestors of all predecessors of B.But how to find this efficiently.Another Idea:We can model this as a dependency graph where each event must have at least one predecessor in the closure. The minimal set that includes the initial FC and all required predecessors can be found by processing the events in reverse topological order and adding necessary predecessors.Processing in reverse topological order ensures that when we process an event, all its predecessors have already been processed.For example:In reverse topological order (events with higher depth first):For each event B in FC:   if B has predecessors not in FC:       add all predecessors of B to a set.       for each predecessor A:           if A is not in FC:               add A to a new set, and compute their predecessors.But this seems like a loop.Alternatively, in reverse topological order:For each event B in reverse topological order:   if B is in FC and has no predecessors in FC:       for each predecessor A of B:           add A to FC.           add all events in the forward closure of A.But this would add all possible predecessors, which may not be required.But this approach would not work because it adds all possible predecessors, which may not be necessary.But perhaps this is the correct approach for the sample input.Alternatively, the correct approach is to find all events that are in FC or are required to be present in the closure due to the reverse implications.So, the code can be structured as follows:- Compute the forward closure (FC) using BFS.- For each event B in FC:   if B has predecessors:       if none of the predecessors are in FC:           then, all predecessors of B must be added to FC.           recompute FC after adding them.But this would cause an infinite loop in some cases.But how to handle this.Alternatively, after adding the predecessors, recompute the forward closure.But this is computationally expensive for large inputs.But given the constraints (D up to 1000, M up to 1e5), perhaps it&#39;s manageable.But this approach seems incorrect.Let me think of sample input 2:FC is {3}.3 has predecessors 1 and 2, which are not in FC. So, according to this approach, we need to add both 1 and 2 to FC.But the note says that at least one must be present. So, adding both is incorrect. But since we are looking for the intersection of all possible closures, adding both would be incorrect. So, this approach is not correct.Thus, this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect.So, perhaps the correct way to model this problem is to realize that the set of events that must be present is the closure of S under forward implications and under the reverse implications&#39; mandatory conditions.But how to compute this.After extensive thinking, I think the correct approach is as follows:The set of events that must be present is the union of S&#39;s forward closure and the closure of all events that are mandatory predecessors for each event in the forward closure.But how to compute this.Let me consider the following steps:1. Compute the forward closure of S. Let&#39;s call this F.2. For each event B in F:   if B has predecessors (A implies B), then at least one of the predecessors must be present. If none are present in F, then the mandatory predecessors must be added. This process continues until all events in the closure have their predecessors satisfied.But how.This seems like a problem of finding the minimal set that includes F and satisfies the reverse implication constraints.This can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem. The constraints are:For each B in the closure:   if there exists an implication A → B, then at least one A is in the closure.The initial closure is F, and we need to find the minimal superset of F that satisfies all constraints.But the minimal superset may not be unique. However, the problem requires finding the intersection of all possible minimal closures.But how to compute this.Alternatively, the problem requires finding all events that are present in every possible valid closure.Thus, the events in the output are those events that are in F, plus all events that are required by the reverse implications for every event in F.The algorithm to compute this is:1. Compute F, the forward closure of S.2. For each event B in F, in reverse topological order (processing B after all events that can be implied by B are processed):   a. If B has no predecessors, continue.   b. Check if there exists any predecessor of B in F.   c. If not, then all predecessors of B must be added to the closure.   d. For each predecessor A added:       i. Add A to F.       ii. Add all events implied by A to F (forward closure again).But this approach would add all predecessors, which is not correct in cases where there are multiple predecessors.But in sample input 2, this would add both 1 and 2, which is incorrect. The sample output is {3}, but according to this approach, both 1 and 2 would be added, which is wrong.Thus, this approach is incorrect.Alternative Idea:The correct way is to realize that the mandatory events are those that are in every possible valid closure. So, for an event X to be mandatory, there is no valid closure that excludes X.Thus, X is in the output if:- X is in the initial forward closure, or- X is a predecessor of an event Y in the output, and every valid closure of Y requires X.So, this can be modeled as:For each event B in the closure:   if B&#39;s predecessors are all mandatory, then any predecessor is also mandatory.But how to compute this.Perhaps the way to do this is to process the events in reverse topological order (from leaves to roots). For each event B:   if B is in the closure (i.e., in the output), and all of B&#39;s predecessors are mandatory, then the intersection of the predecessors&#39; mandatory sets is added to the closure.But this is not clear.After trying multiple approaches and not finding a clear path, I think I need to look for a different way to model this problem.Another Idea: The set of events that must be present is the union of the forward closure and the backward closure of the minimal required predecessors.For example:The forward closure is F = all events implied by S.The backward closure is B = all events that are required to be present to satisfy the reverse implications.The B is computed as follows:For each event B in F:   if B has predecessors and none are in F, then add the mandatory predecessors of B to B.The mandatory predecessors are those events that must be present in any valid closure.For example, in sample input 3:B=4 is in F. Its predecessors are 2 and 3. Neither are in F. So, the mandatory predecessors of 4 are 1, since both 2 and 3 require 1.Thus, B includes 1. Then, the forward closure of 1 includes 2, 3, 4.Thus, the output is F ∪ B&#39;s closure.But how to compute this.Another Idea:The process is to compute the closure by iteratively adding events that are required by the reverse implications.Here&#39;s the algorithm:1. Compute F, the forward closure of S.2. For each event B in F:   a. If B has no predecessors, continue.   b. Else, check if any predecessor is present in F. If yes, continue.   c. Else, add all predecessors of B to a set P.3. For each event in P, compute the forward closure again.4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no new events are added.But this approach would add all predecessors of B, which may not be necessary. For example, in sample input 2, adding both 1 and 2.But sample input 2&#39;s output is {3}, so this approach would be incorrect.Thus, this approach is incorrect.At this point, I think I need to look for a different approach.Researching the problem, it seems like this is a problem involving the concept of &quot;necessary nodes&quot; in a DAG, considering both forward and reverse implications.Upon further thought, the problem can be viewed as finding the minimal set of nodes that contains S, is closed under forward implications, and is closed under the reverse implications (i.e., if a node is present, then at least one of its parents is present). The output is the set of nodes that are in every possible such minimal set.But how to find this.The answer lies in the fact that the necessary nodes are those that are in the forward closure and any node that is a common ancestor of all possible parents of nodes in the forward closure.This suggests that the solution involves:1. Compute the forward closure F.2. For each node in F, compute the set of all possible parents.3. For each such node, the intersection of the ancestors of all possible parents must be added to the closure.But how to compute this.Alternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows:The output is the set of all events that are in F or are required to be present in all possible valid closures.To find these required events:For each event B in F:   if B has parents and none are in F:       the required events are the common ancestors of all possible parents of B.Thus, for each B in F:   parents = all A where A → B.   if parents is not empty and none are in F:       for each parent in parents:           compute the set of all ancestors of the parent.       the required events are the intersection of all these ancestor sets.       add these required events to the output.Then, compute the forward closure of these required events and add them to F.But this seems computationally expensive.But for small D (up to 1000), this could be feasible.In sample input 3:For B=4, parents are 2 and 3. Neither are in F (F={4}).For parent 2: ancestors are 1.For parent 3: ancestors are 1.The intersection is {1}. So, add 1 to the output.Then, compute the forward closure of 1, which adds 2, 3, 4.Thus, the output is {1,2,3,4}.In sample input 2:For B=3, parents are 1 and 2. Neither are in F.For parent 1: ancestors are 1.For parent 2: ancestors are 2.The intersection is empty. So, no required events are added. Thus, the output remains {3}.This matches the sample input 2.Thus, the correct approach is:For each event B in the initial forward closure F:   if B has parents not in F:       compute the intersection of the ancestor sets of all parents of B.       add these events to the output.Then, compute the forward closure of these added events and repeat the process until no new events are added.Thus, the steps are:1. Compute F, the forward closure of S.2. For each B in F:   if B has parents and none of the parents are in F:       compute the intersection of all ancestor sets of B&#39;s parents.       add the events in this intersection to a set R.3. Compute the forward closure of R, add to F.4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no new events are added.But how to compute the ancestor sets and their intersection.This seems manageable.Implementation Steps:1. Build the forward implication graph (adjacency list).2. Build the reverse implication graph (adjacency list) for parents.3. Compute the forward closure F using BFS from S.4. For each B in F:   a. Get all parents of B from the reverse graph.   b. If no parents, continue.   c. Check if any parent is in F. If yes, continue.   d. Else, collect all parents and compute the common ancestors.5. To compute the common ancestors of all parents:   a. For each parent, compute all of its ancestors (including itself) via BFS.   b. Take the intersection of all ancestor sets.6. Add the intersection to R.7. Compute the forward closure of R and add to F.8. Repeat steps 4-7 until no new events are added.This process would correctly compute the required events.Now, let&#39;s see how this applies to sample input 3.Sample Input 3:D=4, M=3, N=1.Implications:1→21→32→43→4Initial S: {4}Forward closure F: {4}.Step 4:B=4.Parents are 2 and 3. Neither are in F.For each parent:Parent 2: ancestors are 2, 1.Parent 3: ancestors are 3, 1.Intersection is {1}.Add 1 to R.Compute forward closure of {1}, which is {1,2,3,4}.Add these to F.Now F becomes {1,2,3,4}.Step 4 again:For each B in F:B=1: parents are none. Continue.B=2: parents is 1. 1 is in F. Continue.B=3: parents is 1. 1 is in F. Continue.B=4: parents are 2 and 3, both in F. Continue.Thus, no more additions. Output is sorted F.Which is {1,2,3,4}.Sample Input 2:D=3, M=2, N=1.Implications:1→3, 2→3.Initial S: {3}.Forward closure F: {3}.Step 4:B=3.Parents are 1 and 2. Neither in F.For each parent:Parent 1&#39;s ancestors: {1}.Parent 2&#39;s ancestors: {2}.Intersection is empty.Thus, R is empty.No new events added. Output is {3}.Thus, this approach works.Thus, the plan is:- Compute forward closure.- For each event in forward closure, check if any of its parents are present. If not, compute the intersection of all ancestor sets of parents and add those events.- Repeat until no new events are added.Now, the code.First, we need to represent the forward and reverse graphs.Then, compute the forward closure.For each event in the forward closure, check if any of its parents are present. If not, compute the intersection of the ancestors of all parents.The ancestors of a parent are all events that can reach the parent via the forward implication graph (since if you have A → B, then A is a predecessor of B).Wait, no. Wait, the reverse graph is parents (i.e., A → B implies B&#39;s parents include A).But the ancestors of a parent A would be all events that can reach A via the reverse implication graph. Wait, no. The reverse implication graph is for parents. So, to find the ancestors of A in the reverse graph, it&#39;s all events that can reach A via parent relationships. For example, if there is C → A, then C is a parent of A, and so on.But this is the same as the original implication graph&#39;s forward direction. Because the reverse implication graph&#39;s parents are the original implication&#39;s children.Thus, the ancestor of a parent A in the reverse implication graph would be all events that can be used to imply A via the original implications.For example, in sample input 3:The reverse implication graph for B=4&#39;s parents is 2 and 3. The ancestor sets for 2 in the reverse graph are 1 and 2. For 3, 1 and 3.Thus, the intersection is {1}.So, to compute the ancestors of a parent A, we need to compute all events that can reach A via the original implication graph.Because the original implication graph is A → B. So, for event A, all events that can reach A via the implication graph are the ancestors of A.Thus, the ancestors of A are all events in the original implication graph that can reach A via forward implications.Wait, no. If the original implication is A → B, then B is implied by A. So, the ancestors of B in the original implication graph are all events that can imply B, including A and any events that imply A.But in the reverse implication graph, the parents of B are the events that directly imply B (like A).Thus, to find all events that can imply a parent A (i.e., the events that can reach A via the original implication graph), we need to build the reverse of the original implication graph and compute the reachable nodes from A.Wait, no. The original implication graph is A → B. So, the original graph is a directed graph where edges go from cause to effect. So, the ancestors of B in this graph are all events that can cause B via implications.Thus, for parent A (which is a cause of B), the ancestors of A are all events that can cause A.So, to compute the ancestors of A, we can build a reverse graph where edges are from B to A for each implication A → B. Then, the ancestors of A in the original graph are all nodes that can reach A in this reverse graph.Thus, for each event, we can precompute its ancestors (events that can imply it).This can be done using BFS or DFS for each event.But since D can be up to 1000, and M up to 1e5, precomputing ancestors for each event is feasible.Once we have the ancestors for each event, then for each B in the forward closure F, if none of its parents are in F, we collect all the parents, compute the intersection of their ancestor sets (including themselves), and add those events to R.Then, the forward closure of R is added to F.This process is repeated until no new events are added.Thus, the steps are:1. Build the original implication graph (adjacency list for forward implications).2. Build the reverse implication graph (adjacency list for parents).3. For each event, compute its ancestors in the original graph (i.e., all events that can imply it).4. Compute the forward closure F of the initial S using BFS.5. While true:   a. For each B in F:       i. Get parents from the reverse graph.       ii. If parents is empty, continue.       iii. Check if any parent is in F. If yes, continue.       iv. Else, collect all parents.   b. For all collected parents, compute the intersection of their ancestor sets.   c. If the intersection is empty, break.   d. Compute the forward closure of the intersection, add to F.   e. If no new events are added, break.6. Output F sorted.Thus, the code can be implemented as follows.Now, let&#39;s proceed to code.We need to:- Read D, M, N.- Read M implications.- Build the forward graph and reverse graph.- Precompute ancestors for each event.- Read N initial events into S.- Compute initial F as the forward closure of S.- Iterate:   For each B in F, check parents. If no parents in F, collect parents.   For collected parents, compute the intersection of their ancestor sets.   If intersection is empty, break.   Else, compute forward closure of intersection, add to F.- Repeat until no new events are added.Now, code:First, read the input.Then, build the forward and reverse graphs.Precompute ancestors for each node.Compute forward closure.Then, the loop.To compute the ancestors for each node, we can perform a BFS for each node.But for D=1000, this would be O(D*(D+M)) which is acceptable for the constraints.Then, the intersection of ancestor sets for multiple parents.For example, for parents P1, P2, ..., Pk:For each Pi, the ancestor set is a set of nodes. The intersection is the common nodes in all these sets.Once we have the intersection, we compute their forward closure and add to F.Repeat this process.Let&#39;s see for sample input 3:Initial F = {4}Parents of 4: 2,3.None are in F.Ancestors of 2: 1,2.Ancestors of 3: 1,3.Intersection: {1}Forward closure of {1} is {1,2,3,4}.Add to F: {1,2,3,4}.Next iteration:Check all events in F.For 1: parents are none.For 2: parent 1 (in F).For 3: parent 1 (in F).For4: parents 2 and 3 (in F).No more parents to process.Break.Output sorted.Thus, the code works.Now, code:Read D, M, N.Build the forward graph and reverse graph.For each event from 1 to D:   Compute ancestors via BFS.Read initial S.Compute forward closure of S.Now, loop:   collect parents of all B in F that have parents not in F.   for each such B, collect all parents.   if no parents, break.   compute the intersection of ancestors of all collected parents.   if intersection is empty, break.   compute the forward closure of intersection.   add to F if not already present.   if no new events added, break.Else, repeat.But wait, in code, how to collect the parents?Let&#39;s code it step by step.Implementing in Python:Read D, M, N.forward = [[] for _ in range(D+1)]reverse = [[] for _ in range(D+1)]for _ in range(M):    A, B = map(int, input().split())    forward[A].append(B)    reverse[B].append(A)# Precompute ancestors for each node.ancestors = [set() for _ in range(D+1)]for node in range(1, D+1):    visited = set()    stack = [node]    visited.add(node)    while stack:        u = stack.pop()        for v in reverse[u]:            if v not in visited:                visited.add(v)                stack.append(v)    ancestors[node] = visited# Read initial S.S = set()for _ in range(N):    X = int(input())    S.add(X)# Compute forward closure of S.current_F = set(S)queue = list(S)visited = set(queue)while queue:    u = queue.pop(0)    for v in forward[u]:        if v not in visited:            visited.add(v)            current_F.add(v)            queue.append(v)current_F = visited# Now, loop.added = Truewhile added:    added = False    # Collect parents of B not in current_F.    parents_to_consider = set()    for B in current_F:        # Get parents of B.        parents = reverse[B]        if not parents:            continue        # Check if any parent is in current_F.        any_in_F = any(p in current_F for p in parents)        if not any_in_F:            # Add all parents to parents_to_consider.            parents_to_consider.update(parents)    if not parents_to_consider:        break    # Compute intersection of ancestors of all parents in parents_to_consider.    if not parents_to_consider:        intersection = set()    else:        intersection = None        for p in parents_to_consider:            if intersection is None:                intersection = ancestors[p].copy()            else:                intersection.intersection_update(ancestors[p])            if not intersection:                break    if not intersection:        break    # Compute forward closure of intersection.    new_nodes = set()    queue = list(intersection)    new_visited = set(queue)    for node in queue:        if node not in current_F:            new_nodes.add(node)        current_F.add(node)        for v in forward[node]:            if v not in new_visited:                new_visited.add(v)                queue.append(v)    # Update current_F.    current_F.update(new_visited)    if new_nodes:        added = True# Once no more additions, output sorted current_F.print(&#39; &#39;.join(map(str, sorted(current_F))))Wait, but this code has some issues. For example, in the loop where we process parents_to_consider, the code may not properly compute the intersection.Let&#39;s test with sample input 3.Parents_to_consider after initial F {4} is {2, 3}.Ancestors of 2: {1,2}.Ancestors of 3: {1,3}.Intersection is {1}.So, intersection is {1}.Then, compute forward closure of {1} which adds 1, 2, 3, 4.These are added to current_F.The code should work.Another test case: sample input 2.Parents_to_consider after initial F {3} is {1, 2}.Ancestors of 1: {1}.Ancestors of 2: {2}.Intersection is empty.So, break.Output is {3}.Thus, the code works.Another test case: sample input 1.Sample Input 1:3 2 11 22 32Initial S is {2}.Forward closure is {2,3}.Parents of 2: 1.Check if 1 is in F (no). So, parents_to_consider is {1}.Ancestors of 1: {1}.Intersection is {1}.Compute forward closure of {1} → {1, 2,3}.Add to current_F → {1,2,3}.Then, loop again:Check parents of all events in F.For 1: no parents.For 2: parent is 1 (in F).For 3: parent is 2 (in F).No parents to consider. Break.Output is {1,2,3}.Thus, the code works.Thus, this code should handle all cases correctly.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine all events that must have certainly occurred based on given implications and initial evidence. The solution involves computing the closure of events under both forward implications and reverse dependencies to ensure all necessary events are included. Approach1. Forward Closure: Start with the initial set of events and compute all events that must occur due to forward implications.2. Reverse Dependencies: For each event in the forward closure, ensure that all necessary predecessors (events that imply it) are included.

Reading Input: The input is read and parsed into the number of events, implications, and initial events.2. Graph Construction: Two graphs are constructed: one for forward implications and one for reverse implications.3. Ancestor Precomputation: For each event, all ancestors (events that can imply it) are precomputed using BFS on the reverse graph.4. Forward Closure: The initial set of events is expanded using BFS to include all events implied by forward implications.5. Reverse Dependencies Handling: For each event in the forward closure, if it has no predecessors in the closure, the intersection of all possible predecessors&#39; ancestors is computed. The forward closure of this intersection is added to the current set of events, ensuring all necessary predecessors are included.6. Output: The final set of events is sorted and printed.This approach ensures that all events that must have occurred, considering both forward and reverse implications, are included in the solution.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ef989c89 data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review" data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review-title" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>❓:</span>Read problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well. Chef and his little brother are playing with sticks. Initially, Chef has N sticks with lengths A_{1}, A_{2}, dots, A_{N}. He should give his little brother at least K of these sticks. Afterwards, Chef&#39;s brother should choose four sticks and use them to form a rectangle (a square is also a rectangle). Chef does not want his brother to break any of the sticks, so each of the chosen sticks should be one side of the rectangle.Chef&#39;s little brother wants the rectangle he makes to have the maximum possible area, while Chef wants it to have the minimum possible area. Therefore, Chef wants to choose the sticks to give his brother in such a way that they cannot be used to form a rectangle; if it&#39;s impossible, then he wants to choose the sticks in such a way that the maximum area of a rectangle his little brother can form is minimum possible.Can you find the area of the resulting rectangle (or determine that it won&#39;t be possible to form any) if both Chef and his little brother play optimally?------  Input ------The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The problem is a bit tricky. So Chef has to give his brother at least K sticks. But after that, the brother will choose four sticks to form a rectangle. The area is the product of two pairs of equal lengths. Chef wants to choose the sticks he gives in such a way that either the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle (in which case output -1), or if that&#39;s impossible, then the maximum possible area the brother can make is as small as possible. Our task is to find the resulting area after both play optimally.Hmm. So the key here is to model the optimal strategies of both Chef and his brother.First, let&#39;s understand the steps. For each test case:1. Chef selects a subset of sticks S, where the size of S is at least K.2. The brother then tries to choose four sticks from S to form a rectangle. He picks the best possible to maximize the area.3. Chef&#39;s goal is to choose S such that either the brother can&#39;t form any rectangle (output -1), or if not possible, minimize the maximum area the brother can get.So, Chef wants to minimize the possible maximum area, and the brother will maximize it given S. So Chef has to choose S (with size ≥K) in a way that the best possible rectangle in S is as small as possible. But if Chef can choose S such that there&#39;s no possible rectangle, then he will do that, leading to -1.The problem is to find, after Chef&#39;s optimal choice, what the brother can do.So first, for each test case, we need to determine all possible subsets S of the given sticks, with size ≥K. Then, among all possible S&#39;s that Chef can choose, find the one that either makes it impossible for the brother (so S has no possible rectangle), or the minimal maximum possible area.But considering that the input sizes are up to 1e5, we need an efficient approach. Enumerating all possible subsets is impossible.So the approach must involve some analysis of the frequency of the stick lengths.Let me think: to form a rectangle, you need at least two pairs of equal lengths. So the brother needs two pairs (they can be four of the same length, but that&#39;s two pairs). So the problem reduces to finding pairs of sticks. For each possible length, count how many times it appears. Then, the possible pairs are when a length has at least two occurrences. The brother will choose the two largest possible pairs (i.e., two largest distinct lengths with at least two occurrences each, or a single length with four or more occurrences) and multiply them to get the maximum area.But Chef is trying to select a subset S such that either there are no such pairs, or the maximum possible product is minimized.So the problem is about which lengths to include or exclude in S, such that when the brother selects the best pairs, the product is as small as possible. But Chef can&#39;t exclude all pairs, but sometimes he might have to.Wait, but Chef gives at least K sticks. So, the first step is to select a subset S with size ≥K. Then, in S, the brother will look for the maximum possible product.Chef&#39;s strategy is to choose S (from the possible subsets) that either makes it impossible for the brother to form a rectangle (so in S, there are no two pairs), or if that&#39;s impossible, choose S such that the maximum possible product of pairs is minimized.So the problem can be broken down into two parts:1. Can Chef select a subset S of size ≥K such that in S, there are no two pairs (so the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle)? If yes, then output -1.2. If it&#39;s impossible for Chef to prevent the brother from forming a rectangle (i.e., every subset S of size ≥K allows at least two pairs), then find the minimal possible maximum area that the brother can achieve.So first, we need to check whether there exists a subset S of size ≥K where the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. If such a subset exists, Chef will choose it, so the answer is -1. Otherwise, find the minimal possible maximum area.Wait, but how do we check if such a subset exists?To prevent the brother from forming a rectangle, S must not have at least two pairs. So, in S:- All lengths occur at most once. Then no pairs. But that&#39;s impossible if S has at least two elements. Because then you need two pairs. Wait, no: the brother needs four sticks to form a rectangle. So S needs to have at least four sticks. If all sticks in S are unique, then the brother can&#39;t form any pairs, so can&#39;t make a rectangle. But if S has size &gt;=4 but all sticks are unique, then the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So in that case, output is -1.But if the subset S has size &gt;=4, but all sticks are unique, then the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So Chef can choose such a subset to give to his brother, and the output is -1.But wait, Chef can only give S if the size is &gt;= K. So, for example, if K is 6, and the subset must be at least 6 in size. Then Chef needs to select a subset S of size &gt;=6, and all elements in S are unique. So if such a subset exists, output -1.Alternatively, if even when selecting a subset S of size K, all elements are unique, then the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. But how can we check that?So the approach here is: first, find the maximum possible number of unique elements in the array. Then, if there exists a subset S of size &gt;=K where all elements are unique (so the count of each element in S is at most 1), then Chef can choose such a subset, leading to output -1.Wait, but that&#39;s not entirely correct. For example, if the original array has multiple duplicates, but Chef can choose a subset where all are unique, even if the original array has duplicates.So the first thing to check is: what is the maximum possible number of unique sticks in any subset S of size &gt;= K. Let&#39;s denote the number of unique elements in the array as U. Then, if U &gt;= K, Chef can select K unique sticks (if possible). So for example, if the array has 5 unique elements and K is 4, then Chef can select 4 unique elements. But if the array has duplicates but the maximum number of unique elements possible is U, then the maximum possible unique subset is U.Wait, maybe the maximum possible unique subset is min(U, the total number of elements, but arranged such that each is taken once). So to have a subset S of size &gt;= K, and S has all unique elements. The maximum possible size of S with all unique elements is U. So if U &gt;= K, then Chef can choose S as any K unique elements, leading to a subset where all elements are unique (so no two pairs, hence no possible rectangle). So in this case, the output is -1.But wait, if K is 5, and U is 5, then S has 5 elements, all unique. The brother needs four to form a rectangle. But since all are unique, he can&#39;t. So the output is -1.But wait, the problem states that the brother has to choose four sticks. So if S has 4 elements, all unique, then the brother can&#39;t form any rectangle. So if Chef can select a subset S of size &gt;=K (but S has size exactly K, which is &gt;=4?), then depending on the elements in S.Wait, perhaps the key here is whether Chef can choose a subset S with size &gt;=K, such that in S, there are not four sticks that form two pairs.So the conditions for Chef to output -1 are:There exists a subset S of size &gt;=K such that S has no four sticks that can form a rectangle.So to form a rectangle, you need at least two pairs (each pair has at least two sticks of the same length). So in S, there are no two pairs. That can happen in two cases:1. S has no pairs (i.e., all elements in S are unique). Then, no possible pairs. So the brother can&#39;t form any rectangle. But for that, S&#39;s size must be &gt;=4 (since brother needs four sticks). Wait, no: if S&#39;s size is 4 and all are unique, then the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. But if S&#39;s size is 3, then he can&#39;t form a rectangle either. But Chef gives S with size &gt;=K. So if K is 4, then S is exactly 4, and all unique, then brother can&#39;t form rectangle. But if K is 3, then S can be 4 elements (if possible) which are unique. Wait, but K is the minimum that Chef can give. So Chef can choose to give exactly K sticks, or more. But if Chef gives more, then he has to choose the subset S such that even if it&#39;s larger than K, it&#39;s structured in a way that brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.But how can S be larger than K and still have all unique elements? Because the original array may have duplicates. For example, if the array has 5 elements, all unique. Then S can be 5 elements (all unique). Then, brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So in that case, if K is 4, Chef can choose to give all 5 elements. So in that case, output is -1.So the first step is to check if there exists a subset S of size &gt;=K where:- The subset S can&#39;t form a rectangle (i.e., in S, there are not two pairs of equal lengths). How can we model this?Alternatively, the minimal condition for S to not form a rectangle is that either:- There are fewer than 4 elements (but K could be up to N, so if K &lt;=3 and N &gt;= K, but then S would be of size &gt;=K. But if K &lt;=3, then the brother can&#39;t choose four sticks. So in this case, the output is -1. Wait, that&#39;s another possibility. For example, if K is 3 and Chef gives exactly 3 sticks. Then the brother can&#39;t choose four, so output -1.Wait, this is a crucial point. The problem says that the brother must choose four sticks. So if the subset S has less than four sticks, then he can&#39;t form a rectangle. So, if K is such that Chef can give a subset S with size &gt;=K and S&#39;s size is less than 4, then the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So the output is -1.So the first scenario where the output is -1 is when Chef can give a subset S with size &gt;=K, and the size of S is less than 4. Because the brother can&#39;t choose four sticks. So, for example, if K is 3, then Chef can choose to give 3 sticks (since 3 &gt;= K). Then, the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output is -1.Wait, that&#39;s correct. Because in this case, the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle regardless of the sticks. So Chef can just choose S with size exactly K (3), and the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output is -1.So the first condition to check is:If K &lt;= (the maximum possible subset size that is less than 4). Wait, no. Wait, if Chef can give a subset S with size &gt;=K and size(S) &lt;4, then the output is -1.But the size of S must be at least K, and also less than 4.So for example, if K is 3, then the subset S can be 3 (since 3 &gt;=3). The size of S is 3, which is less than 4. So the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output is -1.So the first case is: if K &lt;=3, and there exists a subset S with size &gt;=K (i.e., the total number of sticks N &gt;=K), then Chef can choose S of size exactly K. Since K &lt;=3, and S&#39;s size is K, then S&#39;s size is &lt;=3. So the brother can&#39;t choose four sticks. So the output is -1.Wait, but in that case, the sample input 1 has K=6. So that&#39;s not covered here.So in code, the first check is: if after giving at least K sticks, the subset&#39;s size can be &gt;=K and less than 4. Which is possible only if K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K.Wait, for example, K=3. Then the subset can be 3 elements. So size is 3 &lt;4. So output is -1.So the first step is:If K &lt;=3, and the number of sticks N &gt;=K, then Chef can choose a subset S of size exactly K. Then, the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So the output is -1.But wait, that&#39;s not entirely correct. Because suppose K is 3 and N is 5. Then Chef can choose a subset of size 3. Then, brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output is -1.So this is a case where the output is -1 regardless of the sticks.But wait, what if K is 4 and the subset S has 4 elements, but all unique. Then brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So the first condition is:Check if there&#39;s a subset S with size &gt;=K, and either:a) the size of S is less than 4 (i.e., K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K), leading to output -1.ORb) the size of S is &gt;=4, but all elements in S are unique (so the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle). For this to be possible, the maximum number of unique elements (U) in the array must be &gt;=max(K,4). Because if Chef can choose S with U elements, which is &gt;=K and &gt;=4 (since S needs to have at least 4 elements for brother to have a chance, but if all are unique, then even with 4 elements, he can&#39;t form a rectangle). Wait, if S is exactly 4 elements, all unique, then brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So the second condition is:If the number of unique elements in the array (U) is &gt;= max(K,4), then Chef can choose a subset of S with exactly max(K,4) elements (all unique). So the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle, output -1.So combining these:The output is -1 in two cases:1. If K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K. Because Chef can give exactly K sticks (size S=K &lt;4, so brother can&#39;t choose four sticks).2. Or, if the number of unique elements U is &gt;=max(K,4). Because Chef can choose S with max(K,4) unique elements (assuming that U is sufficient), which would be a subset of size &gt;=4 (if K &gt;=4) or exactly K (if K&lt;=3 and U &gt;=K). Wait, no. If K is 5 and U is 5. Then Chef can choose 5 elements (all unique) which is &gt;=K, and the subset size is 5. The brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So the condition for case 2 is: U &gt;= s, where s is the maximum between K and 4. Wait, perhaps not. For example, if K is 6, but U is 5. Then s would be 6, but U is 5 &lt;6. So Chef can&#39;t choose 6 unique elements. But maybe he can choose 5 elements (all unique), but that&#39;s less than K. So no.So the correct condition is that U &gt;= required size. The required size is the minimum possible subset size that satisfies the constraints (&gt;=K and &gt;=4 if needed for brother&#39;s requirement). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.Case 2: Chef wants to select a subset S of size &gt;=K, and all elements in S are unique. The maximum possible size of such S is U (since there are U unique elements in the array). So if U &gt;= K, then Chef can select a subset of size K (since K &lt;=U) where all elements are unique. But then, the size of S is K. Then, if K &gt;=4, then brother can&#39;t form a rectangle (since all are unique). So in that case, output -1.But if K=5 and U=5, then the subset has 5 elements, all unique. So brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output is -1.So the condition for case 2 is U &gt;= K and (the subset S is of size K, which is &gt;=4 if K &gt;=4). So if K &gt;=4 and U &gt;=K, then Chef can choose S of size K, all unique. Then brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output is -1.But what if K=3 and U=5? Then Chef can choose a subset S of size 3 (all unique), which is &gt;=K. Since 3&lt;4, brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So combining the two cases:The output is -1 if either:- K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K (since Chef can choose a subset of size K, which is less than 4, so brother can&#39;t form a rectangle).OR- The number of unique elements U is &gt;=max(K,4). Because Chef can choose a subset S of size max(K,4) (since U &gt;=max(K,4)), which would be &gt;=K. For example, if K is 5 and U is 6, then Chef can choose 5 elements (all unique). Then subset size is 5 &gt;=5, and all unique. So brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output -1.Wait, no. The subset size would be K, which is 5. So if Chef can choose 5 unique elements, then yes. So the condition is U &gt;= K. Because if K &gt;=4, and U &gt;= K, then S can be of size K (all unique). Then the subset size is K &gt;=4, but all elements are unique. So brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So the two cases where output is -1 are:Case 1: K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K (so Chef can choose a subset of size K, which is less than 4, leading to no rectangle).Case 2: U &gt;= K and K &gt;=4 (since the subset size is K &gt;=4, all unique elements, so no pairs. Brother can&#39;t form a rectangle).Wait, but what if U is 5 and K is 6. Then U is 5 &lt;6. So Chef can&#39;t choose 6 unique elements. So case 2 doesn&#39;t apply.So the correct conditions are:If the maximum possible subset size S with all unique elements is &gt;=K, then output is -1.But the maximum possible subset size with all unique elements is U. So:If (U &gt;= K and (U &gt;=4 or K &lt;=3)), then Chef can choose a subset S of size K (all unique elements). Then:- If K &lt;=3, then the subset size is K, which is &lt;=3. Brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.- If K &gt;=4 and U &gt;=K, then subset size is K &gt;=4, but all elements are unique, so brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So combining this, the condition for output -1 is:If (U &gt;= K) and (K &lt;=3 OR (K &gt;=4 and U &gt;=4)).Wait, but if K &gt;=4 and U &gt;=K, then U &gt;=4 (since K &gt;=4). So the condition is U &gt;= K. Because if U &gt;= K, then:- If K &lt;=3, then Chef can choose K unique elements (as U &gt;= K), leading to subset size K &lt;=3. Brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.- If K &gt;=4, then subset size is K &gt;=4. But all elements are unique. So brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So overall, the condition is: if U &gt;= K, then output is -1.Wait, but let&#39;s test some examples.Sample Input 2:5 4Sticks: 1 2 1 2 3 → U=3 (elements 1,2,3).K=4. So U=3 &lt;4. So condition U &gt;=K is false. So case 2 doesn&#39;t apply. But K is 4 &gt;=4. So Chef can&#39;t select 4 unique elements (since U=3). So he has to give at least 4 sticks, but can&#39;t have all unique. So in the sample input 2, the output is -1. But according to the sample output, the answer is -1. Wait, no.Wait sample input 2&#39;s output is -1. Let&#39;s see:Sample Input 2:5 4 → N=5, K=4.Sticks: [1,2,1,2,3]So the array has 3 unique elements (1,2,3). So U=3.K=4. So the condition U &gt;= K is 3 &gt;=4 → no. So case 2 doesn&#39;t apply.But K=4. So Chef has to give at least 4 sticks. What&#39;s the maximum subset with unique elements? 3. But 3 &lt;4. So Chef can&#39;t select a subset of size 4 with all unique. So he must give at least 4 sticks, but in any subset of 4, there must be duplicates.So the brother can form a rectangle. So Chef has to select a subset S of size &gt;=4 where the maximum possible rectangle area is minimized.Wait but sample output 2 is -1. Wait the explanation says that Chef can give his brother sticks [2,1,2,3], which has lengths 2,1,2,3. So two 2s and one 1 and 3. So here, there are two 2s. So brother can take two 2s and two 1s? Wait no, because the subset given is [2,1,2,3]. So the brother has two 2s, but only one 1. So he can&#39;t form two pairs. So the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.Ah, right! So Chef can choose a subset of 4 sticks where there are two pairs. Wait, no. Wait in the sample input 2&#39;s explanation, Chef gives sticks 2,1,2,3. So the counts are: 2 appears twice, 1 once, 3 once. So two 2s. So brother can take the two 2s and then needs another pair, but there&#39;s only one 1 and one 3. So he can&#39;t form another pair. So no possible rectangle. So output is -1.But according to our previous analysis, the condition U &gt;= K (3 &gt;=4) is false. So why is the output -1?Ah, because our previous analysis was missing another case where Chef can select a subset S where there are pairs, but not enough to form a rectangle.Wait, this is a third case. Chef can select a subset S where there exists pairs but not enough to form two distinct pairs (or four same).So for example, in sample input 2, Chef gives two 2s, one 1, one 3. So there&#39;s one pair (2,2). But to form a rectangle, you need two pairs. So the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So the output is -1.So our previous conditions are incomplete. Because even if the subset S contains duplicates, but not enough to form two pairs, then the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So the problem is more complex than initially thought.So the correct approach is:Chef wants to select a subset S of size &gt;=K such that in S, there are no two pairs. To form two pairs, we need either:- Two distinct lengths, each with at least two sticks.OR- One length with at least four sticks (so two pairs from the same length).So Chef&#39;s goal is to select S such that:In S, there is no pair of distinct lengths each with at least two sticks, and no length with at least four sticks.So, how can Chef select such a subset?This requires considering the frequencies of each length in the subset S.So Chef can:- Choose to have at most one pair (so a single pair of two sticks, and the rest all unique). Then, the brother can&#39;t form two pairs.OR- Choose to have one triple (three of the same length), but even then, the brother can&#39;t form two pairs from that (since three elements can form one pair, leaving one element).But in this case, the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So to determine if Chef can create such a subset S.This complicates the problem. So the initial approach (checking if U &gt;=K) is insufficient. Because even when U &lt; K, Chef can still select a subset S where there&#39;s one pair and the rest are unique, leading to the brother being unable to form a rectangle.So we need to find if there&#39;s a subset S of size &gt;=K where the maximum possible number of pairs is less than two, and no length has four or more.But how to model this?This seems complicated, but perhaps there&#39;s a way to model it.An alternative approach is to find the minimal possible conditions where the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So in any case where:- The subset S has size &lt;4 → brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.OR- The subset S has all elements unique → brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.OR- The subset S has exactly one pair (two elements of the same length) and the rest are unique → brother can&#39;t form a rectangle (needs two pairs).OR- The subset S has three elements of the same length (three sticks), and the rest are unique → brother can&#39;t form a rectangle (needs two pairs, but only one pair possible).OR- The subset S has two pairs of the same length (four elements), but then brother can form a rectangle.So the key is, in subset S, the counts of the lengths must be such that there are not two pairs.So, the possible cases where brother can&#39;t form a rectangle are:1. S.size() &lt;4.2. All elements in S are unique.3. S has exactly one pair (two sticks of same length) and the rest unique.4. S has three sticks of one length and the rest unique (but this gives one pair, and one more stick of the same length, but not two pairs).5. S has two sticks of one length and two sticks of another (then two pairs → brother can form a rectangle).So the challenge is to find if Chef can select a subset S of size &gt;=K that falls into cases 1, 2, 3, or 4.But how to compute this efficiently?An alternative approach is to realize that Chef&#39;s best bet to prevent the brother from forming a rectangle is to minimize the number of pairs and avoid having two pairs.So Chef can:- Maximize the number of unique elements.- Include as few duplicates as possible.So, the optimal way for Chef to form a subset S is to select as many unique elements as possible, and if necessary, add duplicates in such a way that no two pairs are formed.So for example, Chef will first select all unique elements. Then, if the size is still less than K, he needs to add some duplicates, but in a way that no two pairs are formed.So let&#39;s model this process.Let&#39;s denote U as the number of unique elements in the array.Let&#39;s denote M as the maximum number of unique elements Chef can select. So M is U.Then, the remaining needed elements to reach K are (K - M). If K &lt;=M, then Chef can select K unique elements, leading to case 2. So output is -1.If K &gt;M, then Chef needs to add (K-M) elements from the duplicates, but each such addition must be done in a way that doesn&#39;t form additional pairs.Wait, but the duplicates are the elements that appear more than once in the original array.So for example, if there&#39;s an element that appears 3 times. Chef can take two of them, making a pair. But if he takes three, that gives one pair (since two of them form a pair, and the third is a single).But when Chef adds duplicates, he has to choose which elements to add.So the process would be:Chef can take all M unique elements.Then, he needs to add (K-M) elements. These elements must come from the duplicates. For each duplicate added, Chef can choose to take one of the duplicates (so not forming a pair), or take two (forming a pair).But to avoid forming two pairs, Chef can take at most one pair.So, for example:Suppose M=5, K=7. Then Chef needs to take 2 more elements. He can take two different duplicates, each once. Then, the subset has 5 unique elements plus two more (each from a different duplicate). This gives two singles. So no pairs. But this is possible only if the original array has at least two elements with counts &gt;=2.Alternatively, Chef can take one pair (two elements of the same type) and no other duplicates. So the subset would have one pair and 5 unique elements. Total size is 5+2=7. Then, the brother can form a rectangle if there&#39;s another pair. But in this subset, there&#39;s only one pair. So brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So the key is to see if Chef can add the required (K-M) elements in a way that results in at most one pair.So let&#39;s model this.Let D be the number of elements that have a count &gt;=2 in the original array. For example, if the original array has elements [1,1,2,3,3,3], then D is 2 (since 1 and 3 appear at least twice).So when Chef has to add (K-M) elements beyond the unique elements, he can choose to add:- All as single elements (but each requires that the original element has a count &gt;=2, since Chef can only take one from each such element). So the number of available elements for this is D. Because each of the D elements can contribute at least one extra (since their count is &gt;=2). So the maximum number of singles he can add is D. For example, if D is 3, then Chef can add 3 elements (one from each of the D elements).- Alternatively, Chef can add a pair (two elements from one of the D elements), and then the rest as singles. The number of elements added in this case is 2 (pair) + (other singles).So the goal is to see whether (K - M) can be achieved by adding a combination of singles and possibly one pair.So let&#39;s formalize this:Let needed = K - M.If needed &lt;=0 → Chef can select M unique elements (which is &gt;=K, since M &gt;=K when needed is &lt;=0). So output -1.Else:We need to select &#39;needed&#39; elements from the D elements (each of which has count &gt;=2).Each such element can contribute 1 (if we take one) or 2 (if we take two).But Chef can take at most one pair (i.e., 2 elements from the same element) and the rest as singles.So the maximum number of elements that can be added in this way is (D + 1) if there&#39;s at least one element in D. Because:If there&#39;s at least one element in D:- Chef can take 2 elements from one (a pair) → 2 elements.- Take one from each of (needed - 2) elements → but if (needed - 2) &gt;0, but D-1 &gt;= (needed - 2).Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, the maximum possible elements that can be added without creating two pairs is:If Chef uses one pair (2 elements), then the remaining (needed -2) elements must be taken as singles from different elements. So the total is 2 + (needed -2) = needed elements.But this requires that:- There is at least one element in D (to take the pair).- The remaining (needed -2) must be &lt;= (D-1) → because after using one element for the pair, there are (D-1) elements left to take singles.So if (needed -2) &lt;= (D-1), then possible.ORChef can take all needed elements as singles, which requires that D &gt;= needed.So the possible scenarios are:If Chef can add &#39;needed&#39; elements in such a way that he either:a) Takes (needed) elements as singles from D different elements (requires D &gt;= needed).ORb) Takes 2 elements from one element (pair) and (needed -2) elements as singles from (needed -2) different elements (requires (D &gt;= 1) and (needed -2) &lt;= (D-1)).If either of these is possible, then Chef can form a subset S of size (M + needed) = K, which has either:- M unique elements plus (needed) singles from D elements (so no pairs except possibly one).Wait, if he takes the singles from D elements, which originally have count &gt;=2. So taking one from each would add to the subset. So the subset would have:For each of the D elements selected, the count in the subset would be 1 (since M unique elements are already taken once). So, for example, if an element has count 3 in the original array, and Chef takes one for the M unique elements, then there are two left. If Chef then takes one more (as part of the added elements), then in the subset, that element would have count 2. So that&#39;s a pair.Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:Original array has element X with count 3.In the subset S:- X is part of the M unique elements (count 1 in subset).- Then, Chef adds one more X (so count 2 in subset). So this forms a pair.So if Chef adds one X (from the D elements), then that element&#39;s count in subset S is 2. So a pair.So adding a single from D elements (which have count &gt;=2 in the original array) would create a pair in the subset S.So, for example:Original array: [1,1,2,3,3,3]M=3 (unique elements 1,2,3). D=2 (elements 1 and 3, since they have count &gt;=2).Chef needs to add K-M=4-3=1 element.He can take one more 1 or 3. For example, add one 3. Now, the subset has 3 unique elements plus one 3. So counts are 1 (from M) +1 (added) → count 2. So a pair.So the subset has a pair, but no other pairs. So the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So in this case, the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So output is -1.So even if Chef adds one element from a D element, creating a pair, but no other pairs, the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.So this is another case where the output is -1.So the correct approach is to determine if Chef can add the needed elements in such a way that the subset S has at most one pair and no four elements (which would allow two pairs from the same element).So, the steps are:1. Compute U = number of unique elements in the array.2. If K &lt;=3 and N &gt;= K → output -1.3. Else if U &gt;= K → output -1.4. Else:   a. Compute D = number of elements with count &gt;=2.   b. Compute needed = K - U.   c. Check if Chef can add &#39;needed&#39; elements from the D elements such that:      i. All added elements are taken as singles from different D elements (so needed &lt;= D), and then after adding, each added element has count 2 in the subset. So this would create (D) pairs, but that&#39;s not allowed. Wait, no. Wait the initial U elements are all unique. When we add a single element from a D element, the subset will have that element appearing twice (since it was in the initial U and now added once). So each such addition creates a pair.      So if we add &#39;needed&#39; elements in this way, the number of pairs is &#39;needed&#39;.      For example, if needed is 2 and D &gt;=2 → Chef adds two elements from two D elements. Each of these elements has count 2 in the subset. So two pairs. Then brother can form a rectangle → output is not -1.      So this approach is only acceptable if the number of pairs created is ≤1.      So adding &#39;needed&#39; elements as singles from D elements will create &#39;needed&#39; pairs. So if needed ≥2, then Chef can&#39;t do this, as it will create two or more pairs.      So this approach is only valid if needed is 0 (but needed is K - U, which is &gt;0).      So this approach is invalid.   d. So the alternative is to take one pair (two elements from the same D element) and the rest needed -2 elements as singles from other D elements.      But when you take two elements from the same D element, the subset has two pairs (since it was already in the initial U elements? Or not?)      Wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify.      The initial U elements are unique. So if an element is in U, its count in the subset is 1.      When we add two elements from the same D element, that element&#39;s count in the subset becomes 3 (initial 1 + 2 added). So that&#39;s three instances. So in the subset S, this element has count 3. The brother can take two pairs (two pairs of two), but with three elements, you can only form one pair. So the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle from this element alone.      But if Chef takes two elements from one D element and one element from another D element:      For example:      D elements are [a, b]. U is 3 (includes a and b).      Chef needs to add needed =3 elements.      He can take two a&#39;s (so subset has a: 3, b:1, ...).      Then take one b (subset has a:3, b:2).      So the pairs are a (3 → one pair), b (2 → one pair). So brother can form a rectangle using the two pairs (a and b), leading to area a*b.      So this approach is not acceptable.      So the only way to add the needed elements without forming two pairs is to take one pair (two elements from one D element) and the rest as elements from non-D elements (but that&#39;s impossible because D elements are those with count &gt;=2 in the original array).      Wait, no. D elements are those with count &gt;=2, so Chef can take two from one D element (adding two to the subset) and others from D elements.      Hmm, this is getting really complicated.      Perhaps an alternative approach is needed.      Let&#39;s think differently. To prevent the brother from forming a rectangle, the subset S must not contain two pairs.      So in S, the maximum number of pairs is one.      So the possible scenarios for S are:      - All elements unique (zero pairs).      - Exactly one pair (two elements of the same length) and the rest unique.      - One triplet (three elements of the same length) and the rest unique (so one pair).      So Chef needs to choose a subset S of size &gt;=K such that the number of pairs (counting each occurrence as possible) is at most one.      So the steps to determine if Chef can choose such a subset S are:      1. If K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K → output -1.      2. Else if U &gt;= K → output -1.      3. Else:         a. Compute the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed in S. If Chef can select S such that the number of pairs is &lt;=1, then output is -1.         b. Else, proceed to compute the minimal maximum area.      So the problem reduces to: can Chef select S of size &gt;=K where the number of pairs (each pair is two elements) is &lt;=1?      To find this, Chef can:      - Take as many unique elements as possible.      - If more elements are needed (K - U), add elements in a way that creates at most one pair.      So, the maximum number of pairs in S is:      (number of elements added beyond U that form pairs) + existing pairs from U.      Wait, but U is the number of unique elements. So in the initial U elements, there are no pairs.      So any pairs in S come from the elements added beyond U.      So when Chef adds elements beyond U, each such element must be from a duplicate in the original array. Because U is the unique elements.      So, for each added element, it&#39;s from a duplicate (count &gt;=2 in the original array). So when Chef adds one such element to S, it increases the count of that element in S by 1 (from 1 to 2, forming a pair). Adding a second such element (from the same original element) increases the count to 3, which allows one pair (two elements).      So, for each added element:      - If added once → count increases to 2 → forms a pair.      - If added twice → count increases to 3 → one pair.      - If added three times → count increases to 4 → two pairs (but that would allow brother to form a rectangle).      So, Chef must avoid adding more than two elements from the same original element (as that would allow two pairs).      So the way to add the needed elements (K - U) is:      - Take one element from (needed) different D elements → this creates (needed) pairs. So if needed &gt;=2, then this is not acceptable (brother can form a rectangle).      So this scenario is only acceptable if needed is 0 or 1.      Or:      - Take two elements from one D element (creating one pair) and the remaining (needed-2) from other D elements (each added once, creating (needed-2) pairs). So total pairs is 1 + (needed-2) = needed-1. To have this &lt;=1, needed-1 &lt;=1 → needed &lt;=2.      So for example, if needed=2:      Take two elements from one D element (1 pair) and zero more. So total pairs=1 → acceptable.      If needed=3:      Take two from one (1 pair) and one from another → total pairs=1 +1=2 → not acceptable.      So, in this case, it&#39;s impossible.      So Chef can form a subset S with at most one pair only if:      (K - U) can be achieved by adding either:      a) 0 elements → K = U.      b) 1 element → add one element from a D element (1 pair).      c) 2 elements → add two elements from one D element (1 pair).      d) 3 elements → add two from one D element (1 pair) and one from another (1 pair) → total 2 pairs → not allowed.      So, the maximum allowed needed is 2.      So if (K - U) &lt;= 2 and there&#39;s at least one D element, then Chef can form a subset S with at most one pair.      So the conditions are:      (K - U) &lt;= 2 and D &gt;=1.      Because:      - For needed=1: add one element from a D element → 1 pair.      - For needed=2: add two elements from one D element → 1 pair.      So in both cases, S has exactly one pair. Brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.      But if needed is greater than 2, then it&#39;s impossible. For example, needed=3: Chef has to add 3 elements. He can add two from one D element (1 pair) and one from another (1 pair) → total 2 pairs → brother can form a rectangle. Or add three from one D element → 3 elements (1 pair and one single) → but then needed=3 is achieved. But this creates three elements of the same length, which allows one pair, but no other pairs. So brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.      Wait, no. Three elements of the same length can form one pair. So the brother needs another pair. If all other elements in S are unique, then he can&#39;t find another pair. So even if needed=3 and Chef adds three elements of the same D element (so total three of that element in S), then the brother can only form one pair and can&#39;t form a rectangle.      So this is possible. So the approach is more nuanced.      Let&#39;s think again:      If needed is 3, Chef can add three elements from the same D element. This would make the count in S as 1 (initial) +3 → 4. So four elements of the same length → two pairs. So brother can form a rectangle (two pairs of the same length). So in this case, it&#39;s not allowed.      But if Chef adds three elements from the same D element, then in S, the count is 4. So brother can take four of them to form a rectangle. So that&#39;s a problem.      So Chef must avoid creating two pairs. So even adding three elements from the same D element creates two pairs (four elements), which is not allowed.      So the only way to add three elements is to have two from one D element (two pairs?) → no. Wait, two elements from the same D element added to the initial one (from U) gives three elements. So count is 3 → one pair (two elements), one single. So brother can&#39;t form a rectangle.      So adding three elements from the same D element would mean:      initial count: 1 (from U).      add three more → total 4. So count is 4 → two pairs. So brother can form a rectangle. So this is not allowed.      So adding three elements from the same D element is not allowed.      So the only way to add three elements is to take two from one D element (count becomes 3 → one pair) and one from another D element (count becomes 2 → one pair). So total pairs is two → brother can form a rectangle. So this is not allowed.      So for needed &gt;=3, it&#39;s impossible to create a subset S with at most one pair.      So the only possible scenarios where Chef can create a subset S with at most one pair are:      needed &lt;= 2 and D &gt;=1.      Additionally:      For needed=2, Chef must add two elements from the same D element (so that the count becomes 3 → one pair).      So to summarize:      If (K - U) &lt;= 2 and D &gt;= (1 if needed &gt;0 else 0), then Chef can create a subset S with at most one pair, leading to output -1.      So the conditions for output -1 are:      1. K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K → output -1.      2. U &gt;= K → output -1.      3. Else, if (K - U) is 1 and D &gt;=1 → output -1.      4. Else, if (K - U) is 2 and D &gt;=1 (can take two elements from one D element) → output -1.      So the steps are:      For each test case:      a. If K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K → output -1.      b. Else:         i. Compute U = number of unique elements.         ii. If U &gt;= K → output -1.         iii. Else:             - Compute needed = K - U.             - Compute D = number of elements with count &gt;=2 (since those can contribute to pairs).             - If (needed ==1 and D &gt;=1) → output -1.             - Elif (needed ==2 and D &gt;=1) → output -1.             - Else → proceed to compute the minimal possible area.      So this covers the cases where Chef can create a subset S with no possible rectangle.      Now, let&#39;s test the sample input 2:      Sample input 2:      T=1.      N=5, K=4.      Sticks: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] → U=3 (elements 1, 2, 3).      D: elements with count &gt;=2 are 1 (count 2), 2 (count 2). So D=2.      needed =4-3=1.      So needed=1, D=2 &gt;=1 → output -1. Which matches the sample output.      So this case is covered.      Sample input 1:      Test case 1:      N=7, K=6.      Sticks: [1,2,3,1,2,2,1].      U is 3 (elements 1,2,3).      K=6 → U=3 &lt;6.      needed=6-3=3.      D: elements 1 (count 3), 2 (count3). So D=2.      needed=3. So not covered by any of the conditions (needed &gt;2). So output is not -1.      So Chef can&#39;t prevent the brother from forming a rectangle. So we need to compute the minimal possible maximum area.      So the sample output is 2.      So now, when it&#39;s impossible for Chef to prevent the brother from forming a rectangle, we need to compute the minimal possible maximum area.      So, how to compute that?      Now, when Chef can&#39;t prevent the brother from forming a rectangle, he wants to choose a subset S of size &gt;=K such that the maximum possible area the brother can form is as small as possible.      The brother will choose the two largest pairs possible.      So Chef&#39;s goal is to choose S such that the largest possible pairs in S are as small as possible.      So the approach here is to select the subset S with size &gt;=K such that the largest possible pairs are minimized.      How to do this?      The optimal strategy for Chef is to select the smallest possible pairs.      So he should include as many small elements as possible.      So the steps are:      - Sort all sticks in non-decreasing order.      - Select the K elements that are the smallest possible, but ensuring that there are at least two pairs (or a four of the same element).      Wait, but the selection of the subset S must be such that brother can form a rectangle. So S must have at least two pairs.      So Chef&#39;s optimal strategy is to select the smallest elements possible, but ensuring that there are enough pairs for the brother to form a rectangle.      So the approach is:      1. Sort the array.      2. Find the earliest two pairs (smallest possible pairs) that can be formed in the subset.      But how to model this?      So, for the subset S, the brother will select the two largest pairs possible to get the maximum area. So Chef needs to select S in such a way that the two largest pairs in S are as small as possible.      So Chef&#39;s best strategy is to select the K smallest elements, but also ensure that there are two pairs.      So the steps are:      a. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.      b. Consider the smallest K elements.      c. Count the frequencies in these K elements.      d. Check if there are two pairs (or a four).      If yes, then the brother will choose the two largest pairs, which is the minimal possible maximum area.      Else, perhaps Chef can include some larger elements to have two pairs but still minimize the maximum area.      This is getting complicated.      Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to select the K smallest elements and see if they can form two pairs. If yes, then the answer is determined by the two largest pairs in this subset. If not, then Chef must include some larger elements to allow the brother to form a rectangle, but choose them in a way that the area is minimized.      But this is not straightforward.      Another approach is to generate all possible pairs in the array and find the minimal possible maximum area.      For the brother to form a rectangle, he needs two pairs. The pairs can be two distinct lengths (a and b) with a &lt;= b, and the area is a * b. Or a single length with four sticks (area a*a).      So to find the minimal possible maximum area, Chef must select a subset S where the two largest possible pairs in S are as small as possible.      So the optimal way is to find the earliest possible pairs in the sorted array.      So, perhaps the approach is:      1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.      2. For each possible subset S (of size &gt;=K), find the maximum possible area of the rectangle that can be formed.      3. Find the minimal such maximum area.      But this is not feasible for large N.      So we need an efficient way to compute this.      Let&#39;s think of the sorted array. The best pairs are the largest possible. So to minimize the area, Chef should include as few large elements as possible.      So the optimal strategy for Chef is to select the smallest K elements and form pairs from them.      But how to ensure that in the subset of K elements, there are at least two pairs.      So here&#39;s an algorithm:      - Sort the array in non-decreasing order.      - Take the first K elements.      - Check if there are two pairs in these K elements.      - If yes, then compute the maximum possible area (which is the largest two pairs in this subset).      - If no, then Chef must include some larger elements to form two pairs, but this will increase the maximum possible area.      So the minimal possible area is the minimal possible between the two scenarios.      So, the steps would be:      1. Sort the array.      2. Consider the first K elements.      3. Count the frequencies of each element in these K elements.      4. Find the largest two pairs (the two largest distinct elements with counts &gt;=2, or a single element with count &gt;=4).      5. If two pairs are found, this is a candidate for the minimal maximum area.      6. If not, we need to look for the next possible pairs by including elements beyond the first K.      This is getting a bit involved.      Alternatively, the minimal possible maximum area is determined by the earliest possible pairs in the sorted array.      So the optimal way is to select the earliest possible pairs.      For example, in the sample input 1:      Sorted array: [1,1,1,2,2,2,3]      K=6. So first 6 elements: [1,1,1,2,2,2].      In this subset, the frequencies are 1:3, 2:3. So pairs are 1 and 2. The largest two pairs are 2 and 2. So the area is 2*2=4. But the sample output is 2. So this approach is not correct.      Wait, sample input 1&#39;s explanation says that Chef gives all sticks except one (so 6 sticks). So the subset includes three 1s, two 2s, and one 3. But he can&#39;t give all the first 6 elements because he&#39;s giving 6 sticks (sample input&#39;s K is 6). Wait, sample input 1&#39;s K is 6, N is7. So Chef gives 6 sticks. The explanation says he gives all except one. So the subset is 6 sticks, but not the first 6.      Ah, this suggests that the approach of selecting the first K elements may not be correct. Because Chef can choose any subset of size &gt;=K, not necessarily the first K elements.      So the problem is that Chef&#39;s selection of S is not constrained to be the smallest elements. He can choose any subset of size &gt;=K that allows him to minimize the brother&#39;s maximum area.      So, in sample input 1, the optimal subset for Chef is to exclude one 3, giving 6 sticks. The subset contains three 1s, two 2s, and one 3. So the brother can choose two 1s and two 2s. The area is 1*2=2.      If Chef had selected the first six elements (three 1s and three 2s), the brother could choose two 2s and two 2s, leading to area 2*2=4. Which is larger. But Chef&#39;s optimal choice is to exclude one 2 and include the 3, thereby limiting the brother&#39;s options.      So, the approach of selecting the first K elements is not correct.      So we need a way to find the optimal subset S of size &gt;=K such that the maximum possible area is minimized.      How to model this?      The brother&#39;s maximum area is determined by the largest two pairs in S. So Chef wants to select S such that the largest two pairs are as small as possible.      So, the problem reduces to finding two pairs (possibly the same length) in the array such that:      - The sum of the counts of all elements up to those pairs is &gt;= K.      - The product of the two pairs&#39; lengths is minimized.      But this is not straightforward.      Alternatively, the optimal subset S for Chef will include the minimal possible pairs. So, to find the minimal possible maximal area, we need to find the earliest possible pairs in the sorted array.      For example, in sample input 1, the minimal possible pairs are 1 and 2.      So, the approach is to find the earliest two pairs (i.e., smallest possible lengths) that can be included in a subset S of size &gt;=K.      So here&#39;s a possible approach:      1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.      2. For each possible pair of lengths (a, b), where a &lt;= b, compute the minimal number of elements needed to include at least two pairs of a and two pairs of b (or four of a).      3. Find the pair (a, b) with the minimal a * b such that the required elements to form two pairs can be selected in a subset of size &gt;=K.      4. The minimal such a * b is the answer.      But this is computationally expensive for large N.      So, we need a more efficient approach.      Let&#39;s think of how to find the minimal possible product a * b, where a &lt;= b, and there are at least two pairs (a and b) in the array. We need to select a subset S of size &gt;=K where these pairs are present.      To find this, we can track the frequencies of each length in the entire array. Then, for each possible pair of lengths (a, b) where a &lt;= b, we compute how many elements are needed to form two pairs of a and two pairs of b (or four of a).      The minimal product of a * b is our answer.      But again, this is not efficient for large N.      So, perhaps the optimal approach is to first collect all possible candidates (elements with counts &gt;=2), sorted in non-decreasing order. Then, find the earliest two pairs in this sorted list.      Let&#39;s think of the steps:      1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.      2. Count the frequency of each element. Create a list of elements with their counts, sorted by the element&#39;s value.      3. For each element in this list, track how many times it appears and the positions.      Then, we can look for pairs:      The brother can form a rectangle in two ways:      - Two pairs of two different elements.      - Four of the same element.      So, the minimal possible area is the minimal between the minimal two different pairs and the minimal four of the same.      So the approach is:      1. Find all elements that appear at least twice. For each such element, compute the maximum possible number of pairs (count // 2).      2. Sort these elements in non-decreasing order.      3. For two different elements, a and b (a &lt;= b), the minimal product is a*b. We need to find the minimal a*b such that the total number of elements needed to form two pairs of a and two pairs of b is &lt;= N, and that subset S can be of size &gt;=K.      Alternatively, we need to find the minimal a*b where a and b can be selected from the array, with a &lt;= b, and the sum of the minimal elements required to form two pairs of a and two pairs of b is &lt;= the total number of elements.      But this is not directly applicable.      Alternatively, the approach is to iterate through all possible pairs (a, b) where a &lt;= b, and a and b can form two pairs. For each such pair, compute the minimal number of elements needed to have two pairs of a and two pairs of b. Then, check if there exists a subset S of size &gt;=K that includes these elements. The minimal a*b for which this is possible is the answer.      But this seems computationally intensive.      Perhaps the correct approach is to collect all elements that have count &gt;= 2, and then for each element, compute how many times it can contribute to pairs.      Then, iterate through these elements in sorted order and try to find two pairs.      Let me think of the sample input 1:      The array is [1,1,1,2,2,2,3]. After sorting, the elements are [1,1,1,2,2,2,3].      The elements with counts &gt;=2 are 1 (count 3), 2 (count 3).      So sorted list is [1,2].      The possible pairs are:      - Two pairs of 1 and two pairs of 2: area 1*2=2.      - Four 1&#39;s: area 1*1=1.      But for four 1&#39;s, we need to select four 1&#39;s, which requires four elements. The total subset size is 4. If K &lt;=4, then it&#39;s possible. But in sample input 1, K is 6. So the subset must have at least 6 elements. So to include four 1&#39;s and some others.      But in this case, the area is 1*1=1. But the sample output is 2. So why?      Because Chef&#39;s optimal choice is to include three 1&#39;s, three 2&#39;s. The brother can take four 2&#39;s (two pairs) → area 2*2=4. But Chef can&#39;t choose that. But how?      Oh, because Chef&#39;s goal is to choose the subset S such that the brother&#39;s maximum area is minimized.      So in the case where the array has three 1&#39;s and three 2&#39;s (subset size 6), the brother can take two pairs of 2&#39;s (area 4) or two pairs of 1&#39;s (area 1). But the brother will choose the maximum, which is 4. So Chef wants to avoid this.      So Chef&#39;s optimal choice is to exclude some 2&#39;s and include a 3. So the subset has three 1&#39;s, two 2&#39;s, and one 3. Then, the brother can&#39;t take two pairs of 2&#39;s (only one pair), but can take two pairs of 1&#39;s and two pairs of 2&#39;s. Wait, but in this case, there are three 1&#39;s (one pair), two 2&#39;s (one pair). So brother can take two pairs (1 and 2), area 1*2=2.      So this is better for Chef.      So the minimal maximum area is 2.      So the key is to find the earliest possible pairs where the sum of the required elements is &lt;= N and &gt;=K.      So perhaps the approach is:      For each possible pair of elements (a, b), sorted in non-decreasing order:      - Find the earliest occurrence where there are at least two pairs of a and two pairs of b (if a != b) or at least four of a (if a == b).      - Compute the minimal number of elements required to collect these pairs.      For example, in sample input 1:      a=1, b=2.      To get two pairs of 1 and two pairs of 2:      - Two pairs of 1 requires at least four 1&#39;s (but there are only three). So this isn&#39;t possible. Alternatively, two pairs of 1 can be formed from three 1&#39;s (since two pairs would need four elements, but three 1&#39;s can form one pair plus a single).      Wait, no. Two pairs of 1 would require four 1&#39;s. Three 1&#39;s can only form one pair.      So in this case, there are three 1&#39;s and three 2&#39;s. So two pairs of 1&#39;s require four 1&#39;s. Not possible. So the brother can&#39;t use two pairs of 1&#39;s. So the brother can use one pair of 1&#39;s and one pair of 2&#39;s. Which requires two pairs.      So in the subset S, the brother can take two 1&#39;s and two 2&#39;s. So the pairs are one pair of 1&#39;s and one pair of 2&#39;s. So the area is 1*2=2.      So how to model this?      So, for a pair (a, b), where a &lt;= b, the required elements are:      - If a != b: two occurrences of a and two of b.      - If a == b: four occurrences of a.      So the minimal number of elements needed is:      For a != b: 2 + 2 =4.      For a == b: 4.      So to form a rectangle, the subset S must contain at least four elements: four of a, or two of a and two of b.      So for Chef to allow the brother to form a rectangle, he must select a subset S of size &gt;=K that contains at least four elements in one of these configurations.      So the minimal possible area is the minimal possible a*b among all such possible pairs (a, b) in the array.      So the approach is:      1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.      2. Iterate through the array and collect all possible pairs (a, b) where a &lt;= b and the required number of elements for the pair exists.      3. For each such pair, compute the minimal number of elements needed (4 for a != b, 4 for a == b).      4. For each such pair, check if there exists a subset S of size &gt;=K that includes these elements and possibly others. If the total number of elements in the array is &gt;= K, then this subset S can be formed.      5. Among all possible pairs, select the one with the minimal a*b. If there are no such pairs, output -1.      So this would require checking all possible pairs (a, b) in the array.      But this is computationally expensive for large N.      So we need an efficient way to find the minimal a*b.      Let&#39;s think of this: the minimal a*b is achieved by the smallest possible a and b.      So we can iterate through the sorted array and collect the possible pairs.      For example, in the sample input 1:      The sorted array is [1,1,1,2,2,2,3].      We need to find pairs (a, b) where a &lt;= b and there are at least two a&#39;s and two b&#39;s.      The earliest possible a is 1. Then b can be 1 or 2.      For a=1, b=1: requires four 1&#39;s. But there are only three. So not possible.      For a=1, b=2: requires two 1&#39;s and two 2&#39;s. The earliest occurrence is after four elements (1,1,2,2). So the minimal a*b is 1*2=2.      For a=2, b=2: requires four 2&#39;s. There are three. Not possible.      For a=1, b=3: requires two 1&#39;s and two 3&#39;s. But there&#39;s only one 3. So not possible.      So the minimal product is 2.      So the answer is 2.      So this approach seems to work.      So the steps are:      1. Sort the array.      2. Iterate through the array and keep track of the occurrences of each element.      3. For each element, track the earliest positions where at least two occurrences are found.      4. For each possible pair (a, b) where a &lt;= b, check if there are at least two a&#39;s and two b&#39;s.      5. For each such pair, compute a*b and keep track of the minimal one.      6. Also check for elements with at least four occurrences (for the case a == b).      7. The minimal a*b among all these possibilities is the answer.      But how to efficiently find all possible pairs (a, b) with a &lt;= b and sufficient counts.      One efficient way is to:      - Create a frequency dictionary.      - Collect all elements that have count &gt;=2.      - Sort this list in non-decreasing order.      - For each element a in this list:         a. If the count of a is &gt;=4, then consider a*a as a possible product.         b. For each element b in the list where b &gt;=a and comes after a:             i. If a ==b, continue (already considered in a).             ii. Else, consider a*b as a possible product.      The minimal product among all these possibilities is the answer.      But this is O(M^2), where M is the number of elements with count &gt;=2. For large N, M could be up to 1e5, leading to O(1e10) operations. Not feasible.      So we need a more efficient approach.      Let&#39;s think of the sorted list of elements with count &gt;=2.      For example, after sorting, the list is [1, 2, 3, ...].      The minimal product a*b is the product of the two smallest elements in this list.      So the earliest possible pairs would be the two smallest elements in the list.      So the minimal product is the product of the two smallest elements.      But wait, this isn&#39;t always the case. For example, if there&#39;s an element that appears four times, then the product would be a*a, which may be smaller than the product of the two smallest elements.      So, the correct approach is to compare the product of the two smallest distinct elements with the square of the smallest element that appears at least four times.      So the steps are:      1. Find all elements with count &gt;=2. Sort them in non-decreasing order.      2. Find the earliest element with count &gt;=4. The minimal square is a*a.      3. Find the earliest two distinct elements in the list. The product is a*b.      4. The minimal between the two is the answer.      So, for example, in sample input 1:      The elements with count &gt;=2 are [1,2]. The earliest two distinct elements are 1 and 2, product is 2. No element with count &gt;=4. So answer is 2.      In sample input 2:      The elements with count &gt;=2 are [1,2]. But in the optimal subset chosen by Chef, the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So the answer is -1.      So the algorithm would be:      If it is possible to form a rectangle (i.e., the answer is not -1):         1. Collect all elements with count &gt;=2.         2. Sort them in non-decreasing order.         3. Find the minimal a*b between:             a. The square of the first element with count &gt;=4.             b. The product of the first two distinct elements in the list.         4. The answer is the minimal of these two.      So, the code steps:      After checking for the -1 cases, we proceed:      - Sort the array.      - Count the frequency of each element.      - Collect all elements that have count &gt;=2, sorted.      - Find the first element in this list with count &gt;=4 → min_square.      - Find the first two distinct elements in this list → their product is min_product.      - The answer is the minimal between min_square and min_product. If neither exists, output -1.      But how to handle the frequencies in the subset S chosen by Chef?      Because Chef can select any subset of size &gt;=K, but he wants to minimize the brother&#39;s maximum area.      So, the minimal possible area is determined by the earliest possible pairs in the array that can be included in some subset S of size &gt;=K.      So, even if there are two elements a and b (a &lt;= b) in the array, but they are not present in any subset S of size &gt;=K, then they can&#39;t be considered.      So, the problem is to find the earliest possible pairs (a, b) such that the number of elements required to form two pairs of a and two of b is &lt;= N and the subset S can be of size &gt;=K.      But how to check if there are enough elements in the array to form such a subset S?      For example, to form two pairs of a and two pairs of b, the array must have at least two a&#39;s and two b&#39;s. But how does this relate to K?      Chef can choose a subset S that includes these four elements plus others to reach size K. The brother will choose the largest possible pairs, but Chef&#39;s selection must allow those pairs to exist.      But Chef&#39;s goal is to select a subset S where the brother can form a rectangle, but the area is as small as possible.      So, the minimal possible area is determined by the earliest pairs that are present in the array and can be included in a subset S of size &gt;=K.      So, the approach is:      The earliest possible pairs (a, b) in the array that have enough occurrences to be included in some subset S of size &gt;=K.      So, the code steps:      1. Sort the array.      2. Count the frequencies.      3. Create a list of elements with frequency &gt;=2, sorted.      4. Iterate through this list to find the minimal a*b product.      5. For each element in the list:          a. If frequency &gt;=4, then a*a is a candidate. The minimal number of elements required is 4. So if K &lt;=4, then this is possible.          b. For each subsequent element in the list (b &gt;= a), the product a*b is a candidate. The minimal number of elements required is 2 (a) + 2 (b) =4. So if K &lt;=4, this is possible.      But how to handle K &gt;4?      For example, if K=6, the subset S must have at least 6 elements, and must include at least two pairs (a and b) or four a&#39;s.      So, the subset S can include the four elements needed for the pairs, plus any other elements.      So, as long as there are four elements (two pairs) in the array, Chef can form a subset S of size &gt;=K by adding other elements. Because K &lt;=N.      But wait, N is the total number of sticks. So if K &lt;=N, then Chef can choose S as the entire array, which includes the four elements needed for the pairs.      So, the presence of any pair (a, b) in the array with sufficient counts (&gt;=2 each) implies that there exists a subset S of size &gt;=K (since K &lt;=N).      So, if the array has at least two pairs (a and b), then Chef cannot prevent the brother from forming a rectangle. So the answer is the minimal possible a*b.      So, the minimal a*b is determined by the earliest possible pairs in the array.      So, the code steps are:      After determining that output is not -1:         1. Collect all elements with frequency &gt;=2, sorted.         2. Find the minimal a*a where a has frequency &gt;=4.         3. Find the minimal a*b where a and b are the first two distinct elements in the list.         4. The answer is the minimal between these two.         5. If neither exists, output -1 (but this case is already handled earlier).      So this is the approach.      Now, to implement this:      - For each test case:          a. Read N, K, and the array.          b. Check the conditions for output -1.          c. If not -1:              i. Sort the array.              ii. Count frequencies.              iii. Create a list of elements with frequency &gt;=2, sorted.              iv. Find the minimal square (a*a) where a has frequency &gt;=4.              v. Find the minimal product of two distinct elements (a*b) from the list.              vi. The answer is the minimal between iv and v.              vii. If no such candidates exist, output -1 (but this is already handled in earlier steps).      So in sample input 1:      The list is [1,2].      Minimal square is None (no elements with frequency &gt;=4).      Minimal product is 1*2=2.      So answer is 2.      Sample input 2:      After checking, output is -1.      Another example:      Test case where array is [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3], K=5.      The frequencies are 2:4, 3:4.      The list of elements &gt;=2 is [2,3].      Minimal square is 2*2=4 (since 2 has frequency 4).      Minimal product is 2*3=6.      So answer is 4.      So the brother can choose four 2&#39;s and get area 4.      So, the code should work.      Now, let&#39;s implement this.      The code steps:      Read T test cases.      For each test case:          Read N, K.          Read the array.          Check for case 1: K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K → output -1.          Else:              Compute U = number of unique elements.              If U &gt;= K → output -1.              Else:                  Compute needed = K - U.                  Compute D = number of elements with count &gt;=2.                  If (needed &lt;=2 and D &gt;=1) → output -1.                  Else:                      proceed to compute the minimal area.                      Sort the array.                      freq = Counter(array).                      elements = sorted(freq.keys())                      two_or_more = [x for x in elements if freq[x] &gt;=2]                      min_square = infinity                      for x in two_or_more:                          if freq[x] &gt;=4:                              min_square = min(min_square, x*x)                      min_product = infinity                      first = None                      for x in two_or_more:                          if first is None:                              first = x                          else:                              min_product = min(min_product, first * x)                              break  # since we need the first two distinct                      # Also check if there are at least two distinct elements.                      answer = min(min_square, min_product)                      if answer == infinity:                          print(-1)                      else:                          print(answer)      But wait, the two_or_more list may have elements with frequency &gt;=2, but how to find the first two distinct elements?      For example, two_or_more = [1,1,2,3]. Then the first two distinct are 1 and 2.      So in the code, the loop would be:      first = None      for x in two_or_more:          if first is None:              first = x              continue          if x != first:              min_product = first * x              break      So after sorting, the two_or_more list is sorted, so the first two distinct elements are the first and the next element that is different.      So in code:      two_or_more_sorted = sorted(two_or_more)      first = None      for x in two_or_more_sorted:          if first is None:              first = x          else:              if x != first:                  min_product = first * x                  break      So this would find the minimal product of two distinct elements.      Also, the min_square is the minimal x*x where x&#39;s frequency is &gt;=4.      Then, the answer is the minimal between min_square and min_product. If both are infinity, output -1.      So in code:      # compute two_or_more_sorted      two_or_more_sorted = sorted([x for x in freq if freq[x] &gt;=2])      min_square = float(&#39;inf&#39;)      for x in two_or_more_sorted:          if freq[x] &gt;=4:              if x*x &lt; min_square:                  min_square = x * x      min_product = float(&#39;inf&#39;)      first = None      for x in two_or_more_sorted:          if first is None:              first = x          else:              if x != first:                  min_product = first * x                  break      # compute answer      res = min(min_square, min_product)      if res == float(&#39;inf&#39;):          print(-1)      else:          print(res)      But in this case, how can res be infinity? It means there are no elements with count &gt;=4 and no two distinct elements in two_or_more_sorted. Which would mean two_or_more_sorted has only one element, and its count is &gt;=2.      For example, array is [2,2,2], K=4.      After checking for -1 cases:      U=1, needed=4-1=3. D=1 (element 2).      needed=3, D=1.      So (needed &lt;=2 and D &gt;=1) → 3 &lt;=2 is false. So proceed.      two_or_more_sorted = [2].      So min_square is 2*2=4 (if freq[2] &gt;=4 → no, since freq is 3). So min_square is infinity.      min_product is also infinity.      So res is min(inf, inf) → inf. So output -1.      Which is correct, because with three 2&#39;s, you can&#39;t form two pairs. So the brother can&#39;t form a rectangle. So Chef&#39;s answer should be -1, but according to the previous steps, we should have already checked for this.      So there&#39;s a contradiction.      Wait, this indicates that the code may have a bug.      Let&#39;s re-examine the steps.      For the case where two_or_more_sorted has only one element with count &gt;=2 but &lt;4.      For example:      Array is [2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3], K=5. Then two_or_more_sorted is [2,3]. All steps work.      But in the case where array is [2,2,2], K=4.      The code would have passed the previous checks:      U=1, K=4.      U &lt;K.      needed =4-1=3.      D=1 (element 2 has count 3 &gt;=2).      So needed=3, D=1.      The condition (needed &lt;=2 and D &gt;=1) is needed=3 &lt;=2 → false. So proceed.      two_or_more_sorted is [2].      min_square is infinity (since 2&#39;s count is 3 &lt;4).      min_product is infinity (since no two distinct elements).      So res is infinity → output -1.      But according to the problem statement, if Chef can&#39;t prevent the brother from forming a rectangle, he must output the minimal area. But in this case, the array has three 2&#39;s. So in any subset S of size &gt;=4 (K=4), S must include all three 2&#39;s and one other element. But there&#39;s only three 2&#39;s and no other elements. So in this case, N=3 &lt;4. But K=4 and N=3 → Chef can&#39;t select any subset of size &gt;=4. So the test case is invalid.      So in this case, the initial check for K &lt;=3 is K=4 → no. Then, U=1 &lt;4. So needed=4-1=3. But N=3. So needed=3, but N=3. So N &gt;=K is 3 &gt;=4 → false. So this case is invalid.      So the code would not proceed to this step.      So the code must first check if N &gt;=K. Because Chef has to select a subset of size &gt;=K. So if N &lt;K, it&#39;s impossible.      Wait, no. The problem statement says that Chef has to give at least K sticks. So if the total number of sticks is less than K, then it&#39;s impossible to select any subset. But according to the problem&#39;s constraints, K is up to N. So in the code, the input is guaranteed to have K &lt;=N.      Because according to the problem&#39;s constraints:      For each test case:      0 ≤ K ≤ N.      So K is &lt;=N.      So in this case, K=4, N=3 is impossible. But according to the problem&#39;s constraints, K can&#39;t be larger than N.      So in code, we can assume that K &lt;=N.      So the code can proceed safely.      But in the example where the array is [2,2,2], K=3.      Then:      Check for K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K → K=3 &lt;=3, N=3 &gt;=3 → output -1.      So the code would output -1, which is correct.      So the code handles such cases.      So the code is correct.      Now, let&#39;s code this.      But we need to be careful with the steps.      So the code outline is:      Read T.      For each test case:          Read N, K.          Read array A.          if K &lt;=3 and N &gt;=K:              print(-1)              continue          else:              unique = len(set(A))              if unique &gt;= K:                  print(-1)                  continue              else:                  needed = K - unique                  # compute D: number of elements with count &gt;=2.                  freq = Counter(A)                  D = sum(1 for x in freq.values() if x &gt;=2)                  if needed &lt;=2 and D &gt;=1:                      print(-1)                      continue                  else:                      # compute the minimal area.                      # sort the array.                      A_sorted = sorted(A)                      # create a list of elements with count &gt;=2, sorted.                      two_or_more_sorted = sorted([x for x in freq if freq[x] &gt;=2])                      min_square = float(&#39;inf&#39;)                      for x in two_or_more_sorted:                          if freq[x] &gt;=4:                              current = x * x                              if current &lt; min_square:                                  min_square = current                      min_product = float(&#39;inf&#39;)                      first = None                      for x in two_or_more_sorted:                          if first is None:                              first = x                          else:                              if x != first:                                  min_product = first * x                                  break                      # also check if there are two elements.                      res = min(min_square, min_product)                      if res == float(&#39;inf&#39;):                          print(-1)                      else:                          print(res)      Now, let&#39;s test this code against the sample inputs.      Sample Input 1:      2      7 6      1 2 3 1 2 2 1      5 4      1 2 1 2 3      Sample Output 1:      2      -1      Test case 1:      After K=6, which is &gt;3.      unique =3.      needed=6-3=3.      D=2 (elements 1 and 2).      Check if needed &lt;=2 → 3 &lt;=2 is false. So proceed.      two_or_more_sorted = [1,2].      min_square: check 1 and 2.      freq[1] =3, freq[2]=3. So no elements with &gt;=4. So min_square remains infinity.      min_product: first is 1, next is 2 → 1*2=2.      res=2 → output 2.      Test case 2:      K=4.      Check if K &lt;=3 → no.      unique=3.      needed=4-3=1.      D=2 (elements 1 and 2).      needed &lt;=2 and D &gt;=1 → yes. So output -1.      So code works.      Another test case:      Test case where array is [2,2,2,2,3,3], K=5.      unique is 2 (2,3).      needed=5-2=3.      D=2.      Check if needed &lt;=2 and D &gt;=1 → 3 &lt;=2 → no.      two_or_more_sorted = [2,3].      min_square: 2 has freq 4 &gt;=4 → 2*2=4.      min_product: 2*3=6.      res=4.      So output is4.      Another test case:      array [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4], K=5.      unique=4.      needed=5-4=1.      D=4.      needed &lt;=2 and D &gt;=1 → yes. Output -1.      So code outputs -1.      So code seems correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if Chef can give his brother a set of sticks such that they cannot form a rectangle, or if they can, ensure the maximum possible area of the rectangle is minimized. Chef&#39;s goal is to minimize the area, while his brother aims to maximize it. Approach1. Impossible Cases:    - If Chef can give fewer than 4 sticks (when K ≤ 3), his brother cannot form a rectangle.   - If Chef can give all unique sticks (number of unique elements ≥ K), forming a rectangle is impossible.   - If Chef can form a set with at most one pair of sticks (even if it requires more than K sticks), forming a rectangle is impossible.2. Possible Cases:   - If forming a rectangle is unavoidable, we need to find the minimum possible area. This is done by considering the smallest possible pairs of stick lengths that can form a rectangle.

Reading Input: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.2. Check for Trivial Cases: If K ≤ 3, Chef can give K sticks which are too few to form a rectangle.3. Unique Sticks Check: If the number of unique sticks is ≥ K, Chef can give all unique sticks, making it impossible to form a rectangle.4. Pair Check: If Chef can form a set with at most one pair (even if more than K sticks are given), forming a rectangle is impossible.5. Finding Minimum Area: If forming a rectangle is unavoidable, we find the smallest possible pairs of stick lengths that can form a rectangle, either from two pairs of different lengths or four of the same length.This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal solution while adhering to the constraints.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ef989c89 data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review" data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review-title" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>❓:</span>Polycarp has 3 positive integers a, b and c. He can perform the following operation exactly once.Choose a positive integer m and multiply exactly one of the integers a, b or c by m.Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the sequence of three numbers a, b, c (in this order) forms an arithmetic progression ? Note that you cannot change the order of a, b and c.Formally, a sequence x_1, x_2, dots, x_n is called an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number d (called &quot;common difference&quot;) such that x_{i+1}=x_i+d for all i from 1 to n-1. In this problem, n=3.For example, the following sequences are AP: [5, 10, 15], [3, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], and [13, 10, 7]. The following sequences are not AP: [1, 2, 4], [0, 1, 0] and [1, 3, 2].You need to answer t independent test cases.-----Input-----The first line contains the number t (1 le t le 10^4) — the number of test cases.Each of the following t lines contains 3 integers a, b, c (1 le a, b, c le 10^8).-----Output-----For each test case print &quot;YES&quot; (without quotes) if Polycarp can choose a positive integer m and multiply exactly one of the integers a, b or c by m to make [a, b, c] be an arithmetic progression.

This is an AP with a difference d=-10.In the third test case, you can choose m=1 and multiply any number by 1. The resulting sequence will be [1, 2, 3]. This is an AP with a difference d=1.In the fourth test case, you can choose m=9 and multiply the first number (a=1) by 9. The resulting sequence will be [9, 6, 3]. This is an AP with a difference d=-3.In the fifth test case, it is impossible to make an AP.</div><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🧠:</span>Okay, I need to solve this problem where for each test case with three numbers a, b, c, I have to determine if multiplying exactly one of them by some positive integer m (exactly once) can result in an arithmetic progression. Let&#39;s think about how to approach this.First, let&#39;s recall what an arithmetic progression (AP) is. For three numbers to form an AP, the difference between the second and first should be equal to the difference between the third and second. So, the condition is 2b = a + c, but after possibly multiplying one of the numbers by m. But since exactly one of a, b, or c is multiplied by m, we have three cases to consider: multiply a, multiply b, or multiply c. For each case, we need to check if there&#39;s a valid m (positive integer) that satisfies the AP condition.Wait, but the multiplication is applied exactly once. So, for each case, exactly one number is multiplied by m, and the other two remain the same. Let&#39;s break down each possible scenario.Case 1: Multiply a by m. Then the new numbers are (a*m, b, c). We need this to form an AP. So the condition is 2b = (a*m) + c. We can solve for m here. Since m must be a positive integer, (a*m) must equal 2b - c. So m would be (2b - c)/a. But a must divide (2b - c), and the result must be a positive integer. Also, since m must be positive, (2b - c) must be positive if a is positive (but a is given as a positive integer, so that&#39;s okay). Wait, but 2b - c must be positive here because a*m is positive. Because a is positive and m is positive, so 2b - c must be equal to a positive a*m. So 2b - c must be positive, and a must divide it. So m is (2b -c)/a, which must be a positive integer.But wait, for example, if 2b - c is negative, then m would be negative. But m must be a positive integer. So in that case, this case is invalid. So for this case to work, 2b - c must be positive and divisible by a. Also, m must be (2b -c)/a, which must be &gt;=1 (since m is a positive integer). Wait, but m can be 0.5, but since m has to be a positive integer, if (2b -c)/a is fractional, it&#39;s invalid. So in this case, for the first scenario (multiplying a by m), we check if (2b - c) is divisible by a, and (2b -c)/a is a positive integer. So, for example, if 2b -c is positive, and a divides (2b -c), then yes.Case 2: Multiply b by m. The new numbers are (a, b*m, c). The AP condition becomes 2*(b*m) = a + c. Solving for m: m = (a + c)/(2b). Again, m must be a positive integer. So (a + c) must be divisible by 2b, and the result must be a positive integer. Also, since b is positive, (a + c) must be &gt;= 2b * 1 (since m &gt;=1). Wait, but m can be any positive integer, including fractions? Wait, no. Because m has to be a positive integer. Wait, the problem statement says &quot;positive integer m&quot;. So m has to be integer &gt;=1.Wait, no. The problem says exactly one of the integers a, b, or c is multiplied by m. So m is a positive integer, so yes, m must be &gt;=1. So in case 2, for m to be valid, (a + c) must be divisible by 2b, and the result (a+c)/(2b) must be a positive integer. Also, since a and c are positive, their sum is positive, and 2b is positive. So (a +c)/(2b) must be positive. Which it is, since all are positive. So in this case, m is (a + c)/(2b). So if this is an integer &gt;=1, then this case is valid.Case 3: Multiply c by m. The new numbers are (a, b, c*m). The AP condition is 2b = a + c*m. Solving for m: c*m = 2b -a. So m = (2b -a)/c. Again, m must be a positive integer. So 2b -a must be positive (since c is positive and m is positive), and c must divide (2b -a), and the result must be &gt;=1.So for each test case, we can check these three possibilities. If any of them is possible, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.But wait, there&#39;s another possibility: maybe after multiplying one of the numbers, the AP is formed even if the common difference is negative. For example, the AP [5,3,1] is allowed. So the order matters. The sequence must be a, b, c in order, but the common difference can be negative. So in all the above cases, the check is correct.So for each of the three cases, compute m and see if it&#39;s a positive integer. If any of the three is valid, output YES.Now, let&#39;s think about possible edge cases.Test case where all three are the same. For example, a=1, b=1, c=1. Then, multiplying any of them by m=1 (since m can be 1) leaves the sequence as [1,1,1], which is an AP. So in this case, the answer is YES. That&#39;s covered by any of the three cases. For example, in case 2, m would be (1+1)/(2*1) = 1, which is valid.Another case: a=2, b=6, c=3 (from the fifth test case in the example). Let&#39;s see. The answer is NO.Original numbers: 2,6,3. Let&#39;s check each case.Case1: multiply a by m. The new a is 2m. Then AP condition: 2*6 = 2m +3 → 12 = 2m +3 → 2m =9 → m=4.5. Not an integer. So invalid.Case2: multiply b by m. New b is6m. AP condition: 2*(6m) =2 +3 → 12m=5 → m=5/12. Not integer. Invalid.Case3: multiply c by m. New c is3m. AP condition: 2*6 = 2 +3m →12=2+3m →3m=10 →m=10/3≈3.333. Not integer. So all three cases invalid. So answer is NO, which matches the example.Another example: fourth test case input is 1 6 3. Output is YES. Let&#39;s see. Original a=1, b=6, c=3. The example says multiply a by m=9. Let&#39;s check. New a=9*1=9, so sequence is 9,6,3. AP with common difference -3. So 6-9= -3, 3-6=-3. So it&#39;s valid.So in this case, checking case1. The AP condition is 2*6 =9 +3 →12=12. So yes. How did they get m=9? Let&#39;s see. In case1, multiply a by m. So the condition is 2b = a*m +c. So 2*6 =1*m +3 →12= m +3 → m=9. Which is an integer. So case1 is valid, so answer is YES.So the approach is to check for each of the three possible operations (multiply a, multiply b, multiply c) whether the resulting m is a positive integer.Now, the steps for each test case:For each of the three possibilities (a, b, c being multiplied), compute the required m and check if it&#39;s a positive integer.But how to compute m for each case:Case1: Multiply a. New a is a*m. Condition 2b = a*m + c. Solve for m: m = (2b -c)/a. Check if (2b -c) is divisible by a, and m &gt;=1. Also, since m must be positive, 2b -c must be positive (since a is positive). So (2b -c) must be &gt;0. Otherwise, m would be &lt;=0, which is invalid.Wait, for example, if 2b -c is zero, then m is zero. Which is invalid. So in this case, m must be (2b -c)/a, which must be a positive integer. So 2b -c must be &gt;= a*1 (since m &gt;=1). Because (2b -c) must be equal to a*m, which is at least a*1. So 2b -c &gt;=a → m &gt;=1.So in this case, the conditions are:1. (2b - c) must be positive (since m is positive)2. (2b - c) must be divisible by a3. m = (2b -c)/a must be &gt;=1.Wait, but if (2b -c) is divisible by a and positive, then m is automatically &gt;=1. Because 2b -c &gt;=a *1 → m &gt;=1. Wait no. Suppose a=3, 2b -c =3. Then m=1. If a=3 and 2b -c is 3, m=1. If a=3 and 2b -c is 6, m=2. So the condition is 2b -c must be &gt;=a *1. But (2b -c) can be less than a but still positive. For example, a=5, 2b -c =3. Then m would be 3/5, which is not an integer. So in that case, even if 2b -c is positive but not divisible by a, or even if divisible but m is fractional, then it&#39;s invalid.So for case1, the steps are:Check if (2b -c) is divisible by a. If yes, then m = (2b -c)/a. Check if m is a positive integer (which would require that (2b -c) is positive, since a is positive).But how do we check if (2b -c) is positive? Because a is positive, and m must be positive, so (2b -c)/a must be positive. So (2b -c) must be positive, and a must divide it. So the two conditions are:(2b -c) &gt;0(2b -c) mod a ==0If both are true, then case1 is possible.Similarly for the other cases.Let&#39;s formalize the conditions for each case.Case 1: Multiply a by m.Conditions:- 2b - c must be &gt;0 (so that m is positive)- (2b -c) must be divisible by a- Then m = (2b -c)/a must be a positive integer (which is guaranteed by the first two conditions)Case 2: Multiply b by m.Conditions:- a + c must be even (since 2b*m must equal a + c, which is an integer)- (a +c) must be divisible by 2*b (so that m is integer)- (a +c)/(2*b) must be &gt;=1 (since m is a positive integer)But wait, (a +c) can be equal to 2b *1 → m=1. So the conditions are:(a +c) must be divisible by 2b → (a +c) mod (2b) ==0m = (a +c)/(2b) must be &gt;=1.But since a and c are positive integers, (a +c) is at least 2 (since a and c are at least 1 each). 2b could be 2*1=2. So (a +c) could be 2, leading to m=1. So the condition here is:(a + c) must be divisible by 2b, and the result is m &gt;=1.But since a and c are positive, (a +c) is positive. 2b is positive, so m is positive. But m must be &gt;=1.So (a +c) &gt;= 2b * 1 → a +c &gt;= 2b. Otherwise, m would be less than 1. So for example, if a +c = 2b *0.5, which is not possible since (a +c) must be divisible by 2b. So (a +c) must be a multiple of 2b, and that multiple must be at least 1.So, the conditions for case2 are:(a +c) % (2b) == 0and(a +c) &gt;= 2b → which is equivalent to m &gt;=1.Because if (a +c) is divisible by 2b, then m = (a +c)/(2b) must be an integer. For m to be &gt;=1, (a +c) must be &gt;= 2b*1 → (a +c) &gt;= 2b.So combining these two conditions:(a +c) is divisible by 2b and (a +c) &gt;= 2b.But (a +c) &gt;=2b is implied if (a +c) is divisible by 2b and m is a positive integer.Wait, for example, suppose (a +c) is 0. But since a and c are positive, their sum can&#39;t be zero. So m is (a +c)/(2b). Since a, c, b are positive, (a +c) is positive, and 2b is positive. So m is a positive number. But if (a +c) is less than 2b, then m would be a fraction between 0 and 1. But since m must be an integer &gt;=1, this can&#39;t happen. So to ensure that m is &gt;=1, (a +c) must be &gt;= 2b and divisible by 2b.Wait, for example, if a=1, c=1, b=1. Then (a +c) =2, 2b=2. m=1. Which is valid. So this case works. If a=3, c=1, b=2. Then (a +c)=4, 2b=4. m=1. Valid.If a=2, c=2, b=3. Then (a +c) =4, 2b=6. 4/6 = 0.666..., which is not an integer. So case2 is invalid.So for case2, the conditions are:(a +c) must be divisible by 2b, and (a +c) &gt;= 2b.But wait, if (a +c) is divisible by 2b but (a +c) is less than 2b, then m would be (a +c)/(2b) = some fraction less than 1, which is not allowed. So that&#39;s why we need to check (a +c) &gt;= 2b.But wait, let&#39;s think of a scenario where (a +c) is divisible by 2b and (a +c) is exactly 2b. Then m=1. Which is valid. So the check (a +c) &gt;= 2b is correct.So in code, for case2, we need to check if (a +c) is divisible by 2b, and (a +c) &gt;= 2b.Case3: Multiply c by m.Conditions:- 2b -a must be positive (since m is positive)- (2b -a) must be divisible by c- Then m = (2b -a)/c must be a positive integer.So, conditions:(2b -a) &gt;0(2b -a) mod c ==0So, for each of the three cases, we check these conditions. If any of the three is true, then the answer is YES.But wait, perhaps there&#39;s a scenario where after the multiplication, the sequence is an AP but with a negative difference. But the code&#39;s conditions already account for that. Because the AP can have a negative difference as long as the order is maintained.So, the code approach would be:For each test case (a, b, c):Check if any of the following is true:1. Check case1 (multiply a):   (2b - c) must be &gt;0, and (2b - c) must be divisible by a.   So, (2*b - c) &gt;0 and ( (2*b - c) % a == 0 )   Then, m = (2b - c)/a must be a positive integer. But since a is positive and (2b -c) is positive and divisible by a, m is positive.2. Check case2 (multiply b):   (a + c) must be divisible by (2*b), and (a + c) &gt;= 2*b.   So, ( (a + c) % (2*b) == 0 ) and (a + c) &gt;= 2*b.   Then, m = (a + c)/(2*b) must be an integer &gt;=1.3. Check case3 (multiply c):   (2*b - a) must be &gt;0, and (2*b -a) % c ==0.   So, (2*b -a &gt;0) and ( (2*b -a) % c == 0 )Additionally, there&#39;s another case: the original sequence is already an AP. Then, we can multiply any of the numbers by m=1 (since m can be 1), but the problem requires exactly one operation. So even if the original sequence is an AP, we have to perform the operation. Wait, the problem says, &quot;exactly once. Choose a positive integer m and multiply exactly one of the integers a, b, or c by m.&quot;So even if the original sequence is an AP, you must perform the operation once. However, if you multiply by m=1, the sequence remains the same. So in that case, it&#39;s allowed.For example, the test case 1 1 1. If you multiply any of them by m=1, the sequence remains [1,1,1], which is an AP. So the answer is YES.So, in code, even if the original sequence is an AP, we have to check if any of the three cases allows m=1. For example, in the original sequence, if it&#39;s already an AP, then for case1, case2, or case3, perhaps one of the m&#39;s is 1.Wait, let&#39;s see. Suppose a=1, b=2, c=3. Original sequence is AP. Then, for case1 (multiply a by m), the condition would be 2*2 -3 =4-3=1. a=1. So 1 is divisible by 1, m=1. So case1 is possible. So the answer is YES. So the code will handle this case.But what if the original sequence is already an AP but we have to perform the operation? For example, the third test case in the examples is 1 2 3. The original is already an AP. But the code will check case1: 2*2 -3=4-3=1. a=1. 1 is divisible by 1 → m=1. So yes.So the code will correctly return YES for such cases.Another example: the input is 1 1 1. Then, any of the three cases would have m=1, which is allowed. So the answer is YES.So the code doesn&#39;t need to handle the original AP case separately. It&#39;s already covered by the three cases.Now, let&#39;s code this logic.The steps for each test case:Read a, b, c.Check case1: if (2*b - c) &gt; 0 and (2*b -c) % a == 0 → yes.Check case2: if (a + c) is divisible by 2*b and (a +c) &gt;= 2*b → yes.Check case3: if (2*b -a) &gt;0 and (2*b -a) % c ==0 → yes.If any of the three cases is true, output YES. Else, NO.But wait, the case2 check also includes (a +c) &gt;= 2*b. But since a and c are positive, (a +c) can be as small as 2 (if a and c are 1 each). So, for example, if a=1, c=1, b=1. Then (a +c) is 2, 2*b is 2. So 2 is divisible by 2, and 2 &gt;=2 → m=1. So case2 is valid. So the code correctly returns YES.Another example: in the fifth test case from the example (input 2 6 3):Check case1:2b -c = 12 -3 =9. a=2. 9 mod 2 is 1 → not divisible. So case1 invalid.Case2: a +c=5, 2b=12. 5 mod 12 is 5, not divisible. So invalid.Case3: 2b -a =12-2=10. c=3. 10 mod3 is 1 → invalid. So all cases invalid. Output NO.Another example: test case 4 (input 1 6 3). Check case1:2b -c =12-3=9. a=1. 9 mod1=0 → valid. So case1 is yes. So output yes.So the code seems to handle all cases.Now, code in Python:Read t test cases. For each, read a, b, c. Check the three conditions.But in code:Case1:We need to check if (2*b - c) is divisible by a, and (2*b -c) is positive. Also, (2*b -c) must be &gt;=a*1 (since m is (2b -c)/a, which must be &gt;=1). Wait, no. Because m is (2b -c)/a. For m to be at least 1, (2b -c) &gt;=a. But if (2b -c) is a multiple of a, but less than a, then (2b -c)/a would be a fraction. For example, if a=5, 2b -c=3. Then 3 is not divisible by 5. So in code, when we check (2b -c) %a ==0, this would return false. So the code is safe.Wait, if (2b -c) is positive and divisible by a, then (2b -c)/a is a positive integer. So regardless of whether (2b -c) is &gt;=a or not, as long as it&#39;s positive and divisible, m is valid.Wait, for example, a=3, 2b -c=3. Then m=1. If a=3, 2b -c=6 → m=2. Both are valid. So in code, for case1, the check is (2b -c) &gt;0 and (2b -c) %a ==0. Because m can be 1 or larger.So the code for case1 is:case1 = (2 * b - c) &gt; 0 and (2 * b - c) % a == 0Similarly for case3:case3 = (2 * b - a) &gt; 0 and (2 * b - a) % c == 0For case2:case2 = ( (a + c) % (2 * b) == 0 ) and ( (a + c) // (2 * b) &gt;= 1 )But wait, (a +c) must be divisible by 2*b, and the quotient (m) must be &gt;=1.But (a +c) must be &gt;= 2*b *1, because m is (a +c)/(2*b), which must be &gt;=1. So (a +c) must be &gt;= 2*b.But since (a +c) is divisible by 2*b, (a +c) can be 2*b *k, where k is a positive integer. So (a +c) &gt;= 2*b *1 → k &gt;=1. So (a +c) &gt;= 2*b.Thus, in code, for case2:if (a + c) is divisible by 2*b → then m = (a +c)/(2*b). We need m &gt;=1, which is equivalent to (a +c) &gt;=2*b.So case2 is ( (a + c) % (2 * b) == 0 ) and ( (a + c) &gt;= 2 * b )But in code, (a + c) can be written as (a + c) &gt;= 2*b. So:case2 = ( (a + c) % (2 * b) == 0 ) and ( (a + c) &gt;= 2 * b )But wait, even if (a +c) is divisible by 2*b but (a +c) is less than 2*b, then m would be less than 1, which is invalid. But in that case, since (a +c) is divisible by 2*b, (a +c) must be 2*b *k where k is a positive integer. So (a +c) can&#39;t be less than 2*b if k is &gt;=1. Wait, no. For example, 2*b*k could be less than 2*b only if k is less than 1. But k must be a positive integer (since (a +c) is a multiple of 2*b). So k can be 0. But (a +c) is positive, so k can&#39;t be zero. So k &gt;=1. So (a +c) = 2*b *k &gt;= 2*b *1 → (a +c) &gt;=2*b. So in this case, the condition (a +c) &gt;=2*b is automatically satisfied if (a +c) is divisible by 2*b. So the code for case2 can omit the (a +c) &gt;=2*b check.Wait, no. For example, if (a +c) =2*b *k. Since k is an integer (since (a +c) is divisible by 2*b), and (a +c) is positive, k must be a positive integer (because 2*b is positive). So k &gt;=1. So (a +c) = 2*b *k &gt;= 2*b. So the (a +c) &gt;=2*b check is redundant. So in code, case2 can just check if (a +c) is divisible by 2*b. Because if that&#39;s true, then (a +c) must be &gt;=2*b (since k is at least 1). So the code for case2 is:case2 = ( (a + c) % (2 * b) == 0 )But wait, let&#39;s test this with an example.If a=1, c=1, b=1. Then (a +c) =2, 2*b=2. So 2 is divisible by 2. m=1 → valid.If a=2, c=2, b=2. Then (a +c)=4, 2*b=4. 4 is divisible by 4. m=1 → valid.If a=3, c=5, b=2. Then (a +c)=8, 2*b=4. 8 is divisible by 4 → m=2. Which is valid.If a=3, c=3, b=3 → (a +c)=6, 2*b=6 → m=1. Valid.Another example: a=1, c=3, b=2. Then (a +c)=4, 2*b=4. So case2 is true. m=1. So the new b is 2*1=2. The sequence becomes 1,2,3. Which is an AP. So correct.But what if (a +c) is 0? But since a and c are positive, their sum is positive. So code is safe.Wait, but what if a=1, c=3, and b=3. Then (a +c)=4, 2*b=6. 4 mod6 is 4. So case2 is invalid. So code works.Thus, in code, case2 is checked as (a +c) % (2*b) ==0. Because if (a +c) is divisible by 2*b, then m is (a +c)/(2*b), which is a positive integer &gt;=1.So the code can be written as:For each test case:a, b, c = map(int, input().split())valid = False# case1: multiply a by mif (2*b - c) &gt; 0 and (2*b - c) % a ==0:    valid = True# case2: multiply b by melif (a + c) % (2*b) ==0:    valid = True# case3: multiply c by melif (2*b -a) &gt;0 and (2*b -a) %c ==0:    valid = Trueelse:    # check other possibilities?Wait, but the code as written uses &#39;elif&#39; which means if one case is valid, the others are not checked. But there could be multiple cases that are valid. But since we only need one valid case to return YES, the code can return True as soon as any case is valid.But wait, the code as written here is incorrect. Because &#39;elif&#39; means that if case1 is True, it won&#39;t check case2 or case3. But maybe case2 is also True, but it&#39;s not needed. But the code only needs to check if any of the cases is True, regardless of order.But in the code, the &#39;elif&#39;s are not correct. The code should check all three cases and if any of them is True, then output YES.So in code:valid = False# Check case1if (2*b - c) &gt; 0 and (2*b - c) % a == 0:    valid = True# Check case2if not valid and ( (a + c) % (2*b) ==0 ):    valid = True# Check case3if not valid and (2*b -a) &gt;0 and (2*b -a) % c ==0:    valid = TrueBut this can be written as:valid = (case1) or (case2) or (case3)So code can be:case1 = (2*b - c) &gt; 0 and ((2*b - c) % a == 0)case2 = ( (a + c) % (2*b) == 0 )case3 = (2*b -a) &gt;0 and ((2*b -a) % c ==0)valid = case1 or case2 or case3But wait, this could allow case2 even if (a +c) is zero. But since a and c are positive, their sum is positive, so (a +c) can&#39;t be zero.So in code, for each case, compute the three conditions and see if any is True.So, the code will:for each test case:a, b, c = ... case1 = (2*b - c) &gt; 0 and ( (2*b - c) % a == 0 )case2 = ( (a + c) % (2*b) ) == 0 case3 = (2*b - a) &gt;0 and ( (2*b -a) % c == 0 )if case1 or case2 or case3:    print(&quot;YES&quot;)else:    print(&quot;NO&quot;)But wait, there&#39;s another possibility: multiplying one of the numbers and the other two being part of the AP. For example, perhaps a=1, b=3, c=5. Original sequence is AP. So multiply a by m=1. Then the sequence is still [1,3,5], which is AP. So case1 is (2*3 -5) =1. 1&gt;0 and 1%1 ==0. So case1 is true. So code works.But let&#39;s see another scenario where the original sequence is not an AP, but after multiplying one of them, it becomes an AP.Another example: a=1, b=3, c=4. Original sequence is 1,3,4. Not AP. Let&#39;s check case1:2*3 -4=2. a=1. 2%1=0. So case1 is true. So multiply a by m=2. New a=2. Sequence becomes 2,3,4. Which is AP. Correct.So code works.Another example: a=9, b=6, c=3. Original sequence is AP. If we check case1: 2*6-3=9. 9%9=0 → case1 is true. So code returns YES. Which is correct.Now, let&#39;s test the example from the problem.Sample Input 5:2 6 3 → Output NO.Case1: 2*6 -3 =9. 9 mod 2 is 1 → invalid.Case2: (2 +3) =5. 5 mod (2*6) →5 mod12=5 → invalid.Case3: 2*6 -2=10. 10 mod3=1 → invalid. So all cases invalid. Output NO. Correct.Sample Input 1: 10 5 30.Case2: a +c=40. 2*b=10. 40 mod10=0 → case2 is true. So code returns YES. Because m=40/(2*5)=4. So multiply b by 4. New sequence is 10, 20,30 → AP. Correct.But wait, in the sample input 1, the code would have case2 as true. Let&#39;s compute:a=10, b=5, c=30. a +c=40. 2*b=10. 40 mod10=0 → yes. So case2 is true. So code returns YES.Yes.Another sample input is the fourth test case: 1 6 3. The code checks case1: 2*6 -3=9. a=1. 9%1=0 → yes. So case1 is true. So code returns YES.So the code works.Now, let&#39;s check the third example input: 1 2 3. The original sequence is AP. So code returns YES because case1: (2*2 -3) =1. 1%1=0 → yes. So case1 is true. Correct.So the code seems to handle all the sample cases correctly.Now, code for this problem.We need to read t test cases, then for each, output YES or NO based on the conditions.But in Python, for handling large input, using sys.stdin is better. Since t can be up to 1e4, but that&#39;s manageable.So the code:Read t. Then for each of t lines, read a, b, c.Then compute case1, case2, case3.If any is true, output YES, else NO.Now, implement this.But wait, there&#39;s a possible division by zero in case2 if 2*b is zero. But since the constraints state that a, b, c are positive integers, 2*b can&#39;t be zero. So no division by zero.So code can be written as:import syst = int(sys.stdin.readline())for _ in range(t):    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())    case1 = False    if (2*b - c) &gt; 0:        if (2*b - c) % a == 0:            case1 = True    case2 = ( (a + c) % (2*b) == 0 )    case3 = False    if (2*b - a) &gt; 0:        if (2*b - a) % c == 0:            case3 = True    if case1 or case2 or case3:        print(&quot;YES&quot;)    else:        print(&quot;NO&quot;)But wait, in case2, we need to check (a +c) is divisible by 2*b, but what if 2*b is zero? But since b is a positive integer (per input constraints), 2*b is at least 2. So no division by zero.But in code, for case2, (a + c) % (2*b) is zero.Now, testing the sample input where case2 is true.Another example: a=30, b=5, c=10 (second sample input). The code should return YES. Let&#39;s see:case1: 2*5 -10 =0 → not positive. So no.case2: 30+10=40. 2*5=10. 40 mod10=0 → case2 is true. So code returns YES. Correct.But wait, the sample input for this case says multiplying b by 4 gives 30, 20, 10. Which is an AP with difference -10. So 2*b*m =30 +10 → 2*5*m=40 → m=4. So yes. So case2 is valid.So code is correct.Another example: test case where case3 is valid. For example, a=1, b=3, c=5. Then case3: 2*3 -1=5. 5%5=0 → case3 is true. So multiply c by m=1. The sequence is 1,3,5 → which is AP. So code returns YES.Another test case where multiplying c gives valid AP. For example, a=2, b=3, c=1. Original sequence is 2,3,1. Not AP. Let&#39;s see case3: 2*3 -2=4. 4 must be divisible by c=1. 4%1=0. So case3 is true. m=4/1=4. Multiply c by 4 → new sequence 2,3,4. Which is AP. So code returns YES.Thus, the code works.Now, let&#39;s verify the sample input 7:Sample input 7: 1 1 2 → output is NO.Check the cases:case1: 2*1 -2=0 → not positive. So no.case2: (1+2) mod (2*1) =3 mod2=1 → no.case3: 2*1 -1=1. 1 mod2=1 → no. So all cases invalid → output NO. Correct.Sample input 8: 1 1 3 → output YES.Check cases:case1: 2*1 -3= -1 → not positive. No.case2: (1+3) mod 2*1=4 mod2=0 → yes. So case2 is true. m=4/2=2. Multiply b by 2 → new sequence is 1, 2,3 → AP. Correct. So code returns YES.Sample input 9: 1 100000000 1 → output YES.Check case3: 2*1e8 -1= 199999999. 199999999 must be divisible by c=1. Which it is. So case3 is true. m=199999999 → multiply c (which is 1) by 199999999. New sequence is 1,1e8, 199999999. Check if it&#39;s AP. 1e8 -1 = 99999999. 199999999-1e8 = 99999999. So yes. Correct.Thus, the code should handle all cases.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can transform three given integers (a), (b), and (c) into an arithmetic progression (AP) by multiplying exactly one of them by a positive integer (m). The solution involves checking three possible scenarios where each of the integers (a), (b), or (c) is multiplied by (m) to form an AP. Approach1. Case 1: Multiply (a) by (m):   - After multiplying (a) by (m), the sequence becomes (a cdot m, b, c). For this to be an AP, the condition (2b = a cdot m + c) must hold. We check if (2b - c) is positive and divisible by (a).2. Case 2: Multiply (b) by (m):   - After multiplying (b) by (m), the sequence becomes (a, b cdot m, c). For this to be an AP, the condition (2(b cdot m) = a + c) must hold. We check if (a + c) is divisible by (2b).3. Case 3: Multiply (c) by (m):   - After multiplying (c) by (m), the sequence becomes (a, b, c cdot m). For this to be an AP, the condition (2b = a + c cdot m) must hold. We check if (2b - a) is positive and divisible by (c). Solution Code```pythonimport sysdef can_form_ap(a, b, c):    # Case 1: Multiply a by m    case1 = False    numerator = 2 * b - c    if numerator &gt; 0 and numerator % a == 0:        case1 = True        # Case 2: Multiply b by m    case2 = False    sum_ac = a + c    denominator_2b = 2 * b    if sum_ac % denominator_2b == 0:        case2 = True        # Case 3: Multiply c by m    case3 = False    numerator3 = 2 * b - a    if numerator3 &gt; 0 and numerator3 % c == 0:        case3 = True        return case1 or case2 or case3t = int(sys.stdin.readline())for _ in range(t):    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())    if can_form_ap(a, b, c):        print(&quot;YES&quot;)    else:        print(&quot;NO&quot;)``` ExplanationThe solution checks each of the three possible cases where one of the integers (a), (b), or (c) is multiplied by a positive integer (m) to form an arithmetic progression. The checks are performed using modular arithmetic to ensure divisibility and positivity of the resulting values. If any of the cases are valid, the answer is &quot;YES&quot;; otherwise, it is &quot;NO&quot;. This approach efficiently handles up to (10^4) test cases with integers up to (10^8).</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ef989c89 data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review" data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review-title" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>❓:</span>Madoka decided to participate in an underground sports programming competition.

Let&#39;s read the problem carefully.The task is to generate an n x n grid that&#39;s &quot;good&quot; according to certain rules. The grid must have the minimum possible number of &#39;X&#39;s, and the cell (r, c) must be &#39;X&#39;. The definition of a &quot;good&quot; table is that every 1xk or kx1 subtable (so every consecutive k cells in a row or column) has at least one &#39;X&#39;. Since n is a multiple of k, that&#39;s helpful because it divides the grid into blocks of size k. Wait, maybe not. But n being a multiple of k ensures that the entire grid can be divided into k-sized chunks in each row and column without leftovers. That might be useful for structuring the X placements.The goal is to find a pattern that covers all required k-length sequences with minimal X&#39;s. Also, the given (r, c) must be an X.Hmm. Let&#39;s think about how to arrange X&#39;s. For each row, we need that every k consecutive cells have at least one X. Similarly for each column. To minimize the number of X&#39;s, the optimal way would be to place X&#39;s at intervals that just meet the requirement. For example, in a row, placing an X every k cells. But wait, that&#39;s exactly k-1 cells between Xs. Because if you have X at positions 1, k+1, 2k+1, etc., then each k-length window would have exactly one X. Because each window of k cells would start at some position between 1 and k, and the next X is at k+1. Wait, maybe that&#39;s the case. Let&#39;s see: for a row of length n=3k, placing X every k cells. For example, positions 1, k+1, 2k+1. Then each k-length window would include exactly one X. Because the first window (positions 1 to k) has X at 1. The next window (2 to k+1) has X at k+1. And so on. So that would work for rows. Similarly for columns.But how to arrange this such that the (r,c) cell is an X, and the pattern meets the constraints.But how to structure the grid so that both rows and columns satisfy their conditions. Because if we arrange the X&#39;s in rows with a period of k, then the columns might not satisfy their conditions. For example, if each row has X&#39;s every k cells, but the columns could have consecutive k cells without any X. So this approach might not work for both rows and columns.So perhaps we need a grid that has a certain repeating pattern that covers both row and column constraints.Another thought: perhaps arrange X&#39;s in a diagonal pattern. Like, in each block of k x k cells, place X&#39;s in a diagonal, such that each row and column in the block has exactly one X. Then, when tiled across the grid, this would ensure that every k consecutive cells in any row or column have at least one X.Wait, but the problem allows n to be any multiple of k, not just k. So n could be 2k, 3k, etc. So the grid is divided into (n/k) x (n/k) blocks of size k x k each. Then, in each block, arrange X&#39;s such that each row and column of the block has exactly one X. For example, a diagonal. But that way, each row in the entire grid would have X every k steps. Similarly for columns. Then, for any consecutive k cells in a row, there is exactly one X. So that would satisfy the condition. Similarly for columns.But how to ensure that the (r, c) cell is an X in this setup. So the pattern would have X&#39;s at positions that form a diagonal in each k x k block. For example, in each block, the X is at (i, (i + s) mod k) for some shift s. Then, varying s across blocks could create a larger pattern.Wait, perhaps the entire grid is filled with a periodic pattern where each k x k block has X&#39;s in a certain diagonal, and the shift between blocks is such that the entire pattern is consistent.Alternatively, arrange the X&#39;s in a way that in every row, the X&#39;s are spaced exactly k apart, and similarly for columns. That way, any k consecutive cells in a row or column would have exactly one X. But how to arrange this in two dimensions.Let me think of an example. Take the first sample input:Test case 1:n=3, k=3. So the grid is 3x3. The required cell is (3,2). The output is:X....X.X.Which has X&#39;s at (1,1), (2,3), (3,2). Each row and column has one X. So in each row, the X is placed at different positions. For the columns, similarly. But since k=3, each row and column must have exactly one X, which satisfies the condition (since each 3 cells have exactly one X). So this is the minimal arrangement.Another sample input is the second one where k=1. So every cell must be X. Because each 1x1 subtable must have an X. So all X&#39;s.The third sample input is 6x6, k=3. The output has a pattern where every 3 cells in a row and column have X. Looking at the output, it seems that the X&#39;s are placed in a diagonal pattern across each 3x3 block, but the blocks are arranged such that the pattern shifts. For example, the first three rows:.X..X.X..X....X..XEach row starts with an X at position 2, then next X at 5 (if you count from 1). Wait, but 6 columns, so perhaps the pattern is that in each 3x3 block, the X is placed at a certain diagonal, but the shift alternates between blocks.Wait, perhaps the approach is to arrange X&#39;s such that in each row, the X&#39;s are placed every k steps, but shifted in a way that each column also has X&#39;s every k steps. So for example, for a row, X&#39;s are at positions s, s +k, s +2k, etc. For the columns, each X in a column is at positions t, t +k, etc. But how to arrange this in a grid so that both row and column conditions are satisfied.Alternatively, think of the problem as a grid where each cell (i,j) is an X if and only if (i + j) mod k == m for some m. But how to choose m such that all consecutive k cells in any row or column have at least one X.Wait, let&#39;s take k=3. If we set X&#39;s at positions where (i + j) mod 3 == 0. Then, in a row, consecutive 3 cells would have at least one X. For example, in row i, j varies. So for any consecutive 3 cells, their (i+j) mod 3 would be 0, 1, 2, so one of them must be 0. So that would work for rows. Similarly, in columns, consecutive 3 cells would have their (i+j) mod 3 varying, so at least one is 0. So this would satisfy the conditions.But then, the total number of X&#39;s is (n^2)/k. Because for each row, there are n/k X&#39;s. So total n*(n/k) = n²/k. But is this the minimal possible? Because each row requires at least n/k X&#39;s (since each X covers k consecutive cells). So for rows, the minimal is n²/k. But the columns may require more. Wait, no. Because if we arrange X&#39;s such that each X covers both a row and column requirement. So perhaps this is the minimal.So in this arrangement, each X is part of both a row and column&#39;s k-length windows. So the minimal total X&#39;s would be n²/k, which is possible if the X&#39;s are arranged in a way that each X covers exactly k cells in its row and column. But maybe this is only possible when the arrangement satisfies both row and column constraints.So using this approach, we can generate a grid where (i + j) mod k == m. Then, m is a value between 0 and k-1. But how to choose m such that (r-1) + (c-1) mod k == m (since the cell (r, c) is 1-based). So m = (r-1 + c-1) mod k. Then, the X&#39;s are placed at positions where (i + j) mod k == m. Then, this ensures that (r-1, c-1) (0-based) is part of the X&#39;s.Wait, because in the grid, rows and columns are 1-based. So for the cell (r, c) in 1-based, the 0-based coordinates are (r-1, c-1). Then, (r-1 + c-1) mod k = (r + c - 2) mod k. So m is (r + c - 2) mod k. Then, all cells (i, j) where (i + j) mod k == m will be X&#39;s. Then, this will include the required cell (r-1, c-1).But does this arrangement satisfy the problem&#39;s constraints?Let&#39;s test with sample input 1:Test case 1: n=3, k=3, r=3, c=2.So 0-based r-1=2, c-1=1. So m=(2+1) mod 3 = 3 mod 3 =0. So all cells where (i +j) mod 3 ==0.So cell (0,0) (0+0=0 mod3=0) → X.(0,1): 0+1=1 mod3 → . (0,2):0+2=2 → . Row 0 (1-based row 1) is X.. → correct.Row 1 (0-based i=1):j=0:1+0=1 mod3 → . j=1:2 → . j=2:3 mod3=0 → X.So row 1 is ..X → correct.Row 2 (i=2):j=0:2+0=2 → . j=1:3 mod3=0 → X.j=2:4 mod3=1 → . So row 2 is .X. → correct.Which matches the first sample. So this arrangement works.Another sample: test case 3.n=6, k=3, r=4, c=2.r-1=3, c-1=1. So m=3+1=4 mod3=1.So all cells where (i +j) mod3=1.So the X&#39;s are in positions where i+j ≡1 mod3.Let&#39;s see how the output would look.Each cell (i,j) in 0-based.For i from 0 to 5 (rows 1-6), j from 0 to5.Looking for i+j mod3 =1.Let&#39;s look at each row:Row 0 (i=0):j=1: 0+1=1 → X.j=4: 0+4=4 mod3=1 → X.So row 0: .X..X. → correct as per sample.Row 1 (i=1):j=0:1+0=1 → X.j=3:1+3=4 mod3=1 → X.So row 1: X..X.. → correct.Row 2 (i=2):j=2:2+2=4 mod3=1 → X.j=5:2+5=7 mod3=1 → X.So row 2: ..X..X → correct.Row 3 (i=3):j=1:3+1=4 mod3=1 → X.j=4:3+4=7 mod3=1 → X.Row3: .X..X. → sample&#39;s fourth line is .X..X. → yes.Row4 (i=4):j=0:4+0=4 mod3=1 → X.j=3:4+3=7 mod3=1 → X.Row4: X..X.. → sample&#39;s fifth line is X..X.. → correct.Row5 (i=5):j=2:5+2=7 mod3=1 → X.j=5:5+5=10 mod3=1 → X.Row5: ..X..X → sample&#39;s sixth line is ..X..X → correct.So the sample&#39;s third case output is as per this arrangement. So this approach seems correct.Now, what about when k is not equal to n? For example, test case 2 where k=1, n=2. Then m = (1-1 +2-1) mod1 = (0+1) mod1=1 mod1=0. So all cells where (i +j) mod1=0. But mod1 of any number is 0, so all cells are X. Which matches the second sample&#39;s output.So this approach seems to work.So the plan is:For each test case:1. Compute m = (r-1 + c-1) mod k → (r-1 + c-1) is 0-based coordinates sum.2. For each cell (i, j) in the grid (0-based), check if (i + j) mod k == m. If yes, put &#39;X&#39;, else &#39;.&#39;.3. Ensure that this arrangement has the minimal possible X&#39;s, and meets the required constraints.But why is this arrangement valid and minimal?Validity: For any row, the X&#39;s are placed every k steps. Because in a row, j increases by 1 each step, so for each consecutive k cells, (i + j) mod k will take all values from 0 to k-1. So in any consecutive k cells in a row, there&#39;s exactly one that satisfies (i +j) modk =m, hence an X. So the row condition is satisfied. Similarly, for columns. In a column, i increases by 1 each step. For consecutive k cells, (i +j) modk will cycle through m+0, m+1, ... m +k-1 (modk). So again, one of them will hit m. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think: for a column j, and consecutive k cells i, i+1, ..., i+k-1. The sum (i +j), (i+1 +j), ... (i+k-1 +j) → each increases by 1. So modk, the sums are (i+j) modk, (i+j+1) modk, ..., (i+j +k-1) modk. These are all distinct. So exactly one of them will be equal to m. So each column&#39;s consecutive k cells have exactly one X, which satisfies the condition. Hence, the arrangement is valid.Minimality: Each row has exactly n/k X&#39;s (since in a row of n elements, the X&#39;s are placed every k steps). So total X&#39;s is n*(n/k) = n²/k. Similarly, each column also has exactly n/k X&#39;s. So the total is n²/k. Since each row must have at least n/k X&#39;s (each X can cover at most k consecutive cells), the minimal possible is when each row has exactly n/k X&#39;s. So this arrangement is minimal.Thus, this approach is correct.So the steps to code are:For each test case:- Read n, k, r, c.- Compute m = (r-1 + c-1) % k → since (r-1, c-1) is the 0-based cell.- Then, for each row i (0-based), and each column j (0-based), check if (i + j) %k == m. If yes, output &#39;X&#39;, else &#39;.&#39;.But wait, in the sample input 3, the required cell is (4,2) (1-based), which is (3,1) 0-based. (3+1) =4 mod3=1. So m=1. And the X&#39;s are where (i+j) mod3=1. Correct.So this approach works.Now, code-wise, how to generate this.In Python:Read t test cases.For each test case:n, k, r, c = map(int, input().split())Compute m = (r-1 + c-1) % k.Then, for each i in 0..n-1:row = []for j in 0..n-1:if (i + j) %k == m:append &#39;X&#39;else:append &#39;.&#39;.print(&#39;&#39;.join(row))But why is this correct? Because the required cell (r-1, c-1) is (r-1) + (c-1) = m modk. So (i +j) modk ==m includes that cell. So the required cell is X.Yes.So the code would work for all test cases.Testing the first sample:Test case 1: n=3, k=3, r=3, c=2.r-1=2, c-1=1. m=3 mod3=0.So for i=0, j=0 → 0 mod3=0 → X.i=0, j=1 →1 → no.i=0, j=2 →2 → no.So first row is X.. → correct.i=1, j=0 →1 → no. j=1 →2 → no. j=2 →3 mod3=0 → X. So ..X.i=2, j=0 →2 → no. j=1 →3 mod3=0 → X. j=2 →4 mod3=1 → no. So .X. → correct.Which matches the sample.The code seems correct.Another test case: when k=1. Then m is (r-1 + c-1) mod1=0. So all cells must be X. Which matches the second sample.Third test case:n=6, k=3, r=4, c=2.r-1=3, c-1=1. 3+1=4 mod3=1.So each cell (i, j) where i+j mod3=1. Which gives the pattern as in the sample.So the code is correct.Now, implement this in Python. Read t test cases. For each, generate the grid as described.Then, print each row as a string.So the code would be:t = int(input())for _ in range(t):    n, k, r, c = map(int, input().split())    m = (r-1 + c-1) % k    for i in range(n):        row = []        for j in range(n):            if (i + j) % k == m:                row.append(&#39;X&#39;)            else:                row.append(&#39;.&#39;)        print(&#39;&#39;.join(row))But wait, the third sample&#39;s output for the third test case is:.X..X.X..X....X..X.X..X.X..X....X..XWhich is exactly what this code produces. Let&#39;s check:n=6, k=3, m=1.For i=0 (row 1):j=0 →0 →0+0=0 mod3=0 !=1 →.j=1 →1 →0+1=1 mod3=1 →X.j=2 →2 →0+2=2 →.j=3 →3 →0+3=3 mod3=0 →.j=4 →4 →0+4=4 mod3=1 →X.j=5 →5 →0+5=5 mod3=2 →.So the first row is .X..X. → correct.Similarly, i=1 (row 2):j=0:1+0=1 mod3=1 →X.j=1:1+1=2 →.j=2:1+2=3 mod3=0 →.j=3:1+3=4 mod3=1 →X.So row is X..X.. → correct.Yes, this code works.Thus, this approach is correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to generate an n x n grid that satisfies specific constraints while minimizing the number of &#39;X&#39; characters. The grid must be structured such that every 1xk or kx1 subtable contains at least one &#39;X&#39;, and a given cell (r, c) must contain an &#39;X&#39;. ApproachThe key insight is to place &#39;X&#39; characters in a diagonal pattern across the grid. This pattern ensures that every consecutive k cells in any row or column contain at least one &#39;X&#39;. The diagonal pattern is determined based on the given cell (r, c) to ensure it includes this cell.1. Determine the Diagonal Offset: Calculate the offset `m` using the given cell (r, c) in 0-based indices. This offset is computed as `(r-1 + c-1) % k`.2. Generate the Grid: For each cell (i, j) in the grid, place an &#39;X&#39; if `(i + j) % k` equals the computed offset `m`. This creates a diagonal pattern that repeats every k cells, ensuring the constraints are met. Solution Code```pythont = int(input())for _ in range(t):    n, k, r, c = map(int, input().split())    m = (r - 1 + c - 1) % k    for i in range(n):        row = []        for j in range(n):            if (i + j) % k == m:                row.append(&#39;X&#39;)            else:                row.append(&#39;.&#39;)        print(&#39;&#39;.join(row))``` Explanation- Diagonal Pattern: The &#39;X&#39; characters are placed such that they form a diagonal pattern across the grid. This pattern ensures that every consecutive k cells in any row or column will contain at least one &#39;X&#39;.- Offset Calculation: The offset `m` is calculated using the given cell (r, c) to ensure this cell is part of the diagonal pattern.- Efficiency: The grid is generated in O(n^2) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints (sum of n over all test cases ≤ 500).This approach ensures the minimal number of &#39;X&#39; characters while meeting all problem constraints, providing an optimal and efficient solution.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ef989c89 data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review" data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review-title" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>❓:</span>You are working in the HR department of a huge corporation. Each employee may have several direct managers and/or several direct subordinates. Of course, his subordinates may also have their own subordinates, and his direct managers may have their own managers. We say employee X is a boss of employee Y if there exists a sequence of employees A, B, ..., D, such that X is the manager of A, A is the manager of B, and so on, and D is the manager of Y (of course, if X is a direct manager of employee Y, X will be a boss of employee Y). If A is a boss of B, then B can not be a boss of A. According to the new company policy, the salary of an employee with no subordinates is 1. If an employee has any subordinates, then his salary is equal to the sum of the salaries of his direct subordinates.You will be given a String[] relations, where the j-th character of the i-th element is &#39;Y&#39; if employee i is a direct manager of employee j, and &#39;N&#39; otherwise. Find the sum of the salaries of all the employees.Input:The first line of the input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10), the number of test cases. The T test cases follow.

So, the task is to compute the sum of salaries for all employees based on their hierarchy. Hmm. Let me think through the problem step by step.First, the salary calculation rules. Employees with no subordinates get a salary of 1. If they have subordinates, their salary is the sum of their direct subordinates&#39; salaries. Wait, but that&#39;s recursive. Because each subordinate&#39;s salary might depend on their own subordinates. So we need to process the employees in an order where all their subordinates have already been processed. That way, when we calculate a manager&#39;s salary, the subordinates&#39; salaries are already known.So the hierarchy here is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) since if A is a boss of B, B can&#39;t be a boss of A. So there are no cycles. Therefore, the structure forms a DAG, and we can perform a topological sort on it. Processing the employees in reverse topological order (starting from those with no subordinates, then moving up) makes sense here.Wait, how to model the relations? Each employee can have multiple direct managers. But the salary calculation is based on their direct subordinates. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the salary of an employee is the sum of the salaries of their direct subordinates. Wait, direct subordinates. So if employee X is a direct manager of Y, then Y is a direct subordinate of X. So each employee&#39;s salary is the sum of the salaries of their direct reports (subordinates).So first, for each employee, we need to find all their direct subordinates. That&#39;s given by the input. For example, in the sample input, employee 0&#39;s string is &#39;NNYN&#39;. So for j=0,1,2,3, the j-th character indicates if employee 0 is a direct manager of j. Wait, the i-th element is the string for employee i. So for employee i, the j-th character in their string is &#39;Y&#39; if i is a direct manager of j. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: &quot;the j-th character of the i-th element is &#39;Y&#39; if employee i is a direct manager of employee j&quot;. So for the i-th employee, their direct subordinates are those j where the j-th character in their string is &#39;Y&#39;? Wait, no. Wait, employee i is the manager of j if the j-th character in the i-th string is &#39;Y&#39;. So for each j, the managers are the i&#39;s where relations[i][j] is &#39;Y&#39;. But for the purposes of calculating salary, each employee&#39;s direct subordinates are those j where the i-th employee is a direct manager of j. Wait, no. Let me clarify.If i is a direct manager of j, that means j is a subordinate of i. So for employee i, the direct subordinates are all j where relations[i][j] is &#39;Y&#39;. Because i is a manager of j, so j is a direct subordinate of i. So for each i, we can collect all j where relations[i][j] is &#39;Y&#39;. Those are the direct subordinates of i. Then, the salary of i is the sum of the salaries of those j&#39;s.But for the salary calculation, the order matters. Because to compute i&#39;s salary, we need the salaries of all j&#39;s (subordinates) already calculated. So we need to process employees in such an order that all their subordinates are processed before them. That sounds like a post-order traversal of the hierarchy. So, topological order where each node comes after all its dependencies (subordinates).So the steps would be:1. For each test case, read the relations matrix.2. For each employee i, collect their direct subordinates j where relations[i][j] is &#39;Y&#39;.3. Compute the salary for each employee. The salary for i is 1 if they have no subordinates. Otherwise, sum the salaries of their direct subordinates.4. Sum all the salaries.The challenge is to compute the salaries efficiently. Since the dependencies form a DAG, processing in topological order (from leaves up) would work. Because each employee&#39;s salary depends only on their direct subordinates, which are processed before them.So how to perform this topological sort?Alternatively, since each node&#39;s salary is the sum of its children&#39;s salaries (if any children), and the base case is when there are no children (salary 1), we can memoize the salaries. But memoization in a DAG is okay here, because each node&#39;s salary is computed once based on its children.Wait, but in this case, each employee&#39;s salary is determined solely by their direct subordinates. So we can compute it via dynamic programming, where for each employee, once all their subordinates are processed, we can compute their salary.So the approach is:- For each employee, if they have no direct subordinates, their salary is 1.- Otherwise, sum the salaries of their direct subordinates.But this is recursive. For example, if employee A has subordinates B and C. B has subordinates D and E. Then, to compute A&#39;s salary, we need B and C&#39;s salaries. B&#39;s salary is sum of D and E, which are leaves (salary 1 each), so B&#39;s salary is 2. C&#39;s salary is 1 if he has no subordinates. Then A&#39;s salary is 2 + 1 = 3, etc.So the correct order to process employees is from the leaves up. So topological order where each node comes after all of its subordinates.So how to find such an order?We can model this as a graph where each edge is from subordinate to manager. Because if j is a subordinate of i (i is a direct manager of j), then j must be processed before i. So the edge would be j -&gt; i. Then, a topological sort of this graph would arrange nodes in an order where all dependents (managers) come after their prerequisites (subordinates).Wait, wait. Let me think: if i is a manager of j, then j is a subordinate of i. So j is a direct subordinate of i. So when calculating i&#39;s salary, we need j&#39;s salary. So j must be processed before i. So the edge is from j to i. Because j must come before i in the topological order. So the dependencies are: i depends on j. So j must be processed before i.Wait, no. Because the salary of i depends on j. So when processing i, we need j&#39;s salary. So j must be processed before i. So in the graph, there&#39;s an edge from j to i. So the order is j before i. Therefore, the correct topological order is the reverse of processing the dependencies. So in the graph where each edge j -&gt; i represents that j must come before i, the topological sort would arrange the nodes in such order.So the steps to process the nodes would be in reverse topological order. Wait, no. The topological order is an order where all dependencies are processed before. So if the graph has edges j -&gt; i, then in the topological order, j comes before i. So when processing in the order of the topological sort, when we reach i, all j (subordinates) have been processed. Therefore, when calculating salary[i], the salaries of j are already known.So the plan is:1. For each employee i, collect all j where relations[i][j] == &#39;Y&#39; (direct subordinates j of i).2. For each i, the salary[i] is sum of salary[j] for each j in subordinates. If no subordinates, salary[i] = 1.3. To compute this, process employees in topological order where all subordinates are processed before their managers.Therefore, the graph we need to build is such that for each i, and for each j in subordinates of i (j is a subordinate of i), there is an edge from j to i. Because j must be processed before i. So the graph is made of edges j -&gt; i for each i&#39;s subordinate j. Then, the topological sort of this graph will give the correct order.Wait, but the graph would consist of all edges j → i where i is a direct manager of j. Wait, no. Wait, if i is a direct manager of j, then j is a direct subordinate of i. So in terms of dependencies, i&#39;s salary depends on j&#39;s. So there is an edge from j to i. So for each such pair, we add j → i. Then, the topological sort will process j before i.But wait, if j is a subordinate of i, then i&#39;s salary depends on j&#39;s. So when processing i, we need j&#39;s salary. So j must be processed before i. So the edge is j → i, and the topological order is such that j comes before i.Yes. So building the graph as edges j → i for every i where j is a direct subordinate of i (i is a manager of j). Then the topological order of this graph will allow us to process each employee after all their subordinates have been processed.Once we have the topological order, we can compute the salaries in that order, since for each employee i, all j (subordinates) have already been processed.So the steps are:- For each test case:   - Read n and the relations matrix.   - For each employee i, collect their direct subordinates (j where relations[i][j] is &#39;Y&#39;).   - Build the graph: for each i, for each j in subordinates, add an edge j → i. Because i&#39;s salary depends on j&#39;s.   - Perform a topological sort on this graph.   - Initialize a salary array. For each employee in the topological order, compute their salary: sum of salaries of their direct subordinates. If no subordinates, salary is 1.   - Sum all the salaries and output.But wait, the graph might have cycles? But according to the problem statement, if A is a boss of B, B cannot be a boss of A. So the hierarchy is a DAG. So the graph is acyclic, and topological sort is possible.So the main steps are:1. For each employee, find their direct subordinates (those j where i is their direct manager, i.e., relations[i][j] == &#39;Y&#39;).2. Build the dependency graph where for each j in i&#39;s subordinates, add an edge j → i.3. Perform a topological sort on this graph.4. Process the employees in the topological order, calculating their salary as the sum of their subordinates&#39; salaries (if any) or 1.Now, how to implement this in Python.First, reading the input. For each test case:The input starts with T, then T test cases. Each test case has n followed by n lines of n characters each.So for each test case, read n, then read n strings.Then, for each i (employee), collect all j where relations[i][j] is &#39;Y&#39;. So for each i in 0..n-1, subordinates[i] = [j for j in 0..n-1 if relations[i][j] == &#39;Y&#39;]Then, build the graph: for each i, for each j in subordinates[i], add an edge from j to i.Once the graph is built, perform a topological sort.The topological sort can be done using Kahn&#39;s algorithm (indegree-based approach), or via DFS.Kahn&#39;s algorithm is probably easier here.Let&#39;s think about building the adjacency list. The graph is represented as a list of outgoing edges. For each node, list all nodes it points to. Then, for Kahn&#39;s algorithm:Initialize in-degree for each node as 0.For each edge j → i:   add i to the adjacency list of j.   increment in_degree[i] by 1.Then, collect all nodes with in_degree 0 into a queue.Process each node in the queue: for each neighbor in adjacency list, decrement their in_degree, and add to queue if in_degree becomes 0.The order in which nodes are processed is the topological order.But wait, in this case, the graph is constructed as edges j → i for each j in subordinates of i. So for each j in subordinates[i], j is a subordinate of i, so i is a manager of j, which means j&#39;s salary is part of i&#39;s salary. Therefore, when processing i, j must have been processed already.But according to the graph edges, j → i, so the topological order will have j before i. So when processing in the order of the topological sort, i will come after j.Wait, no. Kahn&#39;s algorithm processes nodes with in_degree 0 first. For example, if the graph is j → i, then j has in_degree 0, and i has in_degree 1. So j is processed first. Then, after j is processed, i&#39;s in_degree becomes 0, so i is processed next. So the topological order is j, then i.Which is correct, as j is a subordinate of i, so j&#39;s salary is needed before i&#39;s.So when processing the topological order, we process j first, then i. So when computing salary[i], j&#39;s salary is already known.Yes. So processing in the topological order given by Kahn&#39;s algorithm will allow us to compute the salaries correctly.Once we have the topological order, we can iterate through each node in the order, compute their salary as the sum of their direct subordinates&#39; salaries, or 1 if none.Wait, but the direct subordinates for i are j&#39;s where relations[i][j] is &#39;Y&#39;. So for each i, the list of subordinates is already known. So during processing, for each i in the topological order, the salary[i] is sum of salaries[j] for j in subordinates[i], or 1 if subordinates[i] is empty.Yes.So the steps in code:For each test case:   read n.   read n lines, each line is a string of length n.   build subordinates[i] for each i.   build the graph edges j → i for each j in subordinates[i].   perform topological sort to get the order.   compute salaries in that order.   sum all salaries.So the code outline.But wait, how to handle the edges. For example, for each i, for each j in subordinates[i], add an edge from j to i.So the adjacency list would be a list where adj[j] contains i.Because j is a subordinate of i, so j must be processed before i.So the code:subordinates = [[] for _ in range(n)]for i in range(n):    for j in range(n):        if relations[i][j] == &#39;Y&#39;:            subordinates[i].append(j)Then, build the graph edges:adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]in_degree = [0] * nfor i in range(n):    for j in subordinates[i]:        adj[j].append(i)  # edge j → i        in_degree[i] += 1Then, perform Kahn&#39;s algorithm:queue = deque()for node in range(n):    if in_degree[node] == 0:        queue.append(node)order = []while queue:    u = queue.popleft()    order.append(u)    for v in adj[u]:        in_degree[v] -= 1        if in_degree[v] == 0:            queue.append(v)But since the graph is a DAG, this will process all nodes.Once we have the order, compute salaries:salary = [0] * nfor u in order:    if len(subordinates[u]) == 0:        salary[u] = 1    else:        total = 0        for j in subordinates[u]:            total += salary[j]        salary[u] = totalThen, sum all salaries.So, putting it all together.Let&#39;s test with the sample input.Sample Input:14NNYNNNYNNNNNNYYNSo for n=4.Test case:The relations are 4 strings:Employee 0: &#39;NNYN&#39; → j=0: N, j=1: N, j=2: Y, j=3: N. So subordinates[0] = [2].Employee 1: &#39;NNYN&#39; → subordinates[1] = [2].Employee 2: &#39;NNNN&#39; → no subordinates. So salary is 1.Employee 3: &#39;NYYN&#39; → j=0: N, j=1: Y, j=2: Y, j=3: N. So subordinates[3] = [1, 2].So the graph edges are:For i=0, subordinates are [2] → edge 2 → 0.For i=1, subordinates are [2] → edge 2 → 1.For i=2, no subordinates → no edges.For i=3, subordinates are [1,2] → edges 1 →3 and 2→3.So the adj list:adj[2] = [0,1,3]adj[1] = [3]adj[0] = []adj[3] = []In_degree:node 0: edges coming from 2 → in_degree is 1 (from i=0&#39;s edge 2→0).node 1: edges from 2 → in_degree is 1 (from i=1&#39;s edge 2→1).node 2: no edges → in_degree 0.node 3: edges from 1 and 2 → in_degree is 2 (from i=3&#39;s edges 1→3 and 2→3).So initial queue has node 2.Process node 2. Add to order. Then process its adj nodes (0,1,3).For each of them:0&#39;s in_degree was 1. Decrement to 0 → add to queue.1&#39;s in_degree was 1. Decrement to 0 → add to queue.3&#39;s in_degree was 2. Decrement to 1.So order is [2].Next, queue has 0 and 1.Process 0: add to order. Adj nodes are none. So nothing changes.Then process 1: add to order. Its adj nodes are [3]. For each v=3, in_degree was 1 (after previous step), now 0. Add to queue.Order now is [2,0,1].Then process 3: add to order. Its adj nodes are none.Final order: [2,0,1,3].Now compute salaries:Process each in order.2: has no subordinates → salary 1.0: subordinates are [2] → salary is 1.1: subordinates are [2] → salary 1.3: subordinates are [1,2]. Their salaries are 1 and 1 → sum 2. So salary[3] = 2.Sum all salaries: 1 +1 +1 +2 =5. Which matches the sample output.So the code works for the sample.Now, handling multiple test cases. Also, the code must read from stdin, process T test cases, and output the sum for each.So the Python code would look like this:Import necessary modules (like sys and deque).Read T.For each T:   Read n.   Read n lines, each line is a string.   Build the subordinates list.   Build the adjacency list and in_degree.   Perform Kahn&#39;s algorithm to get topological order.   Compute salaries in that order.   Sum and print the total.So the code:import sysfrom collections import dequedef main():    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())    for _ in range(T):        n = int(sys.stdin.readline())        relations = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]        # Build subordinates        subordinates = [[] for _ in range(n)]        for i in range(n):            for j in range(n):                if relations[i][j] == &#39;Y&#39;:                    subordinates[i].append(j)        # Build adjacency list and in_degree        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]        in_degree = [0] * n        for i in range(n):            for j in subordinates[i]:                adj[j].append(i)                in_degree[i] += 1        # Kahn&#39;s algorithm        queue = deque()        for node in range(n):            if in_degree[node] == 0:                queue.append(node)        order = []        while queue:            u = queue.popleft()            order.append(u)            for v in adj[u]:                in_degree[v] -= 1                if in_degree[v] == 0:                    queue.append(v)        # Compute salaries        salary = [0] * n        total = 0        for u in order:            if not subordinates[u]:                salary[u] = 1            else:                salary[u] = sum(salary[j] for j in subordinates[u])            total += salary[u]        print(total)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()Wait, but in the code, the order is processed in the topological order. Then, for each u in order:salary[u] is calculated as sum of salaries of j in subordinates[u], which are processed before u. Because in the topological order, all j in subordinates[u] are processed before u. Because for each j in subordinates[u], there&#39;s an edge j → u, so j comes before u in the topological order.Yes. So this code should work.Testing the sample input:Sample Input:14NNYNNNYNNNNNNYYNThe code will process order [2,0,1,3], salaries are 1, 1, 1, 2. Sum is 5. Correct.Another test case: n=1. Then the employee has no subordinates (since the string is &#39;N&#39;). Salary is 1. Sum is 1.Another test case: n=2. If employee 0 has subordinate 1, and employee 1 has no subordinates. Then the order is 1,0. Salary of 1 is 1, salary of 0 is 1. Sum is 2.Another case: employee 0 has subordinate 1, employee 1 has subordinate 0. But according to the problem statement, this is impossible. Because A is boss of B and B is boss of A. So the code would not handle that. But according to the problem statement, the input will have valid relations where the hierarchy is a DAG.So the code is correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of salaries for all employees in a corporation based on their hierarchical relationships. The salary calculation follows specific rules where employees without subordinates earn a salary of 1, and employees with subordinates earn a salary equal to the sum of their direct subordinates&#39; salaries.  Approach1. Input Parsing: Read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the matrix representing employee relationships.2. Subordinate Identification: For each employee, identify their direct subordinates based on the input matrix.3. Graph Construction: Construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where edges point from subordinates to their managers. This helps in topological sorting.4. Topological Sorting: Use Kahn&#39;s algorithm to perform a topological sort on the graph to ensure we process employees in an order where all subordinates are processed before their managers.5. Salary Calculation: Using the topological order, compute salaries starting from employees with no subordinates (leaf nodes) up to the highest managers. Each employee&#39;s salary is the sum of their direct subordinates&#39; salaries or 1 if they have no subordinates.6. Summing Salaries: Sum up all the salaries calculated for each test case and print the result. Solution Code```pythonimport sysfrom collections import dequedef main():    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())    for _ in range(T):        n = int(sys.stdin.readline())        relations = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]        subordinates = [[] for _ in range(n)]        for i in range(n):            for j in range(n):                if relations[i][j] == &#39;Y&#39;:                    subordinates[i].append(j)        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]        in_degree = [0] * n        for i in range(n):            for j in subordinates[i]:                adj[j].append(i)                in_degree[i] += 1        queue = deque()        for node in range(n):            if in_degree[node] == 0:                queue.append(node)        order = []        while queue:            u = queue.popleft()            order.append(u)            for v in adj[u]:                in_degree[v] -= 1                if in_degree[v] == 0:                    queue.append(v)        total = 0        salary = [0] * n        for u in order:            if not subordinates[u]:                salary[u] = 1            else:                salary[u] = sum(salary[j] for j in subordinates[u])            total += salary[u]        print(total)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation1. Input Parsing: The input is read using standard input functions. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` strings representing the direct manager relationships.2. Subordinate Identification: For each employee, we determine their direct subordinates by checking where the matrix entries are &#39;Y&#39;.3. Graph Construction: We build a graph where edges point from each subordinate to their manager. This helps in determining the correct processing order using topological sorting.4. Topological Sorting: Using Kahn&#39;s algorithm, we process nodes starting from those with no incoming edges (subordinates) to ensure all dependencies are resolved before processing a manager.5. Salary Calculation: Following the topological order, each employee&#39;s salary is computed based on their subordinates&#39; salaries. If an employee has no subordinates, their salary is set to 1.6. Summing Salaries: The total salary for each test case is accumulated and printed, ensuring the solution is efficient and handles up to the maximum constraints effectively.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ef989c89 data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review" data-v-299cbbd1><div class="review-title" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>❓:</span>Oh no! Joanna just spilled some syrup on her keyboard and now some of the keys are sticky. This causes her considerable frustration, as every time she presses one of the sticky keys, the corresponding character gets entered twice on her computer. This could not have happened at a more inconvenient time; it is the start of the contest and she was just about to type in the solution to the first problem! Joanna does not have time to remove and clean every key on her keyboard, so she wonders if there is a way to quickly identify the sticky keys. Starting to panic, she quickly types some text on her keyboard and stares at the resulting text displayed on her screen.Given the line of text that Joanna typed on her keyboard and the resulting text displayed on her screen, help her determine which keys must be sticky.-----Input-----The input consists of: - One line containing a string s (1 leq mathrm{length}(s) leq 1000), the text that Joanna typed on her keyboard. - One line containing a string t (1 leq mathrm{length}(t) leq 1000), the text displayed on Joanna’s screen as a result.Both s and t consist only of lower-case letters (‘a’–‘z’) and spaces (‘ ’), and start and end with a letter.It is guaranteed that t is the result of doubling each character in s that corresponds to a sticky key. At least one character in s corresponds to a sticky key (i.e. s neq t).-----Output-----Output all characters (letters and space) corresponding to keys that must be sticky, in any order.-----Examples-----Sample Input:this is very annoyingthiss iss veery annoyingSample Output:se</div><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🧠:</span>Okay, I need to solve this problem where Joanna has some sticky keys that cause characters to be typed twice. The task is to find out which keys are sticky based on the original string she typed (s) and the resulting string on the screen (t). Let me start by understanding the problem. So, the idea is that when Joanna presses a sticky key, it outputs the character twice. So, for example, if &#39;s&#39; is sticky, then in s, whenever she types &#39;s&#39; once, it appears as &#39;ss&#39; in t. But for non-sticky keys, each press in s corresponds to exactly one character in t. So, given s and t, I need to find all characters in s that were duplicated in t. The output is the set of characters that must be sticky. The approach here would be to compare s and t, character by character, and see which characters in s are followed by the same character in t. Because each sticky key in s would produce two identical characters in t, while non-sticky ones produce one. Wait, let me think. Let&#39;s take the sample input:s is &quot;this is very annoying&quot;t is &quot;thiss iss veery annoying&quot;Looking at the first part:s starts with &#39;t&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;s&#39;...t starts with &#39;t&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;s&#39;... So in s, the &#39;s&#39; was typed once, but in t it&#39;s doubled. So &#39;s&#39; is a sticky key.Similarly, in the next part of s, there&#39;s an &#39;i&#39; followed by &#39;s&#39; (so &quot;is&quot;), but in t, it&#39;s &#39;i&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;s&#39;... Wait no. The s in &quot;is&quot; would be sticky, leading to two &#39;s&#39;s. So the output includes &#39;s&#39; and &#39;e&#39; as per the sample.So the process is to check for each character in s whether the corresponding characters in t are duplicated. But how exactly?Let&#39;s think about the way s and t are related. Each character in s can either be sticky or not. If it&#39;s sticky, in t, that character appears twice. If not, it appears once. So the total length of t is equal to the sum of the lengths of each character&#39;s contribution. For example, if a character in s is sticky, it contributes 2 to t&#39;s length. Otherwise, 1. Since the total length of t is the sum over each character in s of (1 if not sticky, 2 if sticky). But how to model this? Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s process s and t by comparing them step by step. We can iterate through both strings, keeping track of the positions in s and t. For each character in s, check if the current position in t matches once or twice. Let me outline the steps:1. Initialize two pointers, i for s and j for t, both starting at 0.2. For each character c in s (starting from i=0):   a. Check if the next character in t is the same as c. If so, then this could be a sticky key. But we need to make sure that in t, there are two consecutive c&#39;s.    b. If t[j] is c and t[j+1] is also c, then c is sticky. Add to a set of sticky keys. Then, move j by 2.   c. If t[j] is c but the next character is not c (or there&#39;s no next character), then c is not sticky. Move j by 1.3. However, there&#39;s a problem here: what if there&#39;s a scenario where a non-sticky character in s leads to a single c in t, but the next character in s is the same as c. For example, suppose s is &#39;aa&#39;, and t is &#39;a a a a&#39;. Wait, no. If both &#39;a&#39;s are sticky, then t would be &#39;aaaa&#39;. If only the first &#39;a&#39; is sticky, then t would be &#39;a a a&#39; (but the first &#39;a&#39; is doubled, then the second is single). But in that case, the t would be &#39;aaa&#39; (since first a in s becomes &#39;aa&#39;, second a becomes &#39;a&#39;, total length 3). But the problem states that t is the result of some combination of sticky keys. So the given t must be possible based on s and some set of sticky keys. So the input is always valid. So the approach is: for each character in s, check how it is represented in t. If the next two characters in t are the same as the current character in s, then it&#39;s a sticky key. Otherwise, it&#39;s not. But how to handle the pointers correctly. Let&#39;s think in code:We have i for s, j for t.For each i from 0 to len(s)-1:   current_char = s[i]   if j+1 &lt; len(t):       if t[j] == current_char and t[j+1] == current_char:           add current_char to sticky set           j += 2       else if t[j] == current_char:           j +=1       else:           # invalid case, but according to problem statement, input is valid.   else:       # j is at the last character of t. So current_char must be t[j], and it&#39;s not sticky.       j +=1So this way, for each character in s, we check if in t, there are two of them. If so, then the key is sticky.But this approach would correctly parse t by checking whether each character in s is represented by one or two characters in t.So the algorithm is:Initialize i=0, j=0.sticky = set()while i &lt; len(s) and j &lt; len(t):   c = s[i]   if j+1 &lt; len(t) and t[j] == c and t[j+1] == c:       sticky.add(c)       j +=2       i +=1   elif t[j] == c:       j +=1       i +=1   else:       # according to the problem statement, this case can&#39;t happen.So once we process all characters in s, we check if j has reached the end of t. If not, but according to the problem statement, t is a valid result, so this code should process correctly.Once all characters are processed, the sticky set contains all keys that are sticky.Wait, but why? Because whenever a character in s is sticky, t has two copies of that character. So for each character in s, during processing, if the next two in t are same, then the key is considered sticky.But how do we handle cases where a non-sticky key is followed by the same character as the next key. For example:s = &quot;ab&quot;, t = &quot;aab&quot;.In this case, the first &#39;a&#39; in s is not sticky (since in t, the first two are &#39;aa&#39;, which would imply that &#39;a&#39; is sticky. But according to our code, when processing the first &#39;a&#39; in s, we check t[j] and t[j+1]. j starts at 0. t[0] is &#39;a&#39;, t[1] is &#39;a&#39;. So code would add &#39;a&#39; to the sticky set, and j becomes 2, i becomes 1. Then, processing &#39;b&#39; in s. t[2] is &#39;b&#39;. So code checks if j+1 is within t&#39;s length (2+1=3, which is beyond len(t)=3? So j+1 is 3 which is equal to len(t). So else clause: check if t[j] is &#39;b&#39;. It is, so j increments to 3, i increments to 2. Loop ends. So the sticky set is {&#39;a&#39;}, but in reality, the &#39;a&#39; in s is not sticky. Wait, but in this example, how?Wait, if s is &quot;ab&quot; and t is &quot;aab&quot;, then according to the problem statement, this is possible only if the first &#39;a&#39; is sticky. Because sticky keys are the ones that when pressed, output two characters. So in s, the &#39;a&#39; is pressed once, so in t it becomes &#39;aa&#39;, then &#39;b&#39; is non-sticky, so &#39;b&#39; is output once. So the t is &quot;aab&quot;, which matches. So according to our code, the sticky set would have &#39;a&#39;, which is correct. Because in this case, &#39;a&#39; is sticky.But in this scenario, the problem states that t is generated by doubling some of the characters in s. So this case is valid, and the code would correctly identify &#39;a&#39; as sticky.So, the code logic works.Now, what about the sample input:s = &quot;this is very annoying&quot; t = &quot;thiss iss veery annoying&quot;Processing each character:s[0] = &#39;t&#39; → in t, the first two chars are &#39;t&#39; and &#39;h&#39;? Wait, wait let me recheck.Wait, the sample input s is &quot;this is very annoying&quot; → let&#39;s split into characters:s: t h i s   i s   v e r y   a n n o y i n g t: t h i s s   i s s   v e e r y   a n n o y i n g So for each character:For the first &#39;t&#39; in s: in t, it&#39;s &#39;t&#39; followed by &#39;h&#39; → so not duplicated. So &#39;t&#39; is not sticky.Next is &#39;h&#39; in s: in t, after &#39;t&#39; is &#39;h&#39;, which is followed by &#39;i&#39; → &#39;h&#39; is not sticky.Then &#39;i&#39; in s: followed by &#39;s&#39; in t. So not duplicated.Then &#39;s&#39; in s: next in t is &#39;s&#39; followed by another &#39;s&#39; → so &#39;s&#39; is sticky. So add to the set. j moves by 2.Then the next is space in s. Let&#39;s see. The next part in t after the two &#39;s&#39;s is a space (if I look at the sample t: &quot;thiss iss...&quot;, so after the two s&#39;s comes a space. Wait, the sample input for t is &quot;thiss iss veery annoying&quot;. So the first &#39;s&#39; in s is followed by another &#39;s&#39; in t. So that &#39;s&#39; is sticky. Then the next character in s is a space. Let&#39;s see in t: after the two s&#39;s (positions 3 and 4 in t), the next character is a space (position 5). So in s, the space is part of the input. Let&#39;s see how that is processed.So for the space in s (s[4] is space?), wait let me count:Original s: &quot;this is very annoying&quot;Breaking into characters (including spaces):Indices 0: t, 1:h, 2:i, 3:s, 4: space, 5:i, 6:s, 7: space, etc.So in t, after the two s&#39;s (indices 3 and 4 in t), the next character is index 5: space. So in s&#39;s next character is a space. So j is at 5. The code checks if t[j] is the space, and since the next character (j+1) would be 6, which is &#39;i&#39; (assuming the next part is &#39; iss&#39;). So t[j] is space, but the next character is &#39;i&#39;. So the code would process the space in s as non-sticky. So j increments by 1.Then the next character in s is &#39;i&#39; (s[5]). In t, j is now 6. Check if t[6] is &#39;i&#39;, and t[7] is &#39;s&#39;? So no. So code adds &#39;i&#39; to non-sticky. j increments to 7. Then in s, the next character is &#39;s&#39; (s[6]). In t, j is 7. Check t[7] and t[8]. If they are both &#39;s&#39;, then &#39;s&#39; is sticky. But in the sample t, after &#39;i&#39; comes &#39;s&#39;, then another &#39;s&#39;. So j=7, t[7] is &#39;s&#39;, t[8] is &#39;s&#39;. So code adds &#39;s&#39; to the sticky set again. But wait, in the sample output, &#39;s&#39; is included once. But since the set is a data structure, duplicates are ignored. So even if a character is processed multiple times as sticky, the set will only have it once. So the code would collect all the characters in s that were followed by two identical characters in t. Thus, the set will contain all the sticky keys.In the sample, the output is &#39;s&#39; and &#39;e&#39;. Let&#39;s see why. The &#39;e&#39; comes from the &#39;very&#39; part of s. In s, &#39;very&#39; is v e r y. In t, it&#39;s &#39;veery&#39; → so the &#39;e&#39; in s is followed by two &#39;e&#39;s in t. So code would detect that the &#39;e&#39; is sticky. So the code logic works.Now, considering edge cases. For example:Case where a character in s is duplicated and some are sticky. Like s = &#39;aa&#39;, t = &#39;aaaa&#39;. Then both &#39;a&#39;s are sticky. So the output is &#39;a&#39;.Another case: s = &#39;a a&#39; (two a&#39;s separated by space), t is &#39;aaaa&#39; (each a is sticky). Then the output is &#39;a&#39;.Another case: s = &#39;ab&#39;, t = &#39;aabb&#39;. Then both &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39; are sticky. So output is &#39;ab&#39; (order doesn&#39;t matter).So the code correctly handles these cases.Now, the code needs to process s and t. But how to handle spaces? Well, according to the problem statement, both s and t can contain lowercase letters and spaces. So in the code, spaces are treated as characters. So the code should process them as any other character.Now, implementing this in Python.The steps for the code:1. Read two lines from stdin: s and t. (But need to make sure that leading/trailing whitespace is not considered. The problem states that both start and end with a letter, so perhaps the input lines are read with strip()? Or not. Because according to the problem statement, the input lines start and end with a letter. So when reading, perhaps using input().strip() is not necessary. But in practice, sometimes trailing newlines can be present. So perhaps read using:s = input().strip()t = input().strip()But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so maybe not. But in some cases, the input lines may have leading/trailing spaces which are not part of the actual s and t. But the problem says that both start and end with a letter. So using strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, which is not desired. For example, if the actual s starts with a space, but according to the problem statement, that&#39;s impossible. So the code can safely read using input().strip()?Wait, the problem says that both s and t start and end with a letter. So the first and last characters are letters. So, when reading from stdin, perhaps there are no leading or trailing spaces. Therefore, using s = input().strip() may be incorrect, because if the input line for s is (for example) &#39;abc &#39; (with a trailing space), then stripping would remove that space, but according to the problem statement, that&#39;s not possible. Therefore, the code should read the lines as is, except for the trailing newline. So:s = input().rstrip(&#39;n&#39;)t = input().rstrip(&#39;n&#39;)But in Python, input() automatically reads until the newline and strips the trailing newline. So s = input() will give the correct s, including leading and trailing characters as per the input. So for example, if the first line is &#39;abc&#39;, then input() gives &#39;abc&#39;. If the first line is &#39;abc &#39;, then input() gives &#39;abc &#39; (with a space at the end), but according to the problem statement, this is invalid. But the problem states that the input is guaranteed to meet the constraints, so we don&#39;t need to handle that. So in code, just read s and t as:s = input().strip()t = input().strip()Wait no. Wait, the problem says that s and t start and end with a letter. So, leading and trailing whitespaces are not present. So using strip() would be safe. Because even if the user inputs leading or trailing spaces (which are not allowed), the problem says that the input is correct. So, perhaps the actual inputs will not have leading/trailing spaces, so the code can safely read the lines using input().strip(). But in cases where the input has leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says they can&#39;t, so the code can assume that input().strip() is correct. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines, each being the string. So, for example, in the sample input, the first line is &#39;this is very annoying&#39;, which starts with &#39;t&#39; and ends with &#39;g&#39;, no leading or trailing spaces. So using input().strip() would not affect it. But if there&#39;s a line like &#39;  abc  &#39;, then strip() would turn it into &#39;abc&#39;, which is not allowed. But according to the problem, such cases are not present. So, perhaps, to read the input correctly, the code should read the entire line, including leading and trailing spaces. However, in Python, the input() function includes the trailing newline? No. The input() function reads until the newline and returns the string without the trailing newline. So, for example, if the input line is &#39;abc &#39;, then input() will return &#39;abc &#39; (with the trailing space). So in code, the correct way is to read the lines as:s = input().rstrip(&#39;n&#39;)t = input().rstrip(&#39;n&#39;)But perhaps it&#39;s easier to just use:s = input()t = input()Because in the problem statement, the input is given correctly, so leading and trailing spaces are not present, except for the actual spaces in the middle. So in code, reading using input() is correct.But in some cases, when the user enters the input, they might have leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so such cases are not possible. Therefore, the code can safely read s and t as:s = input().strip()t = input().strip()But wait, this would remove any leading or trailing spaces, which are not allowed. For example, the problem states that s and t start and end with a letter. So, if the input is, for example, &#39;a b c&#39; (which starts with &#39;a&#39; and ends with &#39;c&#39;), then input().strip() is okay. But if the input line is &#39; a b c&#39;, then input().strip() would turn it into &#39;a b c&#39;, but according to the problem statement, such input is invalid, and thus not possible. So the code can safely read using:s = input()t = input()But in Python, input() returns the line read from input, without the trailing newline. So leading and trailing spaces are preserved. So for example, if the first line is &#39;this is very annoying&#39; (with no leading or trailing spaces), then s is &#39;this is very annoying&#39;. So the code will process correctly.So, proceeding with reading s and t as input(). Now, the code:Implement the pointer approach. Initialize i=0, j=0. sticky is a set. Iterate through s and t:sticky = set()i = j = 0len_s = len(s)len_t = len(t)while i &lt; len_s and j &lt; len_t:    c = s[i]    if j +1 &lt; len_t and t[j] == c and t[j+1] == c:        sticky.add(c)        j +=2        i +=1    elif t[j] == c:        j +=1        i +=1    else:        # impossible case, but per problem statement, input is valid.        passOnce the loop is done, output the characters in the sticky set.But what if the loop ends but j hasn&#39;t reached the end of t? According to the problem statement, the input is valid, so this should not happen. So the code can proceed.So, collect all characters in the sticky set and output them as a string in any order.So, the code would:Read s and t.Process as per the code above.Then, output the characters in the sticky set as a string.But in Python, the order is not preserved in a set, but the problem allows any order.So, in code:s = input().strip()t = input().strip()i = j = 0sticky = set()n = len(s)m = len(t)while i &lt; n and j &lt; m:    current_s = s[i]    # Check if the current and next in t are same as current_s    if j + 1 &lt; m and t[j] == current_s and t[j+1] == current_s:        sticky.add(current_s)        j += 2        i += 1    elif t[j] == current_s:        j += 1        i += 1    else:        # According to the problem statement, this won&#39;t happen.        # So, perhaps in some cases, but the problem says input is valid.        # So, we can proceed.        pass# After processing, the sticky set has the required characters.# Convert to a string and print.print(&#39;&#39;.join(sticky))Testing this code with the sample input:Sample Input:this is very annoyingthiss iss veery annoyingProcessing:i=0, j=0. current_s = &#39;t&#39;, t[j] is &#39;t&#39;, j+1 is 1, t[1] is &#39;h&#39;. So not same. So code proceeds to else if. t[j] == &#39;t&#39; → yes. So j increments to 1, i increments to 1.i=1, current_s=&#39;h&#39;. t[j=1] is &#39;h&#39;. j+1=2: t[2] is &#39;i&#39; → no. So j increments to 2, i to 2.current_s=&#39;i&#39;, t[2] is &#39;i&#39;. j+1=3: t[3] is &#39;s&#39; → no. So j becomes 3, i=3.current_s=&#39;s&#39;, t[3] is &#39;s&#39;. j+1=4 &lt; m. t[4] is &#39;s&#39; → yes. So add &#39;s&#39; to sticky. j becomes 5, i=4.current_s is the space. t[5] is &#39; &#39; (assuming that in the sample input t is &quot;thiss iss...&quot; → after the two s&#39;s, there&#39;s a space. So j=5. Check t[j] and j+1. j+1 is 6, which is &#39;i&#39; (since next part is &quot;iss&quot;). So t[j] is &#39; &#39;, and t[j+1] is &#39;i&#39; → not same. So code increments j to 6, i to 5.current_s is &#39;i&#39; (s[5] is &#39;i&#39;). t[6] is &#39;i&#39;. j+1=7: t[7] is &#39;s&#39;. So not same. So j becomes 7, i becomes 6.current_s is &#39;s&#39; (s[6] is &#39;s&#39;). t[j=7] is &#39;s&#39;, j+1=8. t[8] is &#39;s&#39;. So add &#39;s&#39; to sticky (already in set). j becomes 9, i=7.current_s is space (s[7] is space). j=9: t[9] is &#39;v&#39;? Wait, perhaps in the sample t, after &#39;iss&#39; comes &#39; veery&#39;.Wait, the sample t is &quot;thiss iss veery annoying&quot;. So after the &#39;iss&#39; (which is the part where s is &#39;is&#39; becomes &#39;iss&#39;), then comes a space. Let me re-examine the t string.Sample t:t is &quot;thiss iss veery annoying&quot;Breaking into characters:t: t h i s s  i s s  v e e r y  a n n o y i n g So the first part is &quot;thiss&quot; → t h i s s.Then a space (index 5?), then &quot;iss&quot; → i s s (indexes 6,7,8). Then space (index9), then &quot;veery&quot; → v e e r y.So when processing the space in s[4], the code would process t[j=5], which is a space. Then j increments to 6. Then i=5, current_s is &#39;i&#39; (s[5] is &#39;i&#39;). t[j=6] is &#39;i&#39;, j+1=7 is &#39;s&#39; → no. So j increments to 7. current_s is &#39;i&#39; (s[5] is &#39;i&#39;) → wait, perhaps my previous analysis is wrong.Alternatively, maybe the code steps through the sample input correctly. For the &#39;veery&#39; part in t, which comes after the &#39;iss&#39; part.So in the &#39;very&#39; part of s (s is &#39;very&#39; → &#39;v&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;y&#39;), in t it&#39;s &#39;veery&#39;. So for the &#39;e&#39; in s, which is the second character in &#39;very&#39;, the code would check in t. So for that &#39;e&#39; in s (i points to it), j is at a certain position. Let&#39;s see:After processing the &#39;v&#39; in s&#39;s &#39;very&#39; part, j would be at the position after the space. Let&#39;s say after processing the &#39;v&#39; in s, j is at position where t[j] is &#39;v&#39;, then check if next is also &#39;v&#39;. If not, then &#39;v&#39; is not sticky. Then, j increments by 1. Then, current_s is &#39;e&#39; (s&#39;s next character). In t, j is now at &#39;e&#39; (t[j] = &#39;e&#39;). Check if j+1 is &#39;e&#39;. Yes. So add &#39;e&#39; to sticky. j increases by 2, i increases by 1. So the &#39;e&#39; is added.Thus, the code correctly captures &#39;s&#39; and &#39;e&#39; as the sticky keys.So the code seems to handle the sample correctly.Now, let&#39;s think about another test case. For example:s = &quot;a&quot;, t = &quot;aa&quot;. Then, the code would detect that the current_s &#39;a&#39; is followed by two &#39;a&#39;s. So &#39;a&#39; is added to the sticky set. Output is &#39;a&#39;.Another test case: s = &quot;ab&quot;, t = &quot;aab&quot;. Then s is &#39;a&#39; followed by &#39;b&#39;. t is &#39;aab&#39;. Processing:i=0, j=0. current_s is &#39;a&#39;. t[j] is &#39;a&#39;, t[j+1] is &#39;a&#39;. So add &#39;a&#39; to sticky. j becomes 2, i becomes 1. current_s is &#39;b&#39;. t[2] is &#39;b&#39;. j+1 is 3, which is beyond len(t)=3. So code checks if t[j] is &#39;b&#39; → yes. j becomes 3, i becomes 2. loop ends. So sticky set is {&#39;a&#39;}, so output is &#39;a&#39;.Which is correct, because the &#39;a&#39; is sticky. So &#39;a&#39; is pressed once, output as &#39;aa&#39;; &#39;b&#39; is pressed once, output as &#39;b&#39;. So t is &#39;aab&#39;.Another test case: s = &quot;a e&quot;, t = &quot;aa  ee&quot;. So s is &#39;a&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;e&#39;. t is &#39;aa&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;ee&#39;. Let&#39;s see:Processing:i=0, j=0: current_s is &#39;a&#39;. j=0, t[0] is &#39;a&#39;, t[1] is &#39;a&#39; → add &#39;a&#39; to sticky. j becomes 2, i becomes 1.i=1: current_s is &#39; &#39;. j=2: t[2] is &#39; &#39;, j+1=3: t[3] is &#39; &#39; → add &#39; &#39; to sticky. j becomes 4, i becomes 2.i=2: current_s is &#39;e&#39;. j=4: t[4] is &#39;e&#39;, j+1=5 is &#39;e&#39; → add &#39;e&#39; to sticky. j becomes 6, i=3. Loop ends. So sticky set is {&#39;a&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;e&#39;}, output is any order, like &#39;a e&#39;.But according to the problem statement, the output is the characters (including space) that are sticky. So this is correct.Thus, the code handles spaces correctly.So the code seems correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to identify which keys on Joanna&#39;s keyboard are sticky based on the text she typed and the resulting text displayed on her screen. Sticky keys cause characters to be entered twice when pressed once. Approach1. Problem Analysis: The key insight is that each character in the input string `s` will either appear once or twice in the output string `t`. If a character appears twice in `t` for each occurrence in `s`, that character corresponds to a sticky key.2. Algorithm:   - Use two pointers to traverse both strings `s` and `t` simultaneously.   - For each character in `s`, check if the corresponding characters in `t` are duplicated. If they are, mark the character as sticky.   - Move the pointers forward by 2 positions if the character is sticky, otherwise move by 1 position.3. Complexity: The algorithm runs in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the longer string between `s` and `t`. This is efficient given the constraints (up to 1000 characters). Solution Code```pythons = input().strip()t = input().strip()i = j = 0sticky = set()n, m = len(s), len(t)while i &lt; n and j &lt; m:    current = s[i]    if j + 1 &lt; m and t[j] == current and t[j+1] == current:        sticky.add(current)        j += 2        i += 1    elif t[j] == current:        j += 1        i += 1print(&#39;&#39;.join(sticky))``` Explanation- Reading Input: The input strings `s` and `t` are read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.- Two Pointers: We use two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `s` and `t` respectively.- Check for Sticky Keys: For each character in `s`, we check if the next two characters in `t` are the same. If they are, the character is added to the set of sticky keys, and both pointers are advanced by 2. If not, only the pointer for `t` is advanced by 1.- Output: The sticky keys are collected in a set to avoid duplicates and printed as a concatenated string.This approach efficiently determines which keys are sticky by leveraging a linear scan of both input strings, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.</p><div class="divider" data-v-299cbbd1></div><p class="review-content" data-v-299cbbd1><span class="icon" data-v-299cbbd1>🔑:</span></p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-ef989c89><span data-v-ef989c89>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
