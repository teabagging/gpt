So the task is to determine if we can divide the given sanskars (each with a certain intensity) into K groups such that each group&#39;s sum is equal. First, let&#39;s think about the necessary conditions for this to be possible. The sum of all the intensities must be divisible by K. If the total sum isn&#39;t divisible by K, then it&#39;s automatically impossible. So that&#39;s the first check we need to do. For example, in the sample input, the first case sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18. Divided by 3 gives 6, which is possible. The second case sum is 1+2+4+5+7=19, which divided by 3 gives a remainder, hence the &#39;no&#39; answer.But even if the total sum is divisible by K, it&#39;s not sufficient. We need to ensure that the numbers can actually be partitioned into K subsets each with the target sum. Also, we need to consider that K can&#39;t be larger than N. Wait, wait. The problem says K is the number of followers. So if K is zero? But according to constraints, K is at least 1. So in cases where K is larger than N, like when N=3 and K=4, it&#39;s impossible because each follower needs at least one sanskar. So that&#39;s another check: if K &gt; N, then output &#39;no&#39;.Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem allows K to be up to 8. So first, we need to check if K is zero. Wait, according to the constraints, K is at least 1. So no, but in code, perhaps we need to handle K=0? Well, according to the problem statement&#39;s input constraints, K is between 1 and 8. So perhaps we can skip that check.So the steps are:1. Check if K is 0. If K is zero, perhaps return &#39;no&#39;? But according to the problem constraints, K is &gt;=1. So perhaps not necessary.2. Check if the sum of all intensities is divisible by K. If not, return &#39;no&#39;.3. Calculate the target sum per follower, which is total_sum / K.4. Now, check if any of the individual intensities is greater than the target. Because if a single intensity is larger than target, then it&#39;s impossible. For example, if target is 5 and there&#39;s a 6 in the list. Then that 6 can&#39;t be in any group. So this is another necessary condition.So these are some preliminary checks. Once those are done, we need to check if we can actually partition the array into K subsets each with sum equal to target.But how do we do that efficiently? Since N is up to 21, and K up to 8, a backtracking approach could be feasible. Because 21 elements with 8 subsets, but it&#39;s manageable with some optimizations.Alternatively, this problem is similar to the &quot;Partition to K Equal Subset Sum&quot; problem, which is a well-known backtracking problem. Let&#39;s think about the standard solution for that.The standard approach for that problem is:- Sort the array in descending order to allow early pruning (if a number is too big, we can backtrack early).- Then, try to assign each number to a subset, ensuring that the sum doesn&#39;t exceed the target. We can use a backtracking approach with memoization or pruning.But for N=21 and K=8, the worst case is 21!/(repetitions), which is way too big. So we need optimizations.The key optimizations in the standard approach are:1. Sort the array in reverse order so that larger elements are considered first. This allows us to quickly find cases where a number is too big for the target sum, thus pruning the search early.2. Skip over duplicate elements when backtracking. If the current element is the same as the previous one and the previous one wasn&#39;t used, then skip to avoid redundant work.3. Once a subset is filled (sum reaches target), move to the next subset.But for N=21 and K=8, even with these optimizations, the time might be manageable for small test cases. Since T is up to 10, and N is 21, but K is up to 8. Let&#39;s think. For example, for each element, we try placing it into one of K subsets. But with some subsets already filled. But for 21 elements, even with 8 choices each, 8^21 is way too big. So that&#39;s not feasible. So a backtracking approach that tries all possibilities is not going to work here. So we need a smarter approach.Alternatively, perhaps a memoization-based approach with some state. But even then, the state space might be too large.Wait, but considering that each subset&#39;s sum is fixed (target), perhaps we can model this as a problem of selecting K subsets where each subset&#39;s sum is target, and all elements are used.So the standard backtracking approach for K subsets is to track for each subset how much sum it has so far, and assign elements to subsets in a way that doesn&#39;t exceed the target. The key is to try to place each element into a subset, and backtrack if it&#39;s not possible.But even with that, for 21 elements and 8 subsets, the time could be high. But perhaps with the optimizations mentioned, it&#39;s manageable for small N and K.So let&#39;s outline the steps:First, perform the preliminary checks:- If sum is not divisible by K: return no.- If any element is greater than the target sum: return no.- If K is 0 (but according to constraints, K &gt;=1, so this is unnecessary).- If K &gt; N: since each follower must get at least one sanskar, if K &gt; N, then it&#39;s impossible. For example, if N=3 and K=4, each of the 4 followers needs at least one, but there are only 3 elements. So this case is impossible. So this is another check. So in code, if K &gt; N: output &#39;no&#39;.So these are the initial checks.Once all these are passed, proceed to the backtracking approach.But how to implement the backtracking.Let me think about the standard code for the K equal subset problem.The code could be something like:Sort the array in reverse order.Check if the sum is divisible by K.Check if any element is larger than target.Then, create an array of K elements, each representing the current sum of each subset.Then, recursively try to assign each element to a subset. For each element, try adding it to a subset if the sum doesn&#39;t exceed target. Also, to avoid permutations (like subset order), we can skip subsets that are empty. So for example, when placing the first element, we only place it into the first subset. Then for subsequent elements, if a subset is empty, we can skip trying to place into other empty subsets to avoid redundant work.So for example, when assigning elements, we can track which subsets have the same current sum. If we have multiple subsets with the same sum, and adding the element to any of them leads to the same state, then we can just try one and skip the others.This is the key optimization that reduces the branching factor.Let&#39;s outline this approach in code.Sort the array in reverse order.sum_total = sum(array)if sum_total % K != 0: return Falsetarget = sum_total // Kif any element &gt; target: return Falseif K ==0 or K &gt; len(array): return FalseThen, create a list called subsets, of size K, initialized to 0.Then, start from the first element, and try to place it into each subset.But with some optimizations.The code would look something like this (pseudo-code):def can_partition(array, k):    sum_total = sum(array)    if sum_total % k !=0:        return False    target = sum_total // k    array.sort(reverse=True)    if array[0] &gt; target:        return False    # Now, backtracking    subsets = [0] * k    def backtrack(index):        if index == len(array):            return True        for i in range(k):            if subsets[i] + array[index] &lt;= target:                if i &gt; 0 and subsets[i] == subsets[i-1]:                    continue  # skip duplicates                subsets[i] += array[index]                if backtrack(index+1):                    return True                subsets[i] -= array[index]        return False    return backtrack(0)Wait, but this is a simplified version. But this code has some issues. For example, the &#39;if i&gt;0 and subsets[i] == subsets[i-1]&#39; line. This is to avoid checking the same subset state multiple times. Because if two subsets have the same current sum, and the element is added to either, it&#39;s the same for the backtracking step. So this skips trying to add the same element to multiple subsets that have the same current sum.But the order in which subsets are considered matters. So for example, if we have two subsets with the same sum, adding the current element to subset i and subset j (i&lt;j) where subsets[i] == subsets[j], we can just add to the first one and skip the rest. This reduces the number of branches.This is a crucial optimization for the backtracking approach.So, with this code, sorted in reverse order and with the duplicates skipped, the code can handle the problem efficiently for small N and K.In our case, N is up to 21, K up to 8. Let&#39;s see. For each element, the number of possibilities is K (but reduced by the optimization). But with 21 elements, even with K=8, 8^21 is way too big. So the optimizations are necessary to reduce the branching.In practice, this code may work for the given constraints because the early pruning (like checking if a subset plus current element exceeds target) and the optimization of skipping subsets with same sum as previous can significantly reduce the number of recursive steps.So, the plan is:- For each test case:   - Read N, K.   - Read the list of intensities.   - Check the preliminary conditions:      1. If K &gt; N: output &#39;no&#39;.      2. Compute sum. If sum % K != 0: output &#39;no&#39;.      3. Compute target = sum / K.      4. If any intensity &gt; target: output &#39;no&#39;.   - If all checks passed, proceed to check if the list can be partitioned into K subsets with sum target.Now, how to implement this in Python.But the problem is that N can be up to 21, and K up to 8. So the backtracking approach needs to be optimized.Another point is that the sample input has the first case:Test case 1:5 31 2 4 5 6 → sum 18 → target 6.The code after sorting becomes [6,5,4,2,1].Then the backtracking starts. Let&#39;s see:We need to assign each element to a subset.First element is 6. Since target is 6, the first subset can take 6. So subsets[0] becomes 6. Then proceed to next element, 5. The target is 6, so subsets can take 5. Try adding to subsets[0] (sum 6+5=11&gt;6 → invalid). So subsets[1] is 5. Then next element is 4. Now, subsets[0] is 6, subsets[1] is 5. Adding 4 to subsets[1] (sum 5+4=9&gt;6 → no). So subsets[2] is 4. Then next element is 2. Assign to subsets[0] (6+2=8&gt;6). Subsets[1] is 5, add 2 → 7&gt;6. Subsets[2] is 4 → add 2 → 6. So subsets[2] becomes 6. Then next element is 1. Assign to subsets[0] (sum 6+1=7&gt;6). Subsets[1] is 5 → add 1 → 6. So all subsets are filled. So returns True.But perhaps in the code, after the first element (6) is added to subset 0, the next element 5 can be added to subset 1. Then 4 is added to subset 2. Then 2 can be added to subset 2 (4+2=6), then 1 added to subset 1 (5+1=6). So yes.So the code should find this.But the code needs to be written correctly.Now, the code for the backtracking function.But in the code example I wrote earlier, the function sorts the array in reverse order. Then, the backtracking function starts with index 0, and for each element, tries to put it into each subset. But with the optimization that if two subsets have the same current sum, and adding the element to either would be the same, then we skip. This is to avoid redundant work.Another optimization is that once a subset is filled (sum reaches target), we can ignore it for other elements. Wait, no. For example, once a subset is filled, any further elements can&#39;t be added to it. So in the code, the subsets are allowed to have sum up to target. So when subsets[i] + current element &lt;= target, we can add it.But once a subset&#39;s sum is target, adding any element to it would make it exceed. So in practice, once a subset is filled (sum == target), no elements can be added to it. So in the code, during the backtracking, when we process the next elements, the subsets that are already filled (sum == target) will have subsets[i] + array[index] &gt; target, so they are skipped.Thus, the code can handle filled subsets automatically.Now, the code for the problem.So, the plan is:Implement the backtracking approach with the necessary optimizations.But wait, for the problem&#39;s constraints, this approach may work.Now, in Python, recursion depth may be a problem. But for N=21, recursion depth is 21, which is acceptable.Now, code structure:The function will read T test cases.For each test case:Read N and K.Read the list of intensities.Check if K is zero (but per constraints, no). Then check if K &gt; N → output no.Else compute sum. Check sum % K. If not zero → no.Else compute target. Check if any element is larger than target → no.Else sort the array in reverse order.Then, call the backtracking function to see if the partition is possible.If yes → output yes, else no.Now, let&#39;s code the backtracking function.But in Python, for efficiency, we can implement memoization, but perhaps it&#39;s not needed. Let&#39;s code the backtracking as a helper function.Wait, but the code for the backtracking function in Python can be written as follows:def can_divide(nums, k):    total = sum(nums)    if total % k != 0:        return False    target = total // k    nums.sort(reverse=True)    if nums[0] &gt; target:        return False    n = len(nums)    # We need to split into k subsets, each sum to target.    # We can use backtracking.    # To optimize, we track the subsets, and for each step, assign the current number to a subset.    # Also, to avoid duplicate work, we can skip subsets that are the same as previous ones.    # So, the approach is to try placing the current number into a subset, but skipping subsets that are equal to previous ones.    # Also, start with the largest numbers first to fail early.    # The code is as follows:    subset_sums = [0] * k    def backtrack(index):        if index == n:            return True        current = nums[index]        for i in range(k):            if subset_sums[i] + current &lt;= target:                # To avoid duplicate processing:                if i &gt; 0 and subset_sums[i] == subset_sums[i-1]:                    continue                subset_sums[i] += current                if backtrack(index + 1):                    return True                subset_sums[i] -= current                # If adding to an empty subset and it didn&#39;t work, then no need to try others.                if subset_sums[i] == 0:                    break        return False    return backtrack(0)Wait, but in this code, after adding the current element to subset i, and if the backtrack returns False, we backtrack (subtract the element). Also, if the subset sum becomes zero after backtracking (i.e., we tried adding the element to subset i, but that didn&#39;t work, and after subtracting, the sum is zero again), then we break. Because if a subset is empty, adding the current element to it and failing, then adding to another empty subset is redundant. So this is another optimization.So, for example, if the current element is the first element being placed, and all subsets are empty. So we can place it in the first subset. If that doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s no need to try placing it in other subsets, since they are all the same (empty). So this can reduce the branching factor.This is a crucial optimization.So, the code above includes this optimization.Therefore, this code should work for the given constraints.Now, testing with the sample input.Sample Input 1:25 31 2 4 5 6 → sum is 18. target 6.After sorting in reverse: [6,5,4,2,1]The backtracking starts.subset_sums = [0,0,0]index 0: current is 6.i=0: subset_sums[0] +6 =6 &lt;=6. So subset_sums becomes [6,0,0]. Then proceed to index 1 (5).At index 1, current is 5.Loop i in 0,1,2.i=0: 6+5=11&gt;6 → no.i=1: subset_sums[1] is 0. add 5 →5 &lt;=6. Now, check if i&gt;0 and subset_sums[i-1] (subset_sums[0] is 6). 0 !=6 → proceed.So subset_sums becomes [6,5,0].Next, index 2 (current=4). For i in 0,1,2.i=0: 6+4=10&gt;6 → no.i=1:5+4=9&gt;6 → no.i=2:0+4=4 &lt;=6. Add 4 to subset 2. Now subset_sums [6,5,4].Proceed to index 3 (current=2).Loop i=0,1,2.i=0:6+2=8&gt;6 → no.i=1:5+2=7&gt;6 → no.i=2:4+2=6 &lt;=6. Add 2 → subset 2 becomes 6. Now proceed to index 4 (current=1).Loop i=0,1,2.i=0:6+1=7&gt;6 → no.i=1:5+1=6 → add. subset_sums becomes [6,6,6]. Then index 5 (n=5) → return True.Thus, returns yes.The second test case: sum 1+2+4+5+7=19. 19%3 !=0 → returns no.Thus, the code would work for the sample input.Now, edge cases to consider:Test case where K=1. Then all elements must be in one subset. So return yes.Test case where N=K. Each follower gets exactly one sanskar. The sum must be same for all. So the sum of all elements divided by K must be equal to each element. So in this case, all elements must be equal. Otherwise, impossible.Another case: K=2, N=3. Sum must be even. If elements are 3,3,0. sum 6, target 3. Then possible? 3 in one subset, 3 in another, and 0 can go to either. So yes.Now, in code.Now, implementing this in Python.But since N can be up to 21, and K up to 8, the code must handle that. But with the optimizations, it should be manageable.Another thing: for very large intensity values (up to 1e10), but the code doesn&#39;t have any issues with that, as Python handles big integers.Now, the code.So the code reads T test cases. For each:Read N and K.Read N integers.Check if K is 0 (but per constraints, K &gt;=1, so no need). But check if K &gt; N → output &#39;no&#39; (since each follower needs at least one sanskar, and if K&gt;N, it&#39;s impossible).Wait, yes. For example, if K=3 and N=2. Then you can&#39;t split into 3 subsets each with at least one element. So the code needs to first check if K &gt; N. If yes, output &#39;no&#39;.Thus, the code must include this check.So, the steps are:For each test case:n, k = map(int, input().split())nums = list of numbers.if k &gt; n:   print(&#39;no&#39;)else:   check sum.So, code steps:Read T.For T times:read N and K.read list of N integers.if K &gt; N:   print &#39;no&#39;else:   sum_total = sum(nums)   if sum_total % K !=0:       print &#39;no&#39;   else:       target = sum_total // K       if any num &gt; target → &#39;no&#39;       else:           proceed to backtracking.So in code:def solve():    import sys    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    ptr = 0    T = int(input[ptr])    ptr +=1    for _ in range(T):        N = int(input[ptr])        K = int(input[ptr+1])        ptr +=2        nums = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+N]))        ptr += N        if K &gt; N:            print(&quot;no&quot;)            continue        total = sum(nums)        if total % K !=0:            print(&quot;no&quot;)            continue        target = total // K        if any(x &gt; target for x in nums):            print(&quot;no&quot;)            continue        # Now, proceed to backtracking.        nums.sort(reverse=True)        subset_sums = [0]*K        can_assign = False        # Implement backtracking with optimizations.        # The backtrack function.        def backtrack(index):            if index == N:                return True            current = nums[index]            for i in range(K):                if subset_sums[i] + current &lt;= target:                    # Skip duplicates.                    if i &gt;0 and subset_sums[i] == subset_sums[i-1]:                        continue                    subset_sums[i] += current                    if backtrack(index+1):                        return True                    subset_sums[i] -= current                    # If the subset is now 0, no need to proceed.                    if subset_sums[i] ==0:                        break            return False        if backtrack(0):            print(&quot;yes&quot;)        else:            print(&quot;no&quot;)But this code may not be efficient enough for N=21 and K=8.But given the problem constraints, perhaps it&#39;s manageable.Testing the sample input:Sample Input 1:25 31 2 4 5 65 31 2 4 5 7Sample Output:yesnoAs the code correctly handles.Another test case where K=2, N=3, nums=[3,3,0]. Sum is 6, target 3. So code returns yes.Another test case where K=2, nums = [4,4,4,4], sum 16. K=2. Target 8. So each subset must sum to 8. So possible: 4+4 each. So code returns yes.Another case where K=3, N=3. All elements 2. So sum 6, target 2. Each gets one 2. So yes.But if N=3, K=3 and elements are 1,1,2. Sum 4, not divisible by 3 → no.So code should handle these.But for larger N and K, the code may take time. But the problem&#39;s constraints are small enough (N=21, K=8) that even with backtracking, it&#39;s manageable.Now, let&#39;s write the code as a Python function that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.The code reads all input at once, splits into a list, processes each test case as per the code above.Now, the code must call the function after defining it.Thus, the final code would be:Read all input.Process each test case as outlined.Now, let&#39;s code this.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can evenly divide a list of integers (sanskars) into K subsets (followers) such that each subset has the same sum. This problem can be approached using a backtracking algorithm with optimizations to handle the constraints efficiently. Approach1. Initial Checks:   - If the number of followers (K) is greater than the number of sanskars (N), it&#39;s impossible to divide them, so we immediately return &quot;no&quot;.   - Calculate the total sum of the sanskars. If this sum is not divisible by K, it&#39;s impossible to divide them equally, so return &quot;no&quot;.   - Determine the target sum for each subset, which is the total sum divided by K. If any sanskar&#39;s intensity exceeds this target sum, return &quot;no&quot; as it can&#39;t be included in any subset.2. Backtracking with Optimizations:   - Sort the sanskars in descending order to facilitate early pruning of invalid branches in the search.   - Use a backtracking approach to try placing each sanskar into a subset, ensuring the subset&#39;s sum does not exceed the target.   - Skip redundant work by avoiding placing the same number into subsets with the same current sum and by breaking early if placing a number into an empty subset doesn&#39;t lead to a solution.

It skips redundant checks by avoiding placing the same element into subsets with the same current sum and breaks early if an element cannot be placed into an empty subset.This approach efficiently prunes the search space and leverages sorting and early termination to handle the constraints effectively.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-30f0ed69 data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review" data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review-title" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>❓:</span>Recall that a permutation of length n is an array where each element from 1 to n occurs exactly once.For a fixed positive integer d, let&#39;s define the cost of the permutation p of length n as the number of indices i (1 le i &lt; n) such that p_i cdot d = p_{i + 1}.For example, if d = 3 and p = [5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3, 4], then the cost of such a permutation is 2, because p_2 cdot 3 = p_3 and p_5 cdot 3 = p_6.Your task is the following one: for a given value n, find the permutation of length n and the value d with maximum possible cost (over all ways to choose the permutation and d).

So the task is to find for a given n, a permutation and a d such that the cost is maximized. The cost is the number of times consecutive elements in the permutation satisfy p_i * d = p_{i+1}. Hmm, first I need to understand how to maximize this cost. Let&#39;s think about the maximum possible cost. For each possible d, we can arrange the permutation in such a way that as many consecutive pairs as possible have the next element equal to d times the previous. But how do we choose d and the permutation structure to maximize this?Let me think of some examples. For n=2, the sample input gives d=2 and permutation [1,2]. Here, 1*2=2, so cost is 1. That&#39;s the maximum possible because the only other possible permutation is [2,1], which gives 0. So d=2 is optimal here.For n=3, the sample output is d=3 and permutation [2,1,3]. Let&#39;s see: 2*3=6, which is not 1. Then 1*3=3, which is the next element. So cost is 1. Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a better arrangement. For example, if d=2, can we get two pairs? Let&#39;s see. Suppose the permutation is [1,2,4], but wait n=3. Oh right, the elements must be 1 to 3. So for d=2, possible sequences could be 1,2 (since 1*2=2) and then 3. So the permutation would be [1,2,3]. The cost here is 1 (from 1*2=2). Then maybe another arrangement for d=3. Like [3,1,2]. Here, 3*3=9 not 1. Then 1*3=3 not 2. So cost 0. So the sample&#39;s approach gives cost 1, which is the maximum possible here.Wait, but in the sample output for n=3, the permutation is [2,1,3]. The pairs are 2*3=6 (no), 1*3=3 (yes). So cost 1. So that&#39;s the maximum possible. So the sample&#39;s approach must be generating a permutation where d is as large as possible, and arranging elements such that each element is followed by a multiple. But how?Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to chain elements in such a way that each element is followed by d times itself, but since elements can&#39;t exceed n, this chain can only be as long as possible for a certain d.So the idea is to select a d, and then form a chain starting from x, then x*d, then x*d^2, etc., until it&#39;s no longer possible. Then the maximum number of consecutive pairs is the length of the chain minus 1. But how to maximize this across all possible d.But how do we choose which d and which chains to form? Because the permutation has to include all elements from 1 to n, so the chains must cover all elements.Wait, perhaps the optimal d is the largest possible, which would be n, but that might not be possible. Let&#39;s see. For example, when n=3, d=3. Then the chain could be 1, 3 (since 1*3=3). But that&#39;s two elements. Then 2 is left. So the permutation could be [2,1,3], which gives cost 1. Alternatively, [1,3,2], which gives cost 1 (since 1*3=3). So same cost. So in that case, d=3 gives cost 1, which is the maximum possible.So maybe the optimal d is the maximum possible, which would be the largest possible d such that there exists at least one pair (x, x*d) in the permutation. Then, arranging those pairs into the permutation as much as possible.Another approach: For a given d, the maximum possible cost is the number of times you can have x followed by x*d in the permutation. So the problem is to choose d such that the number of such pairs is maximized.So how to model this. For each possible d, compute how many x are in [1..n] such that x*d is also in [1..n]. Then, the maximum of these counts would be the maximum possible cost for that d. Then, among all d, select the one with the maximum count, and arrange the permutation accordingly.But how do we find this d efficiently?But for n up to 2e5, trying all possible d for each test case is O(n), which for t=500 would be 1e8 operations. That&#39;s probably too slow.So we need a smarter approach.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s a way to find the d that maximizes the number of x where x*d &lt;=n. Because each such x contributes a possible edge in the permutation.For example, for a given d, the number of x is floor(n/(d)) - floor(n/(d^2))? No, wait. Wait, x must be such that x*d &lt;=n, and x must be in the permutation. Wait, for each x where x*d is &lt;=n, then x and x*d can form a pair. But each such pair contributes +1 to the cost. However, these pairs can&#39;t overlap. For example, if x is followed by x*d, then x*d can be followed by x*d^2, if that&#39;s &lt;=n. So the chain x → x*d → x*d^2 → ... → x*d^k, where each term is &lt;=n. Then the number of edges in this chain is k. So the total edges for this d would be the sum over all chains of their lengths minus 1.Hmm. So the total cost for a particular d is the sum for each starting x (which is not part of any longer chain) of (length of chain -1).For example, take d=2, n=8. Then possible chains:1 → 2 →4 →8 (length 4, edges 3)3 →6 (edges 1)5 → (no)7 → (no)So total edges 3+1=4.But if we arrange the permutation as 1,2,4,8,3,6,5,7, then the cost is 3+1=4. That&#39;s for d=2.Alternatively, for d=3, n=8.Chains:1→3→9 (but 9&gt;8), so chain is 1→3 (edge 1)2→6 (edge 1)4→12&gt;8 (edge 0)5→15&gt;8 (edge 0)7→21&gt;8 (edge 0)So total edges 2.So d=2 is better here.So for a given d, the maximum possible cost is the sum over the lengths of all chains minus the number of chains. Because each chain of length k contributes k-1 edges.But how to compute this efficiently?Alternatively, the maximum possible cost for a given d is equal to the number of elements in the permutation that have a predecessor in their chain.So for each d, the number of x in 1..n such that x is not divisible by d, and x*d is in the permutation. Because if x is not divisible by d, then x can start a chain. If x is divisible by d (like x=4 and d=2), then x would be part of a longer chain (like 2 →4).So perhaps the optimal d is the one that allows the maximum number of such x, and the permutation should be arranged as a sequence of chains for that d.But how to choose the best d?Alternatively, the maximum possible cost is the maximum possible number of edges in the permutation. For any permutation, each edge contributes 1 to the cost for some d. But we have to choose a single d and arrange the permutation to maximize the edges for that d.So the problem reduces to finding a d and a way to arrange the permutation as a sequence of chains for that d, such that the sum of (chain length -1) for each chain is maximized.To maximize the sum, we need as many chains as possible, but also as long as possible.But how to find the d that maximizes this sum?An alternative approach: For each d, the maximum number of edges is equal to the number of elements in the permutation that are in chains of length &gt;=2. Because each chain of length k contributes k-1 edges.So the goal is to find the d that maximizes the total number of elements in chains (for that d) minus the number of chains (since sum (k-1) = sum k - number of chains, and sum k is the total elements in chains).But this seems a bit vague. Let&#39;s think of another angle.What&#39;s the maximum possible cost possible? For example, when n is a power of 2, d=2. The permutation can be arranged in a chain like 1,2,4,8,..., and then the other numbers arranged in a way that their chains are as long as possible. For example, n=4: 1,2,4,3. Then cost is 2 (1→2, 2→4). So maximum possible for d=2.But for d=2, the maximum possible cost for n=8 would be 3 (from 1→2→4→8) plus 1 (from 3→6) plus 0 for 5 and 7. So total 4.But what if we choose d=3. For n=9, the chain would be 1→3→9. Then 2→6, 4→12 (invalid), etc. So for d=3, sum (k-1) would be (3-1)+(2-1) = 2+1=3. So d=2 gives higher cost.So perhaps the optimal d is the smallest possible d (like d=2) because it allows more chains. Wait, but in the sample input for n=2, d=2 is chosen. For n=3, d=3 is chosen. So maybe it&#39;s better to choose the largest possible d.Wait, in the sample input for n=3, the maximum possible cost is 1, achieved by d=3. If we had chosen d=2, then the permutation could be [1,2,3], which gives cost 1. So same cost. But why does the sample choose d=3? Because perhaps when there are multiple possible d with the same maximum cost, we can choose any. So in that case, the sample&#39;s output is one possible solution.So the approach here is to find a d where the sum of (chain lengths -1) is maximum.But how to compute this for each n efficiently?Alternative idea: The optimal d is the maximum possible such that there exists at least one x where x*d &lt;=n. Because for larger d, the chain length is 2 (x → x*d). So each such x gives a cost of 1. The number of such x is floor(n/d). But then for d=2, floor(n/2) could be higher.Wait, but for d=3 and n=3, floor(n/d) is 1. So 1 chain of length 2, cost 1. For d=2, floor(3/2) is 1. So same. So the maximum cost is the same for both d=2 and d=3. So perhaps in such cases, we can choose the maximum d possible.So maybe the optimal approach is to choose d as the largest possible such that there exists at least one x where x*d &lt;=n. Then, arrange the permutation in a way that all such x and x*d are consecutive.But how to handle multiple chains for that d?Alternatively, for a given d, the maximum number of pairs is floor(n/d) - the number of multiples of d that are also divisible by d^2. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think again. For d=2, the possible x are all x where x*2 &lt;=n. But x can&#39;t be a multiple of d (i.e., even in this case) because otherwise, x would have been part of a longer chain. Wait, no. For example, x=2, d=2. Then x*d=4. So x=2 is part of a chain if there&#39;s a 1 before it. Like 1→2→4→8. So the chains are formed by numbers that are not divisible by d. Because if x is divisible by d, then x/d would have been part of a chain.So for a given d, the chains are formed by x that are not divisible by d. For each such x, the maximum chain length is the maximum k where x *d^{k-1} &lt;=n.So for d, the number of chains is the number of x in 1..n where x is not divisible by d and x*d &lt;=n. For each such x, the chain length is the maximum possible steps. For example, x=1, d=2, n=8: 1*2=2 → 2*2=4 →4*2=8 → 8*2=16 (exceeds n). So chain length is 3 steps (1→2→4→8), which gives 3 edges (3 steps -1). So each x in this group contributes (chain length -1) to the total cost.But how to compute this for all possible d?Alternatively, perhaps the optimal d is the maximum possible d where floor(n/(d)) &gt;=1. Because for larger d, the maximum chain length is 2, and each x gives 1 edge. So the maximum possible d is floor(n/1) =n. But that&#39;s not possible. For example, for d=n, the only possible x is 1, but 1*d =n. So if d=n, then the chain is 1→n, giving 1 edge. But for d=2 and n=3, this gives 1 edge. So for d=n, the maximum possible cost is 1. But perhaps for some other d, like d=2, the cost is higher.So perhaps the optimal d is the maximum possible d where the sum of the chain lengths (minus number of chains) is maximized. But how to compute this?Alternatively, perhaps the optimal d is the smallest possible d. Like d=2. For example, for n=4, d=2 gives a chain of 1→2→4, cost 2. For d=3, there&#39;s 1→3 (if 3*3=9 &gt;4). So cost 1. So d=2 is better.But for n=3, d=3 gives cost 1, same as d=2. So the maximum possible cost can be achieved by either d=2 or d=3, but the sample chooses d=3.So perhaps the best approach is to choose the largest possible d where the number of edges is maximum.But how to compute this.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the maximum possible cost. For a permutation, each edge (i, i+1) where p_i *d =p_{i+1} contributes to the cost. The maximum possible cost is the maximum number of such edges possible.The key is that each edge is a pair (x, x*d) where x*d &lt;=n. So the problem reduces to finding a d where the maximum number of such pairs exist, and arrange them in the permutation such that each x is followed by x*d, and the other elements are arranged in a way that doesn&#39;t form any such pairs.But how to choose d such that the number of such pairs is maximum.So the problem becomes, for each possible d, compute the number of x in 1..n where x*d &lt;=n. Then, the maximum of these over d is the maximum possible cost.But wait, this is not exactly correct. Because if x is a multiple of d, then x could be part of a longer chain. For example, x=2, d=2: x*d=4. So 2 is part of the chain 1→2→4. So here, x=2 is not counted as a starting x. So the starting x must be numbers not divisible by d.So for d, the maximum number of pairs is the count of x in 1..n where x is not divisible by d, and x*d is &lt;=n. Because each such x starts a chain of at least length 2, contributing one pair. If x*d^2 is &lt;=n, then the chain length is longer, contributing more pairs. So the total pairs for d is the sum for each x (not divisible by d) of the maximum k where x*d^k &lt;=n. Then, the total pairs is sum (k) for all x in the starting set.But how to compute this efficiently.Alternatively, for each d, the number of starting x (not divisible by d) is equal to the number of x in 1..n where x is not divisible by d, and x*d &lt;=n. So for each such x, the chain length is floor( log_d (n/x) ) + 1. Then, the number of edges is (chain length -1) for each x.But this seems computationally heavy for large n.But perhaps there&#39;s a way to approximate this. For each d, the number of starting x is floor(n/(d)) - floor(n/(d^2)). Because x can be up to floor(n/d), but x can&#39;t be divisible by d, which would have x &gt;=d. So the count is floor(n/d) minus the count of x divisible by d (i.e., x can be written as d *k, where k &lt;= floor(n/(d^2)) ). So the count is floor(n/d) - floor(n/(d^2)).But even if that&#39;s the case, the chain length for each x is 1 (if x*d^2 &gt;n) or longer. For example, if x*d^2 &lt;=n, then the chain can be x →x*d →x*d^2 → ... until x*d^k &lt;=n.So for each x in the starting set (x not divisible by d, x*d &lt;=n), the number of edges contributed is the maximum k where x*d^k &lt;=n. Then, sum over all x (k).But how to compute this sum for all possible d.This seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern or a way to find the optimal d without having to compute all possibilities.Alternatively, perhaps the optimal d is the one that maximizes the number of x where x*d &lt;=n and x is not divisible by d. And then, arrange the permutation to include as many of these x →x*d pairs as possible.So the count of such x is floor(n/d) - floor(n/(d^2)). So we need to find d that maximizes this value.Let me see for some values.Take n=3.For d=2: floor(3/2)=1. floor(3/4)=0. So count is 1-0=1.For d=3: floor(3/3)=1. floor(3/9)=0. count is 1-0=1.So both d=2 and d=3 have count 1. So maximum is 1. So which d to choose? The sample chooses d=3.So perhaps when multiple d have the same maximum count, we choose the largest possible d.So the approach is:- For each n, find the largest d such that (floor(n/d) - floor(n/(d^2))) is maximized.Once we have that d, construct the permutation by arranging all the chains for d, and then the remaining elements in any order that doesn&#39;t form new edges.So the next step is to find, for each n, the d that maximizes (floor(n/d) - floor(n/d^2)), and among all such d&#39;s, choose the largest possible.Wait, but is that the correct approach? Let&#39;s take another example.For n=4:Possible d&#39;s:d=2: floor(4/2)=2, floor(4/4)=1. 2-1=1.d=3: floor(4/3)=1, floor(4/9)=0. 1-0=1.d=4: floor(4/4)=1, floor(4/16)=0. 1-0=1.So the maximum is 1 for d=2,3,4. Choose the largest d, which is 4. Then the count is 1. But for d=2, the count is 1, but the actual number of edges can be higher. For example, for d=2, x can be 1 and 3. 1*2=2, 2*2=4. So chain length for x=1 is 2 (edges 1), x=3: 3*2=6&gt;4. So total edges 1. But according to the formula, the count is 2-1=1. So the actual edges is 1, which matches the formula&#39;s count. For d=4, the x is 1. 1*4=4. So edges 1. So same.But in reality, for d=2, you can arrange the permutation as 3,1,2,4. Which gives two edges: 1→2 and 2→4. Wait, how? Because 3 is not part of any chain. Wait, 3 is not a starting x for d=2. Because 3*2=6&gt;4, so x=3 is not in the starting set. So for d=2, the starting x is 1 (since 1*2=2&lt;=4, and 1 is not divisible by 2). Then the chain is 1→2→4. So the edges are 2. So the actual count is 2 edges, but according to the formula, the count is 1. So this suggests that the formula is not accurate.Wait, this indicates that the formula is wrong. So there&#39;s a problem with this approach.Wait, the formula floor(n/d) - floor(n/(d^2)) gives the number of x where x*d &lt;=n and x is not divisible by d. For d=2, n=4:floor(4/2) =2. floor(4/(2^2))=1. So 2-1=1. So the formula says there&#39;s one x. But for x=1 and x=3, x*d=2 and 6. But x=3*d=6&gt;4. So only x=1 is valid. So count is 1. But in the permutation, the chain is 1→2→4, which contributes two edges. So the formula&#39;s count is 1, but the actual edges is 2. So the formula is not capturing the chain length.Ah, right. So the formula gives the number of starting x (those not divisible by d and x*d &lt;=n), but each such x can form a chain of varying lengths. For example, x=1, d=2, n=4: chain length is 3 (elements 1,2,4), edges 2. So the number of edges contributed by x=1 is 2. But the formula&#39;s count is 1.So the formula is not sufficient. The initial approach was incorrect.So the original problem is more complex than just finding the maximum number of starting x. We need to find the d that maximizes the sum over all x (not divisible by d) of the maximum chain length starting at x, minus 1.So for each x in the starting set, the chain length is the maximum k where x*d^{k-1} &lt;=n. The sum over all such (k-1) is the total edges for d.But calculating this sum for each d is computationally expensive for large n.Alternative idea: For each x in 1..n, find the maximum d such that x*d &lt;=n, and x is not divisible by d. Then, for each d, accumulate the number of possible chains. But this seems difficult.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about for each d, the maximum possible edges. The edges are the number of times you can multiply by d and stay within n. For example, for d=2 and x=1, the edges are 2 (1→2, 2→4). So each such x contributes floor(log_d (n/x)) ) edges.So the total edges for d is the sum over all x (not divisible by d, x*d &lt;=n) of floor( log_d (n/x) )But how to compute this efficiently.Alternatively, for a given d, the maximum possible edges is the sum for each x in starting set (x not divisible by d, x*d &lt;=n) of the maximum k where x*d^{k} &lt;=n.So for x=1, d=2, n=4: x*d^1 =2, x*d^2=4, x*d^3=8&gt;4. So k=2. So edges is 2.For x=1, d=3, n=3: x*d=3, x*d^2=9&gt;3. So edges 1.So for each starting x, edges += k, where k is the maximum such that x*d^k &lt;=n.So the problem is to find d that maximizes this sum.But how?Alternatively, for each d, the sum is equal to the number of elements in the permutation that are part of some chain (for d) minus the number of chains. Because each chain of m elements contributes (m-1) edges.For example, a chain of 3 elements (like 1→2→4 for d=2) contributes 2 edges. So sum is (3-1) =2.So the total edges for d is (number of elements in all chains) - (number of chains).But how to compute the number of elements in all chains.Another approach: For a given d, the elements in chains are exactly those numbers that can be written as x*d^k, where x is not divisible by d and k &gt;=0, and x*d^k &lt;=n.The number of elements in chains is the sum over x (not divisible by d) of the maximum k where x*d^k &lt;=n, plus 1 (since k starts at 0).Then, the total edges is (sum (k_max) for x) - number of chains (since each chain contributes k_max edges, which is (k_max) since the number of edges is k_max).Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let me think again.Each chain starts with x (not divisible by d). Then x*d, x*d^2, etc., up to x*d^m &lt;=n. So the number of elements in the chain is m+1. The number of edges is m. So for each x, the edges contributed are m.The sum of m for all x is the total edges.But m = floor( log_d (n/x) ), since x*d^m &lt;=n &lt;x*d^{m+1}.So the total edges is sum_{x} floor( log_d (n/x) ), where x is not divisible by d, and x*d &lt;=n.But this is difficult to compute for each d.Alternative idea: For d to be optimal, it&#39;s likely that the chains are as long as possible, which implies that d is as small as possible (since smaller d allows more multiplications before exceeding n). For example, d=2 allows for longer chains than d=3. So perhaps the optimal d is the smallest possible.But the sample input for n=3 has d=3. Which is the largest possible. So this contradicts the idea.Hmm. So perhaps for some n, the optimal d is the largest possible, and for others, it&#39;s the smallest.This suggests that there&#39;s no single pattern, and we need a way to compute the best d for each n.But given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to find for each n the d that maximizes the number of edges, and construct the permutation accordingly.But how?Alternative approach inspired by the sample:In the sample for n=2, the permutation is [1,2], d=2. This gives one edge. For n=3, the permutation is [2,1,3], d=3. This gives one edge (1*3=3).But why not arrange the permutation for d=2 in the second case? For example, [1,2,3]. Then 1*2=2, giving one edge, same as the sample. So in this case, both d=2 and d=3 give the same number of edges. But the sample chooses the larger d.So the strategy for the problem seems to be:- Find the largest possible d such that there exists at least one x where x*d &lt;=n, and arrange the permutation such that all such x&#39;s chains are included.But how does that maximize the number of edges?Because when d is large, the chains are shorter (each x can only form x → x*d, which is one edge), but the number of such x&#39;s could be higher.Alternatively, when d is small, the chains can be longer, but the number of x&#39;s that can form chains may be higher.This is a trade-off. For example, d=2 can allow many x&#39;s with longer chains, while d=3 may have fewer x&#39;s but each contributes one edge.But how to find the optimal d.Another observation: For each d, the maximum number of edges is the number of x not divisible by d such that x*d &lt;=n, multiplied by the length of their chains. But this depends on how long each chain is.But perhaps the optimal d is the largest possible. Let&#39;s see.For example, when n=3:d=3: x=1 (1*3=3). Chain length is 2 (1 →3). Edges=1.d=2: x=1 (1*2=2). Chain length is 2 (1→2). x=3 (3*2=6&gt;3). So edges=1.So maximum edges for both d=2 and d=3 is 1. So sample chooses d=3.Another example, n=4:Possible d:d=4: x=1 →4. edges=1.d=3: x=1 →3. edges=1.d=2: x=1 →2→4 (edges=2), x=3 →6&gt;4 (edges=0). total edges=2.So d=2 is better.So in this case, a smaller d gives more edges.So the previous idea of choosing the largest possible d is not correct.So what&#39;s the pattern here? For d=2, chains can be longer, leading to more edges.So perhaps the optimal d is the one where the sum of chain edges is the maximum. For each d, calculate this sum, and pick the maximum.But how to calculate this sum efficiently.Alternative approach inspired by the chain structure:To maximize the number of edges, arrange the permutation to have as many chains as possible for a certain d. The best d would be the one that allows the maximum number of edges. For a given d, the number of edges is the sum over all chains of (length of chain -1).So the problem reduces to finding d that maximizes this sum.To find this, perhaps for each possible d, we can compute the sum of chain lengths minus the number of chains. But again, this is computationally expensive for large n.Alternatively, for each possible d, the maximum sum of edges is the number of times d divides into numbers in the permutation. For example, each time we have x followed by x*d.But I&#39;m not sure.Alternative idea inspired by the initial examples:The optimal d is the largest possible d where there&#39;s at least one x where x*d &lt;=n. But for d= floor(n/1) =n, x=1 →d= n. So edges 1. But perhaps for some smaller d, there are more edges.So maybe the optimal d is the one that allows the maximum number of edges, which could vary depending on n.But how to compute this.Another way to think: the maximum possible edges for a permutation is floor(log_2 n), since the longest possible chain is 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., which has log2(n) steps. For example, n=8 gives 3 edges (1→2→4→8). So for d=2, this chain contributes 3 edges, which is more than any other d.But how often is this the case.For n=5:d=2: 1→2→4 (edges 2), 3→6&gt;5 (edges 0). So total edges 2.d=3: 1→3 (edges 1), 2→6&gt;5. So edges 1.d=5: 1→5. edges 1.So d=2 is better.So the optimal d here is 2.So perhaps the optimal d is the smallest possible (d=2) for larger n.But for n=3, the sample&#39;s d=3 is also optimal. So there&#39;s a contradiction.Hmm. So the optimal d depends on n. For small n, the best d may be larger. For larger n, the best d is smaller.But how to find this for each n.Alternative approach inspired by trying to find the pattern in the sample:Looking at the sample input:Test case 1: n=2. Output d=2, permutation [1,2]. Cost 1.Test case 2: n=3. Output d=3, permutation [2,1,3]. Cost 1.But for n=3, what if we choose d=2 and permutation [1,2,3]. The cost is 1. So same as sample. So why choose d=3?The sample&#39;s approach may have a different pattern. For example, the permutation is arranged such that the first element is the largest possible starting element for the chain.Alternatively, the permutation is built by taking all the chains for the chosen d and concatenating them in a certain order, then adding the remaining elements.But how to construct the permutation once d is chosen.Another example: n=4, d=2. The chains are 1→2→4, and 3. So permutation could be [1,2,4,3]. Cost 2.So the permutation includes the chain elements first, followed by the remaining elements.But what if the remaining elements can form their own chains. For example, n=6, d=2. The chains are 1→2→4, 3→6, 5. So permutation would be [1,2,4,3,6,5]. Cost 3.But for d=3, the chains would be 1→3, 2→6. Cost 2.So d=2 is better.So for larger n, d=2 tends to give more edges.But how to determine this for each n.Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal approach is to choose d as the largest possible such that there exists at least one x where x*d &lt;=n. Then, construct the permutation by including the chain(s) for that d, followed by the remaining elements arranged in a way that they do not form any edges for that d.But how to generate the permutation.Let&#39;s think of the permutation construction steps:Once we have chosen d, we need to arrange all elements in such a way that each x in the chains is followed by x*d, and the remaining elements are arranged in any order that doesn&#39;t create any such pairs.The way to do this is to:1. Generate all the chains for the chosen d.Each chain starts with a number not divisible by d, and then multiplies by d until exceeding n.For example, for d=2 and n=8:Chains:1 →2 →4 →83 →65 →10 (exceeds)7 →14 (exceeds)So the chains are [1,2,4,8], [3,6].The remaining elements are 5,7.So the permutation can be arranged as:[1,2,4,8,3,6,5,7]. This gives edges 3 (from 1→2→4→8) and 1 (3→6). Total 4.But how to generate the chains.The steps to generate the chains are:- For each x from 1 to n:   - if x is not divisible by d, and x*d &lt;=n:      - start a chain with x, then multiply by d until exceeding n.   - else:      - add to the remaining elements.So for each x in 1..n:   - if x is not in any chain and is not divisible by d and x*d &lt;=n:      - create a chain.So the algorithm for generating chains is:chains = []used = set()for x in 1..n:   if x not in used and x %d !=0 and x*d &lt;=n:       current = x       chain = []       while current &lt;=n:           chain.append(current)           used.add(current)           current *=d       chains.append(chain)remaining = sorted([x for x in 1..n if x not in used])Then, the permutation is the concatenation of all chains in some order, followed by the remaining elements.But the order of the chains and remaining elements could affect the cost. For example, if two chains are placed consecutively, but their last element and next chain&#39;s first element form a valid pair for d, then it would add an extra edge. So we need to arrange the chains and remaining elements in a way that no such consecutive pairs are formed.The simplest way is to arrange the chains in any order, and the remaining elements in any order, but ensuring that no element from the remaining is placed between elements of the chains.So the permutation can be constructed by concatenating all chains and appending the remaining elements.The chains can be ordered in any way. For example, sorted in increasing order of their starting elements.Once the permutation is constructed, the cost is the sum of (chain length -1) for all chains, as each chain contributes exactly (length-1) edges.So the problem now reduces to:For each test case:1. Find the optimal d (the one that maximizes the sum of (chain length -1) over all chains).2. Generate the permutation as per the chains and remaining elements.But how to find the optimal d.Given the time constraints for code submission, perhaps the optimal d is the largest possible d for which there exists at least one x where x*d &lt;=n. But this is not correct for all cases.Alternative idea: The optimal d is the largest possible d that is a divisor of (n) or something similar.Alternatively, we can try all possible d for each n up to sqrt(n) and find the one that gives the maximum sum. But for n up to 2e5 and t=500, this would be too slow.But perhaps there&#39;s a pattern.Another observation: For a given d, the number of edges is the sum of the lengths of all chains minus the number of chains. So sum (k) for each chain, where k is the length of the chain minus 1. So it&#39;s equal to (total elements in chains) - number of chains.For example, in the case of d=2 and n=8:Total elements in chains: 4 (1,2,4,8) + 2 (3,6) =6.Number of chains: 2.Sum edges:6-2=4.Which matches the earlier example.So the problem is to find d that maximizes (total elements in chains) - (number of chains).But how to compute this for all possible d.But what is the maximum possible value of (total elements in chains) - (number of chains).Hmm.Alternatively, since each chain is formed by x not divisible by d, and then multiplied by d as much as possible, perhaps the optimal d is the one that maximizes the number of elements in chains, but with as few chains as possible.But how.Another idea: For a given d, the number of elements in chains is equal to the number of elements that are in some chain. Which is the same as the sum of the lengths of all chains.But this is equal to the number of elements in the set {x *d^k | x not divisible by d, x*d &lt;=n, k&gt;=0, x*d^k &lt;=n}.But how to compute this for a given d.Alternative approach for code generation:Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal d can be determined as follows:- For each possible d, compute the value (sum of the lengths of chains for d) - (number of chains).- Choose the d with the maximum value. If multiple, choose the largest d.But for large n, this is not feasible.But perhaps there&#39;s a way to compute this for d up to sqrt(n) and find the maximum.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that for d &gt;= sqrt(n), the maximum possible x is 1, because x*d &lt;=n → x &lt;=n/d &lt;=sqrt(n). For d &gt; sqrt(n), x must be 1. So for d&gt; sqrt(n), the chain is 1 →d →d^2 →... until &lt;=n. So the length of the chain is log_d(n) +1.For example, d=3 and n=10: 1→3→9 →27&gt;10. So chain length is 3. So edges 2.But this is only possible if d &lt;=n.But for d&gt; sqrt(n), the chain for x=1 is 1 →d. But if d&gt;n, then x*d is &gt;n, so the chain is just [1]. So no edges.So for d&gt; sqrt(n), the chain for x=1 is 1 →d. But if d&lt;=n, then the chain has length 2, edges 1.So for d&gt; sqrt(n), the sum edges is 1.But for d= sqrt(n), the chain for x=1 may be longer.So perhaps the optimal d is either 2 or the maximum possible d such that d &lt;=n and 1*d &lt;=n.But this is not sure.Alternatively, for large n, the optimal d is 2. For example, n=1e5. Using d=2, the number of chains and their lengths would be much larger than any other d.So perhaps the best approach is to choose d=2 for all n &gt;=2, except for cases where a larger d yields a higher sum.But how to verify this.But the sample input shows that for n=3, d=3 is chosen. But for d=2, the sum edges is 1, same as d=3.So when d=2 and d=3 give the same sum edges, the code can choose the larger d.Thus, perhaps the algorithm is:For each n:1. Find all possible d where the sum edges (sum of chain lengths - number of chains) is maximized.2. Among these d&#39;s, choose the largest one.3. Generate the permutation for this d.But how to compute this efficiently.Another idea: the maximum sum edges is achieved when the chains are as long as possible, which happens when d is as small as possible. Thus, d=2 is likely to be the optimal choice for large n.But for small n, like n=3, it&#39;s not.So perhaps for n &lt;=3, the optimal d is n. For larger n, the optimal d is 2.But how to verify.For n=4, d=2 gives sum edges 2. For d=4, sum edges 1. So d=2 is better.n=5: d=2 gives sum edges 2 (chain 1→2→4, chain 3→6&gt;5. sum edges 2).d=3 gives sum edges 1 (chain 1→3, 2→6&gt;5. sum edges 1).So d=2 is better.n=6: d=2 gives chains 1→2→4, 3→6, 5. sum edges 2+1=3.d=3 gives chains 1→3, 2→6. sum edges 1+1=2.So d=2 is better.n=7: d=2 gives 1→2→4→8&gt;7 (edges 2), 3→6 (edges 1), 5→10&gt;7 (edges 0), 7→14&gt;7 (edges 0). sum edges 3.d=3: chains 1→3→9&gt;7 (edges 1), 2→6 (edges 1), 5→15&gt;7 (edges 0), 7→21&gt;7 (edges 0). sum edges 2.So d=2 is better.So it seems that for n&gt;=4, d=2 is better. For n=3, d=3 is better.But how to generalize this.Perhaps for n &gt;=4, the optimal d is 2. For n=2, d=2. For n=3, d=3.But how to confirm.But what about n=6:d=2: sum edges 3 (chains of length 3 and 2, sum (3-1) + (2-1) =2+1=3).But what if there&#39;s a larger d with more edges.For example, d=3: sum edges 2.But d=4: chain is 1→4. sum edges 1.d=5: chain is 1→5. sum edges 1.d=6: chain is 1→6. sum edges 1.So no. So d=2 is best.Thus, the algorithm could be:if n ==2:   d=2.elif n ==3:   d=3.else:   d=2.But wait, what about n=5? For d=2, sum edges is 2. For d=5, sum edges is 1. So yes.But what about n=7, which we checked earlier.So the sample code would have to handle these cases.But how to implement this.But the sample for n=3 has d=3. But for d=2, it&#39;s possible to also have cost 1. So the sample&#39;s output is correct, but another output with d=2 and permutation [1,2,3] is also valid.But the problem says that if there are multiple answers, any is acceptable.So why does the sample choose d=3? Because the code might be choosing the largest possible d that maximizes the sum edges.So the algorithm would be:For each n:   find the d that maximizes the sum edges.   among those d&#39;s, choose the largest one.So, for n=3, d=3 and d=2 both give sum edges 1. So choose the largest d, 3.So the algorithm is correct.But how to compute this d efficiently.An alternative approach for code:We can note that the maximum sum edges is the maximum possible number of edges for any d. For each n, this maximum is floor(log_2 n) when d=2. But for small n, this may not be the case.But in the sample for n=3, the sum edges for d=2 and d=3 are both 1, but the largest d is chosen.So the code needs to find the largest d such that the sum edges is maximized.But how.An alternative idea is to find the maximum possible sum edges, and among all d that achieve this maximum, select the largest d.But how to compute this.But considering time constraints, perhaps the code can generate for each possible d up to sqrt(n), and also check d=2 and d=3, then find the best d.Alternatively, the code can try d=2 and d= the largest possible d (n), and choose whichever gives a higher sum edges.But this is not correct for all cases.Alternatively, for each n, the optimal d is the largest possible d for which the sum edges is maximum.But how to compute this.Another observation: For d=2, the sum edges is maximized for large n. For example, for n=1e5, d=2 allows a long chain starting with 1, then 2,4,8,16, etc. Sum edges is O(log n). For d=3, the chain starting with 1 is shorter, but there are more chains.But for large n, the sum edges for d=2 is much larger than any other d.Thus, for n &gt;=4, the optimal d is 2. For n=2, d=2. For n=3, d=3.So the code can handle these cases.But what about n=5:d=2:chains 1→2→4, 3→6&gt;5, 5→10&gt;5. sum edges 2.d=3:chains 1→3, 2→6&gt;5. sum edges 2.So sum edges is 2 for both d=2 and d=3. So the code would choose the larger d, which is 3.But according to the earlier analysis, for n=5, d=2 gives sum edges 2, and d=3 gives sum edges 2. So code should choose d=3.But in reality, the sum edges for d=3 is 2? Let&#39;s see:For d=3, the chains are:x=1 (not divisible by 3): chain is 1→3. edges 1.x=2 (not divisible by 3): 2*3=6&gt;5. So chain length 1. No edges.x=4: 4*3=12&gt;5. No.x=5: 5*3=15&gt;5. No.So sum edges is 1.Ah, I see. So my previous analysis was incorrect.So for d=3 and n=5:x=1→3, chain length 2: edges 1.x=2→6&gt;5: no chain.x=4→12&gt;5: no chain.x=5→15&gt;5: no chain.So sum edges is 1.But for d=2:x=1→2→4. edges 2.x=3→6&gt;5. no.x=5→10&gt;5. no.sum edges 2.So for n=5, d=2 gives higher sum edges. So the code would choose d=2.But according to earlier analysis, for d=3, sum edges is 1.So my previous thinking was wrong. So the code must choose d=2 for n=5.This suggests that the code should check for d=2 for all cases except when a higher d gives a better sum.But how to compute this.Alternatively, the code can always select d=2 for n&gt;=2, and generate the permutation. But the sample for n=3 shows that this is not the case.But in the sample for n=3, d=2 also gives sum edges 1. So the code can choose d=2 and the permutation [1,2,3], which would have the same cost as the sample&#39;s output.But the sample chooses d=3. So the code can choose any of the d&#39;s with maximum sum edges. The problem statement allows any.But the code needs to output a valid permutation and d. So for n=3, the code could output d=2 or d=3.But according to the sample, the code chooses d=3. So perhaps the code should select the largest possible d that maximizes the sum edges.But how to compute this.So perhaps the code can iterate d from 2 to n, and for each d, compute the sum edges. But for large n, this is not feasible.But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can precompute for each n the optimal d as follows:For each test case n:1. If n == 2: d=2.2. Else if n ==3: d=3.3. Else: d=2.But this is a heuristic based on small examples, but may not hold for all cases.Alternatively, for n &gt;=2, the optimal d is 2. For n=3, the code can choose d=2 or 3.But how to confirm.Alternatively, the code can generate the permutation for d=2 and see if it&#39;s correct.But for n=3, d=2:Chains are x=1 →2. x=3: 3*2=6&gt;3. So sum edges 1.So permutation would be [1,2,3], cost 1. Or [3,1,2], cost 1.So any of these is valid.The sample chooses d=3 and permutation [2,1,3], cost 1.So the code can choose either.So perhaps the code can always choose d=2 for n&gt;=2, and arrange the permutation accordingly.But then why does the sample for n=3 choose d=3?Ah, perhaps the sample&#39;s answer is one of many possible correct answers. So the code can choose any d that maximizes the sum edges.But the code needs to choose one. So perhaps the code can always choose d=2 for n &gt;=2.But for n=3, this would also be correct.But the sample&#39;s code for n=3 uses d=3. So there&#39;s a discrepancy.But according to the problem statement, any correct answer is acceptable.Thus, the code can choose d=2 for all cases, and generate the permutation accordingly.But let&#39;s see:For n=3, d=2:Chains:1 →2.3 →6&gt;3.So permutation is [1,2,3]. cost 1.Which is correct.So the sample&#39;s output is another valid solution.So the code can choose to generate the permutation with d=2 for all cases.But why does the sample choose d=3 for n=3?Perhaps because the code&#39;s logic is to choose the largest possible d where the sum edges is maximized.But for n=3, d=2 and d=3 both give sum edges of 1. So the code chooses the larger d.So the code should, for each n, find all possible d that maximize the sum edges, then choose the largest such d.But how to compute this.Given the time constraints for code submission, perhaps the code can find for each n the largest d where there exists at least one x such that x*d &lt;=n. And among those d&#39;s, choose the largest one.But this is not correct, but perhaps the code can pass the test cases.Alternatively, the code can generate the permutation for d=2, which is correct for all cases except n=3. But for n=3, it&#39;s also correct.Thus, the code can proceed as follows:For each test case:   if n == 2:       d =2.       permutation is [1, 2].   else:       d=2.       generate the permutation by creating chains for d=2, then the remaining elements.But for n=3, this would produce [1,2,3], which is valid.But why does the sample for n=3 output d=3?Because there are multiple valid answers, and the sample&#39;s code chooses a different approach.But the code can proceed with d=2 for all cases.But how to construct the permutation for d=2.The code can generate all chains for d=2, then append the remaining elements.For example, for n=5:Chains:1 →2 →4.3 →6&gt;5.5 →10&gt;5.So chains are [1,2,4], [3], [5].Wait, no. Because for x=3, d=2, x*d=6&gt;5. So x=3 is not part of a chain. So the chains are only [1,2,4]. The remaining elements are 3,5.So the permutation is [1,2,4,3,5].This gives edges 2 (1→2 and 2→4).So cost 2.Which is the maximum possible.Thus, the code can generate the permutation by arranging the chains in order, followed by the remaining elements.Thus, the code can be structured as follows:For a given d=2:   generate all chains.   chains are sorted in increasing order of starting elements.   remaining elements are sorted in increasing order.   permutation is the concatenation of all chains, followed by remaining elements.But wait, the remaining elements must not form any pairs x →x*d.So the remaining elements can be arranged in any order, but not forming any edges.So for example, for n=5 and d=2:remaining elements are 3,5.3*2=6&gt;5.5*2=10&gt;5.So no edges.So the permutation [1,2,4,3,5] is valid.Thus, the code can generate the permutation as follows:- For each x from 1 to n, in order:   if x is not in any chain and x is not divisible by 2 and x*2 &lt;=n:       create a chain.- The remaining elements are added in increasing order.But the code can arrange the chains in any order, but to make it deterministic, they can be ordered in increasing order of their starting elements.But how to implement this.Let&#39;s think of the algorithm:Initialize a list to store the permutation.Create a used array to track which numbers are already included.For x from 1 to n:   if x is not used, and x is not divisible by 2, and x*2 &lt;=n:       current = x       while current &lt;=n:           add current to the permutation.           mark current as used.           current *=2Add all remaining unused numbers in sorted order.So for n=3:x=1 is not used, not divisible by 2, and 1*2=2 &lt;=3.So chain is 1 →2.remaining numbers is 3.permutation is [1,2,3].This gives cost 1.Which is correct.For n=3, the sample&#39;s code outputs d=3 and permutation [2,1,3], which also has cost 1.So both are correct.Thus, the code can proceed with d=2 for all cases, and generate the permutation as described.But according to the problem&#39;s sample input, the code can choose to output d=2 for n=3.But why does the sample choose d=3? Because there&#39;s another valid solution.Thus, the code can choose any of the valid d&#39;s. The problem allows this.But the code must output a valid permutation and d. So the code can choose d=2 for all cases.But the sample&#39;s code for n=3 uses d=3. So the code must generate permutations for different d&#39;s.But according to the problem&#39;s note, any valid answer is accepted.So the code can proceed with d=2 for all cases, and generate the permutation as described.But how to handle cases where d=2 is not the optimal.For example, for n=3, d=3 and d=2 give the same sum edges. So choosing the largest d (3) is allowed.Thus, the code should generate d=3 for n=3, and d=2 for other cases.But how to implement this.Thus, the code can:For each test case:   if n ==3:       output d=3 and permutation [2,1,3].   else:       use d=2 and generate the permutation.But this is a hack, but may pass the sample.But what about other cases.For example, n=5:As discussed earlier, the code with d=2 gives cost 2.But what if there&#39;s a d that gives higher sum edges.But according to earlier analysis, for n=5, d=2 gives sum edges 2, which is higher than any other d.Thus, the code is correct.Thus, the code can be written as follows:For each test case:   if n ==3:       print d=3 and permutation [2,1,3]   else:       generate the permutation with d=2.But this is not a general solution. For example, if there&#39;s a test case where n=5 and d=3 gives sum edges higher than d=2, this code would fail.But according to previous analysis, this is not the case.Thus, the code can proceed with this approach, but it&#39;s not scalable.But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can proceed with the following approach:Generate the permutation for d=2, and for n=3, output the sample&#39;s solution.But this is not general.Alternatively, the code can generate the permutation for d=2 for all cases, and this would be correct.Because for n=3, the permutation [1,2,3] with d=2 has cost 1, which is correct.But the sample&#39;s solution also has cost 1, but with d=3.Thus, the code can proceed with generating the permutation for d=2 for all cases.But how to implement this.The code:Read t test cases.For each test case:   n = input.   if n == 2:       print(2)       print(1 2)   else:       print(2)       generate permutation.But how to generate the permutation.The code can generate the permutation as follows:used = [False] * (n+1)perm = []for x in range(1, n+1):   if not used[x] and x %2 !=0 and x*2 &lt;=n:       current = x       while current &lt;=n:           perm.append(current)           used[current] = True           current *=2# add the remaining elements in increasing order.remaining = []for x in range(1, n+1):   if not used[x]:       remaining.append(x)# append remaining to perm.perm += remainingprint(&#39; &#39;.join(map(str, perm)))For n=3:x=1 is not used, not divisible by 2, 1*2=2 &lt;=3.Chain is 1 →2.Then, remaining elements are 3.Perm is [1,2,3].Cost is 1.Which is correct.For n=3, the code&#39;s output would be d=2 and permutation [1,2,3], which is valid.But the sample&#39;s output is different.But according to the problem&#39;s statement, any valid output is acceptable.Thus, the code would be correct.Thus, this approach should work for all cases.Let me test it for other cases.Test case n=4:Perm generation:x=1: not used, odd, 2&lt;=4.Chain 1 →2 →4.x=3: not used, odd, 3*2=6&gt;4.So remaining elements are 3.Perm is [1,2,4,3].Cost 2 (1→2, 2→4).Which is correct.Test case n=5:x=1 →2 →4.x=3 →6&gt;5.x=5 →10&gt;5.Perm is [1,2,4,3,5].Cost 2.Which is correct.Test case n=6:x=1 →2 →4.x=3 →6.x=5 →10&gt;6.Perm is [1,2,4,3,6,5].Cost 3 (1→2,2→4,3→6).Which is correct.Thus, this code would generate the correct permutation for d=2, which gives the maximum possible edges.Thus, the code can be written as follows:Read t.For each test case:   n = int(input())   if n == 2:       print(2)       print(1 2)   else:       print(2)       used = [False]*(n+1)       perm = []       for x in range(1, n+1):           if not used[x] and x %2 ==1 and x*2 &lt;=n:               current = x               while current &lt;=n:                   perm.append(current)                   used[current] = True                   current *=2       remaining = []       for x in range(1, n+1):           if not used[x]:               remaining.append(x)       perm += remaining       print(&#39; &#39;.join(map(str, perm)))But wait, in the code, x must be odd and x*2 &lt;=n. So for x even, they are not considered as starting points for chains.But the code uses x starting from 1, which is odd, then multiplies by 2.Thus, the code generates all chains for d=2.But why is this correct.Because for d=2, the starting x must be odd (not divisible by 2), and x*2 &lt;=n.Thus, the code correctly generates all chains for d=2.Thus, the code should be correct for all cases.But the sample input for n=3 would output d=2 and permutation [1,2,3], which is correct.The sample&#39;s output for n=3 is different but also correct.Thus, the code meets the problem&#39;s requirements.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to find a permutation of length ( n ) and a value ( d ) such that the cost of the permutation is maximized. The cost is defined as the number of indices ( i ) where ( p_i cdot d = p_{i+1} ). Approach1. Optimal Value of ( d ):   - Through analysis, we observed that choosing ( d = 2 ) generally provides a good balance between the number of valid pairs and the length of chains formed by these pairs. This is because smaller values of ( d ) allow for longer chains of consecutive elements, which maximizes the cost.2. Constructing the Permutation:   - For ( d = 2 ), generate chains starting from each odd number ( x ) such that ( x cdot 2 leq n ). Each chain is formed by repeatedly multiplying by 2 until the result exceeds ( n ).   - After generating all possible chains for ( d = 2 ), append the remaining elements in sorted order to ensure no unintended pairs are formed. Solution Code```pythonimport sysdef main():    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())    for _ in range(t):        n = int(sys.stdin.readline())        if n == 2:            print(2)            print(&quot;1 2&quot;)            continue        used = [False] * (n + 1)        perm = []        for x in range(1, n + 1):            if not used[x] and x % 2 == 1 and x * 2 &lt;= n:                current = x                while current &lt;= n:                    perm.append(current)                    used[current] = True                    current *= 2        # Collect remaining elements        remaining = []        for x in range(1, n + 1):            if not used[x]:                remaining.append(x)        perm += remaining        print(2)        print(&#39; &#39;.join(map(str, perm)))if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation1. Reading Input: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, we read the value of ( n ).2. Special Case for ( n = 2 ): Directly handle the smallest case where the permutation is `[1, 2]` with ( d = 2 ).3. Generating Chains: For each odd number ( x ), generate a chain by repeatedly multiplying by 2 until the result exceeds ( n ). This ensures we form the longest possible valid chains.4. Appending Remaining Elements: After processing all possible chains, append any remaining elements in sorted order to avoid forming unintended pairs.This approach ensures that we maximize the cost by leveraging the structure of chains formed by multiplying by 2, which is efficient and works well for large values of ( n ).</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-30f0ed69 data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review" data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review-title" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>❓:</span>A speedrun is a playthrough of a game with the intention to complete it as quickly as possible. When speedrunning, you usually follow a pre-planned path through the game. Along this path, there may be some places where you have to pull off a difficult technique, or trick, which may cause a delay if you fail to pull it off successfully. Luckily you can reset the game at any time: if you have made a few mistakes, you can start a new run, losing your progress but instantaneously starting over with a clean slate. You can do this as often as you like.The game you are currently speedrunning has a record of r seconds, which you intend to beat. You have discovered a path through the game that, in the best case, takes n &lt; r seconds. There are some tricks along the way, though: you know exactly where along the run they occur, what the probability is that you will pull them off successfully, and how many seconds you have to spend to recover if they fail.Given this data, you want to find the optimal strategy for when to reset the game to minimise the expected time to set a new record. Write a program to determine what this smallest possible expected time is.-----Input-----The input consists of: - One line with three integers n, r and m (2 leq n &lt; r leq 5000, 1 le m le 50), where n and r are as described above and m is the number of tricks. - m lines, each containing three numbers describing a trick: - An integer t (1 le t &lt; n), the time in the route (assuming no failed tricks before) at which the trick occurs, - a real number p (0 &lt; p &lt; 1 and p has at most 6 digits after the decimal point), the probability that the trick succeeds, and - an integer d (1 le d le 1000), the number of seconds required to recover in case the trick fails.The tricks are given in sorted order by t, and no two tricks occur at the same time t in the route.You may assume that, without resetting, a single playthrough has a probability of at least 1 in 50000 to succeed at improving the record.-----Output-----Output the expected time you will have to play the game to set a new record, assuming an optimal strategy is used. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most 10^{-6}.Explanation of Sample Input 1The record for this game is 111 seconds, and your route takes 100 seconds if everything goes right.After playing for 20 seconds, there is a trick with a 50%  success rate. If it succeeds, you keep playing. If it fails, you incur a 10 second time loss: now the run will take at least 110 seconds. It is still possible to set a record, but every other trick in the run has to be successful. It turns out to be faster on average to reset after failing the first trick.Thus you repeat the first 20 seconds of the game until the trick is successful: with probability 1/2, it takes 1 attempt; with probability 1/4, it takes 2 attempts; and so on. On average, you spend 40 seconds on the first 20 seconds of the route.Once you have successfully performed the first trick, you want to finish the run no matter the result of the other tricks: it takes 80 seconds, plus on average 1 second loss from each of the remaining 4 tricks. So the expected time until you set a record is 124 seconds.-----Examples-----Sample Input 1:100 111 520 0.5 1080 0.5 285 0.5 290 0.5 295 0.5 2Sample Output 1:124Sample Input 2:2 4 11 0.5 5Sample Output 2:3Sample Input 3:10 20 35 0.3 86 0.8 38 0.9 3Sample Output 3:18.9029850746</div><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>🧠:</span>Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let&#39;s read through the problem statement carefully.So, the problem is about finding the optimal strategy for speedrunning a game to minimize the expected time to beat the current record. The key here is that the player can reset at any time, which might be better than continuing after a failure if the expected time of resetting is lower than continuing.The input gives n, r, and m. n is the best case time of the route, which is less than r (the current record). Then there are m tricks. Each trick happens at time t (assuming no previous failures), has a success probability p, and a recovery time d if failed.The main idea is that each trick introduces a possible point where a failure can add time. But when a failure occurs, the player can choose to reset immediately (start over) or continue and see if the remaining time plus the added delays still allows beating the record.Our goal is to model the expected time for each possible state (like after certain successes and possible failures) and find the optimal decision (reset or continue) that leads to the minimal expected time.Hmm. So this sounds like a dynamic programming problem. We need to model the possible states and calculate the expected time for each, considering the optimal decision at each point.First, let&#39;s think about the possible states. Each state can be characterized by the current time (including any delays from previous failures) and the position in the trick sequence. Wait, but the tricks are sorted by time. So maybe the state can be represented as the index of the next trick to attempt, along with the current total time so far (including any delays). But the current time must not exceed r, otherwise even if all subsequent tricks succeed, the total time would exceed the record and thus be invalid.Wait, but when a trick is failed, adding d to the total time. So, after each trick, we have to track the accumulated delays. However, the problem states that if the accumulated time plus the best case remaining time (i.e., the time from the current point to the end, assuming all future tricks succeed) plus delays exceeds r, then it&#39;s impossible to beat the record, so the player must reset.Wait, but how do we model this? Let&#39;s think recursively. For each trick, we have two possibilities: success or failure. The decision after a failure is whether to reset or continue.So, perhaps the approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each trick i (after successfully handling up to that point), and the accumulated delay time so far, compute the minimal expected time from that point onwards.But how do we track the accumulated delays? Because each trick can add a delay if failed. The total time of the run is n (the best case) plus the sum of all delays incurred from failed tricks. So, if the accumulated sum plus the best case time (n) exceeds r, then even if all future tricks are successful, the total time would be n + sum_delays &gt;= r (since n + sum_delays &gt;= r?), which is not possible. So the player must reset.Wait, no. The best case time is n. Each trick&#39;s time t is part of the original route. If a trick is failed, it adds d to the total time. So the actual time taken is the original route&#39;s time (n) plus the sum of all d&#39;s from failed tricks. So the total time is n + sum of d&#39;s where the trick failed.But the player can reset at any time, which means that after a failure, the player can choose to reset, which would take time up to that point (t + accumulated delays so far) plus the time for the reset (but resetting allows starting over, so the time is the time spent up to the reset, but the new run starts from zero).Wait, no. Resetting after a failure at some point means that the time spent in the current run is added to the total, but the new run starts fresh. Wait, no. Resetting abandons the current run and starts over. So the time spent in the failed run is counted, but then the player starts again. So the total expected time is the time spent in the failed run plus the expected time of starting over.Wait, but how is the time accounted for when resetting. For example, suppose the player is at time T in the current run, and decides to reset. Then the time T is added to the total, and they start a new run. So the expected time is T + E, where E is the expected time from the start. So, the decision to reset would compare the expected time of continuing (E_cont) versus resetting (T + E_start).So for each state, we need to compute the minimal expected time between continuing or resetting.So the key is to model for each possible position in the trick sequence (i.e., after succeeding up to some trick), and the accumulated delays, what is the minimal expected time to reach the end (beating the record).But how do we model the accumulated delays? Because each trick&#39;s failure adds d to the total time. So the total time of the run is n + sum of d&#39;s from failed tricks. This must be less than r.Wait, but if during the run, after some failures, the accumulated delays plus the best case time (n) already exceed r, then even if all future tricks succeed, the total time would be n + sum_delays &gt;= r, which would not beat the record. So in that case, the player must reset.So for each possible state (current position in the tricks, accumulated delays), the player can compute whether continuing is possible. If not, resetting is the only option.So the steps would be:1. Process the tricks in order. For each trick i, we track the possible accumulated delays up to that point. If after failing this trick, the sum of delays plus the best case time (n) would exceed r, then even if all remaining tricks are successful, the total time would be too long, so the player must reset.Otherwise, the player can choose to reset or continue after the failure.So for each trick i, and accumulated delay sum_d, we can model the expected time.But the problem is that the accumulated sum_d can be up to (r - n) since any sum_d &gt;= (r - n) would make n + sum_d &gt;= r, which is invalid.Wait, sum_d can&#39;t be more than (r - n - 1), because if sum_d &gt;= (r -n), then even if all future tricks succeed, the total time would be n + sum_d &gt;= r, which can&#39;t beat the record. So for such cases, the player must reset.Therefore, for each state (i, sum_d), where i is the next trick to attempt, and sum_d is the accumulated delays so far, the maximum sum_d is (r - n - 1). But given that n can be up to 4999 and r up to 5000, sum_d can be up to (5000 - 4999 -1) = 0? Wait, wait n is less than r. So r can be n+1. For example, n=2, r=4. Then sum_d must be &lt;= r -n -1 =4-2-1=1. So sum_d can be 0 or 1. So in this case, if sum_d is 1, the best case time is n (2) + sum_d (1) =3 &lt;4, which is okay. But if sum_d is 2, 2+2=4 which is not less than r, so the run would be invalid.Wait, the problem statement says that the run is successful if it&#39;s completed in less than r seconds. So the sum of delays must be such that n + sum_delays &lt; r.Therefore, sum_d can be up to (r - n -1). So the possible sum_d values are 0, 1, ..., (r -n -1). That&#39;s a manageable number for dynamic programming.So the DP state can be represented by (i, sum_d), where i is the index of the next trick to process (0-based or 1-based?), and sum_d is the accumulated delays so far. The DP[i][sum_d] represents the minimal expected time from that state onwards to complete the run.The transitions would be:For each trick i, sum_d:- The trick is at time t_i. The time taken up to this trick is t_i (original time) plus sum_d (delays so far). So, when we reach this trick, the current time in the run is t_i + sum_d.But wait, the t_i is the time in the route assuming no previous failures. So the actual time in the run when reaching this trick is t_i plus the sum of delays from previous failed tricks. Because each failed trick adds d to the delay, which affects the total time.Wait, for example, if a trick occurs at t=20, and there were previous failures adding 10 seconds, then the actual time when arriving at this trick is 20 + 10 =30 seconds. But the trick&#39;s t is 20, which is part of the original route. So the actual time in the run is the sum of the original t&#39;s up to that point (t_i) plus the sum_d (sum of d&#39;s from previous failures). Because each previous failure adds d to the total time.So, when processing trick i, the current time in the run is t_i + sum_d. Then, attempting the trick:- Success (probability p_i): the sum_d remains the same. The next trick is i+1, and the current time increases by the time taken to process the next trick. Wait, no. The next trick&#39;s original time is t_{i+1}. So the time between t_i and t_{i+1} is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds, assuming no failures in between. But if the current trick is successful, the player proceeds to the next trick, which is at t_{i+1} in the original route. However, the actual time to reach the next trick would be (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds added to the current time (t_i + sum_d) plus the time taken to do the current trick&#39;s success.Wait, maybe I&#39;m overcomplicating. The key point is that when you proceed past a trick, the time up to the next trick is determined by the original route. So between trick i and trick i+1, the time taken is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. But when you attempt trick i, if you succeed, you proceed to the next part of the route, which takes (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds, and then reach trick i+1. If you fail, you incur a delay of d_i, adding to sum_d, and then proceed to the next trick, but the time in the run is now t_i + sum_d + d_i (sum_d increases by d_i) plus the (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think:Suppose you are at trick i, which occurs at time t_i in the original route, and sum_d is the accumulated delays so far. The current time in the run is t_i + sum_d. When attempting the trick:- Success (prob p_i): you proceed to the next part of the route, which takes (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds (original route time between tricks i and i+1) and reach trick i+1 at time t_{i+1} + sum_d. So sum_d remains the same. The time taken between this trick and the next is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds, which adds to the total.- Failure (prob 1-p_i): you incur a delay of d_i, so sum_d becomes sum_d + d_i. Then, the time in the run is t_i + sum_d (original) + d_i (added) = t_i + (sum_d + d_i). Then, the player can choose to reset or continue. Wait, no: after failing the trick, the delay is added, and the run continues. The time taken after the failure is the time to the next step. So, the time between trick i and the next step (trick i+1) is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the total time up to trick i+1 would be (t_i + sum_d) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) = t_{i+1} + sum_d (if successful). If failed, sum_d increases by d_i, and then the next step&#39;s time is (t_{i+1} - t_i) added to (t_i + sum_d + d_i) + ... ?Alternatively, perhaps the accumulated delays are the sum of all d_i&#39;s from failed tricks. So, for each trick, if failed, sum_d increases by d_i, and the time proceeds. But when you reach the end of all tricks, the total time is n + sum_d, which must be less than r.So the main idea is that after each trick, the sum_d can be tracked, and whenever sum_d exceeds (r - n -1), the run is invalid and must be reset.So the dynamic programming approach would model for each trick i and sum_d, the minimal expected time to complete from that state.Now, let&#39;s think about the DP transitions.The base case is when all tricks are processed (i = m). Then, the sum_d must be such that n + sum_d &lt; r. So if sum_d &lt;= r - n -1, then the total time is sum_d + n. However, since the player would have to run the entire route (including the time taken to pass all tricks), but wait, the sum_d is the total delay from failed tricks, and the original route&#39;s time is n. So the total time is n + sum_d. But for the base case, if sum_d is such that n + sum_d &lt; r, then the run is successful, and the time taken is the sum of all the time in the run (including the delays), which is the original n plus sum_d. But wait, the original n is the time for the best case. But the actual time would be the sum of all the time in the run, which includes the original route&#39;s time plus the sum of delays. For example, the original route is 100 seconds. Each failed trick adds d to the sum_d. So the total time is 100 + sum_d. So yes, the base case is when i == m (all tricks processed), then the total time is n + sum_d. But this must be less than r. If sum_d is such that n + sum_d &gt;= r, then the run is invalid, so the player must reset.Wait, but how do we handle this in the DP? For the base case (i = m), if sum_d is &lt;= (r - n - 1), then the time is n + sum_d. Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible, and the player must reset. So the expected time for the state (i=m, sum_d) is n + sum_d if sum_d &lt;= (r - n -1), else infinity (since it&#39;s impossible, so reset).But how do we model the resetting?Let me think. For a state (i, sum_d), we can compute the minimal expected time. The possible actions are:After a failure at trick i, the player can choose to reset or continue.But how does the failure affect the sum_d? Let&#39;s model each trick i.When we are at trick i, sum_d is the accumulated delays so far.The time taken to reach this trick is t_i + sum_d.Then, attempting the trick:Case 1: Success (prob p_i)The player proceeds to the next trick (i+1), with sum_d remaining the same.The time taken between this trick and the next is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the total time added is (t_{i+1} - t_i), and the next state is (i+1, sum_d). The expected time from this state is (t_{i+1} - t_i) + DP[i+1][sum_d].Case 2: Failure (prob 1-p_i)sum_d increases by d_i. Now, the player can choose to reset or continue.Option 1: Continue. Then, the sum_d becomes sum_d + d_i.But we need to check if sum_d + d_i exceeds (r -n -1). If so, even if all remaining tricks are successful, the total time would be n + sum_d + d_i &gt;= r. Thus, the run is invalid, and the player must reset. Otherwise, the player proceeds to the next trick (i+1) with sum_d_new = sum_d + d_i, and the time taken between the current trick and the next is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the total time added is (t_{i+1} - t_i) + the expected time from (i+1, sum_d_new).Option 2: Reset. The time spent in the current run is the time up to this point (t_i + sum_d) plus the time taken to fail the trick. Wait, after failing the trick, what is the time taken for that failure? Wait, when you attempt the trick and fail, you have to spend the recovery time d_i. Wait, no. The problem statement says: &quot;if a trick fails, you incur a delay of d seconds.&quot; So the d is added to the total time. But when you reset, you abandon the current run. So the time spent in the current run up to the reset is the time taken to reach the trick (t_i + sum_d) plus the time between the previous tricks and the current one. Wait, perhaps I&#39;m misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the problem statement.The problem statement says:&quot;the time in the route (assuming no failed tricks before) at which the trick occurs.&quot;So each trick occurs at time t in the original route, which is the time since the start of the run, assuming no previous failures.But when a trick is failed, the time loss d is added to the total time. So the actual time of the run up to that point is t_i + sum_d (sum_d is the sum of d&#39;s from previous failures) plus d_i (the current failure&#39;s d) if the current trick is failed.Wait, no. The sum_d represents the accumulated delays before attempting this trick. So when you attempt trick i, you are at time t_i + sum_d. If you fail, the sum_d increases by d_i, making the new sum_d&#39; = sum_d + d_i. Then, the time to proceed to the next part is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. But since sum_d&#39; is sum_d + d_i, the next trick&#39;s time in the original route is t_{i+1}, but the actual time in the run would be t_{i+1} + sum_d&#39;.So, the time taken between trick i and the next is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds, which is part of the original route, but the sum_d&#39; affects the actual time.So, after failing trick i, the sum_d becomes sum_d + d_i. Then, the player can choose to continue or reset.If they choose to continue:- The next step is to proceed to the next trick (i+1), and the time taken for that step is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. The expected time is (t_{i+1} - t_i) + DP[i+1][sum_d + d_i], but only if sum_d + d_i &lt;= (r - n -1). Otherwise, the run is invalid, and the player must reset.If they choose to reset:- The time spent in this run is the time up to and including the current trick&#39;s failure. So the time is t_i + sum_d (time to reach the trick) plus the time taken to process the failure (but how much time is that?).Wait, the time taken to process the trick&#39;s failure: when you attempt the trick and fail, the time loss is d_i. So the time spent up to the failure is t_i + sum_d (time to reach the trick) + (processing time for the failure). But according to the problem statement, the d is the number of seconds required to recover. So does the d_i represent the time added to the run if you fail the trick?Yes. So when you fail a trick, the run&#39;s total time increases by d_i. So after failing, the sum_d increases by d_i, which is added to the total time.So, when you fail a trick, the sum_d becomes sum_d + d_i. So the time in the run is the original time (t_i) plus sum_d (previous delays) plus d_i (current delay). So the actual time up to this point is t_i + sum_d + d_i. But then, the player proceeds to the next steps. However, if the player chooses to reset, they have to spend the time up to that point (t_i + sum_d + d_i) and then start over. So the expected time would be (t_i + sum_d + d_i) + E_start, where E_start is the expected time from the beginning (state 0, sum_d=0).But this is only if the player decides to reset after failing.Alternatively, if the player decides to continue, then the sum_d becomes sum_d + d_i, and they proceed to the next trick. But if sum_d + d_i exceeds (r -n -1), then even if all remaining tricks are successful, the total time would be n + sum_d + d_i &gt;= r, so the run is invalid. Hence, the player must reset.So for the DP transitions:At state (i, sum_d), the expected time is the minimum between:a) The expected time if we attempt the trick and either succeed or fail, then make optimal choices.ORb) The expected time if we reset immediately (without attempting the trick). But why would that be better? Because maybe the current sum_d is already too high, but that&#39;s handled in the state transitions.Wait, the player can choose to reset at any time, but resetting would mean abandoning the current run and adding the time spent so far to the total.But in the problem statement, the player can reset at any time. So, during a run, the player can choose to reset before attempting any trick. For example, before attempting a trick, the player may decide to reset (e.g., because the expected time of continuing is higher than resetting).Wait, but this complicates the DP, as the state would have to account for the time spent so far in the current run. Because when you reset, you add the time spent in the current run to the total time, and then start over.But in the current model, the sum_d is the accumulated delays from failed tricks. So the time spent so far is t_i (original time) + sum_d (delays) plus the time taken to reach this point. Wait, no: the time to reach trick i is the original time t_i plus sum_d (the delays from previous failures). So the total time spent in the current run up to this point is t_i + sum_d. If the player resets now, they add that time to their total and start over.But how is the time accounted for when you reset. For example, suppose you are at trick i, sum_d, and you decide to reset. The time spent is t_i + sum_d. Then, the expected total time is (t_i + sum_d) + E_start, where E_start is the expected time from the start.So, the decision to reset can be made at any point, not just after a failure. So the DP should consider the option of resetting at any state (i, sum_d), comparing the expected time of proceeding (attempting the next steps) versus resetting (current time + E_start).So for each state (i, sum_d), the expected time is the minimum between:1. The expected time of attempting the current trick and proceeding optimally, plus the time taken to reach that trick (t_i + sum_d).Wait, no. Wait, the DP[i][sum_d] represents the expected time from this state onwards. So the transitions are:The player is at trick i, sum_d. The time to reach this point is t_i + sum_d (but perhaps this is part of the accumulated time already considered in previous steps).Wait, perhaps the DP[i][sum_d] is the expected time starting from the moment the player is about to attempt trick i, with sum_d delays. So the time up to this point has already been accounted for.Hmm, maybe we need to model the DP[i][sum_d] as the expected time from the start of the run, given that the player is at trick i with sum_d delays. Or perhaps, the DP[i][sum_d] is the expected time from the current state (after having already spent some time) to the completion, plus the time spent so far.This is getting a bit confusing. Let&#39;s think differently.The total expected time is the sum of all time spent in each run (including resets) until a successful run is completed.Each time a reset occurs, the time spent in the current run is added to the total, and the player starts a new run.So, for example, if the player decides to reset after a certain point, the time spent in that run is added to the total, and they start over. So the expected time is (time in current run) + (expected time of starting over).The challenge is to model the optimal decision at each possible state (i, sum_d) to either continue the run or reset and try again.So, for each state (i, sum_d), the minimal expected time E[i][sum_d] is the minimum between:a) The expected time of proceeding with the current run, starting from trick i, sum_d.ORb) The expected time of resetting now (which is (current run time) + E[0][0], where E[0][0] is the expected time from the start).But how do we compute the current run time for state (i, sum_d)?Wait, the time spent so far in the current run is the time up to trick i plus the sum_d. So, when in state (i, sum_d), the time spent in the current run is t_i + sum_d. If the player chooses to reset, then the total time contributed is t_i + sum_d, and they start over, leading to E[0][0] expected time. So the expected time for resetting would be (t_i + sum_d) + E[0][0].So for each state (i, sum_d), the expected time E[i][sum_d] is the minimum between:1. Proceeding with the current run (compute the expected time of handling the next steps) plus the time spent so far (t_i + sum_d).Wait, no. Because E[i][sum_d] should already account for the time from this state onwards. So maybe the way to model this is that E[i][sum_d] is the expected time from the moment the player is in state (i, sum_d) (i.e., after having spent t_i + sum_d time in the current run) to the completion of a successful run.So, when in state (i, sum_d), the player can choose to reset, which would take (t_i + sum_d) time (current run&#39;s time) and then start over with expected time E[0][0]. So the total expected time in this case is (t_i + sum_d) + E[0][0].Alternatively, the player can proceed to attempt the current trick and any subsequent ones, which would involve:- Attempting trick i. The time taken to attempt the trick is zero? Or is the time between tricks part of the route&#39;s time?Ah, this is a crucial point. The original route&#39;s time is n seconds. The tricks occur at specific times t in the route, assuming no previous failures. So between the tricks, the time is the original route&#39;s time. For example, between trick i and i+1, the original route takes (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So when you proceed from trick i to i+1, the time between them is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds, which is part of the original route&#39;s time and must be accounted for.So, in the DP model, the time taken to reach the next trick is part of the total time. So, when moving from trick i to i+1, the time added is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So in the DP transitions, these times must be added.So, let&#39;s formalize this:The player is in state (i, sum_d). The current time in the run is t_i + sum_d. Now, they have to attempt trick i.If they proceed, they will spend some time processing the trick and moving to the next one.After attempting trick i, there are two possibilities:1. Success (prob p_i):   They proceed to the next trick (i+1). The time taken between trick i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the total time added for this step is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. The sum_d remains the same. So the new state is (i+1, sum_d). The expected time from this state is E[i+1][sum_d], plus the time taken (t_{i+1} - t_i).2. Failure (prob 1 - p_i):   The sum_d increases by d_i. Now, the player can choose to continue or reset.   If they choose to continue:      a. Check if sum_d + d_i &gt; (r - n -1). If so, even if all remaining tricks are successful, the total time will be n + sum_d + d_i &gt;= r, so the run is invalid. Therefore, the player must reset, leading to time (t_i + sum_d + d_i) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) ) + ... wait, perhaps not. Because after failing the trick, the sum_d becomes sum_d + d_i, but even if that sum is over the threshold, the player must reset. So, if sum_d + d_i exceeds (r -n -1), the run is impossible, and the player must reset. So, the expected time for this scenario is (time spent up to this point) + time for resetting.      So in this case, the time spent in the current run up to this failure is t_i + sum_d. The time to process the failure is d_i (the delay added). So the total time spent in this run is (t_i + sum_d + d_i) plus the time between trick i and i+1, which is (t_{i+1} - t_i). But wait, no. The delay d_i is added to the sum_d, making the sum_d_new = sum_d + d_i. Then, the time between trick i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the time up to the next trick is sum_d_new + t_{i+1}.      Wait, perhaps after failing trick i, the sum_d becomes sum_d + d_i. The player then has to proceed to the next trick i+1. The time between i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the time taken in the run up to the next trick is sum_d_new + t_{i+1} = (sum_d + d_i) + t_{i+1}.      But the original route&#39;s time up to i+1 is t_{i+1} seconds. So, the time added due to delays is sum_d + d_i. So the total time up to the next trick is t_{i+1} + sum_d + d_i.      So, after failing, the player can choose to reset or continue.      If they continue, then they move to trick i+1 with sum_d_new = sum_d + d_i, and the time between i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the expected time for this path is (t_{i+1} - t_i) (time between tricks) plus E[i+1][sum_d_new], but only if sum_d_new &lt;= (r -n -1). Otherwise, the run is impossible, and they must reset.      If they reset, the time spent in this run is (t_i + sum_d) (time to reach trick i) + d_i (delay from failure) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) (time between tricks) = t_i + sum_d + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) = sum_d + d_i + t_{i+1}.      So resetting would add this time to the total, and the player starts over with expected time E[0][0].   So, the expected time for the failure case is:   min( (time to continue) , (time to reset) )But this is getting quite complex. How to model all this in the DP transitions?Let&#39;s formalize the transitions:For each state (i, sum_d), the expected time E[i][sum_d] is the minimum between:Option 1: Reset now. Time is (t_i + sum_d) + E[0][0].Option 2: Attempt the current trick, then proceed optimally.The expected time for option 2 is:p_i * [ (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[i+1][sum_d] ] + (1 - p_i) * [ min(    (time to continue after failure),    (time to reset after failure) ) ]Where:Time to continue after failure is: if sum_d + d_i &gt; r -n -1, then reset is forced. The time for this is (t_i + sum_d + d_i) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0} ?Wait, no. If sum_d + d_i exceeds the threshold, then the player must reset. So after failing and adding d_i to sum_d, the sum_d_new is sum_d +d_i. Then, the player must reset, which adds the time up to this point (t_i + sum_d) + d_i (delay) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) (time between tricks) = sum_d +d_i + t_{i+1} + ...? Wait, no. Because after failing trick i, the sum_d_new is sum_d + d_i. Then, the player has to proceed to the next step (which is trick i+1). But if sum_d_new is over the threshold, the run is invalid. So the player must reset, which means adding the time spent up to the current point (which is t_i + sum_d) plus the d_i (the delay from failing the trick), plus the time between i and i+1 (t_{i+1} - t_i). But that&#39;s part of the run&#39;s time even after the failure.Wait, perhaps after failing a trick, the player has to spend d_i seconds to recover. But how is this accounted for in the total time?The problem statement says that d is the number of seconds required to recover if they fail. So when a trick is failed, the player spends d_i seconds in addition to the time taken up to that point.So, for example, if the player is at time t_i + sum_d, attempts the trick, fails (taking d_i seconds to recover), then the time becomes t_i + sum_d + d_i. Then, they can choose to reset or continue.But what about the time between tricks? For example, after failing trick i, the player has to proceed to the next part of the route. The time between trick i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. But if the player has failed the trick, does this time get added as well?No, the d_i is the recovery time added. The original route&#39;s time between tricks is already part of the route. So, after failing a trick, the player has to spend d_i seconds (adding to the sum_d), then proceed to the next part of the route (which takes t_{i+1} - t_i seconds). So the time for the run increases by d_i plus (t_{i+1} - t_i).But how does that affect the sum_d?sum_d is the sum of all d&#39;s from failed tricks. So, after failing trick i, sum_d increases by d_i. The time between tricks is part of the original route, so it doesn&#39;t affect sum_d. So the time between i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds, which is added to the run&#39;s time regardless of success or failure.So, when the player attempts trick i:- Success: the time between i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i), sum_d remains the same.- Failure: the sum_d increases by d_i, the time between i and i+1 is still (t_{i+1} - t_i), and the total time of the run is now t_i + sum_d (original sum_d) + d_i (failure) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) (time between tricks) = sum_d + d_i + t_{i+1} + ...? Wait, no.Wait, the original route&#39;s time for trick i is t_i. So, the time between trick i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds, which is part of the route. So, when the player is in state (i, sum_d), the time up to this point is t_i + sum_d. After succeeding or failing the trick, the player moves to the next part of the route (time between i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds).But when you fail, you add d_i to sum_d. So after failing, the sum_d becomes sum_d +d_i. The time between i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the total time for the run up to trick i+1 is t_{i+1} + sum_d +d_i.But sum_d +d_i is the new sum_d for the next state (i+1, sum_d +d_i).So, after failing the trick, the time taken to reach the next trick i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds (from the original route), and the sum_d increases by d_i.So, for the failure case:The time taken to process the failure is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds (time between tricks) plus the d_i seconds (delay). Or is the d_i the only delay added?According to the problem statement: when a trick is failed, the d is added to the time. So, the sum_d increases by d_i. The time between tricks is part of the original route&#39;s time.So, the time taken to reach the next trick after a failure is t_i + sum_d (original time) + d_i (failure) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) (route time between tricks) = sum_d +d_i + t_i + (t_{i+1} -t_i) = sum_d +d_i + t_{i+1}.But sum_d +d_i is the new sum_d, so the time up to the next trick is t_{i+1} + new_sum_d.Which makes sense, because new_sum_d is sum_d +d_i, and the next trick&#39;s time is t_{i+1}.So, in the DP transitions, after failing trick i, the player can choose to reset or continue.But when choosing to continue, they must proceed to the next trick i+1 with sum_d +d_i. However, if sum_d +d_i exceeds (r -n -1), then continuing is impossible, and the player must reset.So, the transitions would look like this:E[i][sum_d] = min(   option_reset,   option_attempt )where option_reset is (t_i + sum_d) + E[0][0]and option_attempt is:p_i * [ (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[i+1][sum_d] ] + (1 - p_i) * [ min( (t_{i+1} - t_i) + continue_expected, (t_i + sum_d) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0} ) ]Wait, but after failing the trick, the sum_d becomes sum_d +d_i, and the time between i and i+1 is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. So the time taken for this step (failure + moving to next trick) is (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds. But the d_i is added to the sum_d.But the decision to reset or continue after the failure depends on whether the new sum_d allows proceeding.So, after failing, the player has to spend (t_{i+1} - t_i) seconds moving to the next trick, and their sum_d is sum_d +d_i.So, after failure, the player can choose to reset, which would add the time up to the current point (t_i + sum_d) + d_i (delay) + (t_{i+1} - t_i) (time between tricks) to the total time, and then start over.Alternatively, if they choose to continue, they proceed to the next trick i+1 with sum_d +d_i, but only if sum_d +d_i &lt;= (r -n -1).So, the expected time after failure is:if sum_d +d_i &gt; (r -n -1):   reset_time = (t_i + sum_d) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0]   expected_time_failure = reset_timeelse:   option_continue = (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[i+1][sum_d +d_i]   option_reset_after_failure = (t_i + sum_d) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0]   expected_time_failure = min(option_continue, option_reset_after_failure)So, putting this all together:option_attempt = p_i * ( (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[i+1][sum_d] )+ (1 - p_i) * (    if sum_d +d_i &gt; r -n -1:       (t_i + sum_d) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0]   else:       min( (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[i+1][sum_d +d_i],             (t_i + sum_d) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0] ))So, the expected time for option_attempt is the sum of the two possibilities (success and failure) multiplied by their probabilities.Then, E[i][sum_d] is the minimum between option_reset and option_attempt.But how do we handle the base case?For the base case, when i == m (all tricks are processed), the sum_d must be such that n + sum_d &lt; r. Then, the total time is n + sum_d. So the expected time for this state is n + sum_d.If sum_d &gt;= r -n, then the run is invalid, and the player must reset. So the expected time in this case is (t_m + sum_d) + E[0][0}, where t_m is the time of the last trick. But wait, after processing all tricks, the time is n seconds (the original route time) plus sum_d. So the total time is n + sum_d. So if this is less than r, then the run is successful. Otherwise, the player must reset.So for the base case:if sum_d &lt;= r -n -1:   E[m][sum_d] = n + sum_delse:   E[m][sum_d] = (t_m + sum_d) + E[0][0} But wait, how do we get the time up to the base case. For i = m, there are no more tricks. So the time after processing all tricks is n + sum_d.But to reach this state, the player must have processed all m tricks. The time taken to reach this state is the time of the last trick (t_m) plus sum_d, plus the time after the last trick (n - t_m). Because the original route time is n, and the last trick is at t_m. So the time between the last trick and the end is (n - t_m).But perhaps that&#39;s already accounted for in the transitions. For example, when transitioning from trick m-1 to m, the time between them is (t_m - t_{m-1}) seconds. Then, after processing trick m, the time up to trick m is t_m + sum_d. The remaining time to finish the route is (n - t_m) seconds. So the total time is t_m + sum_d + (n - t_m) = n + sum_d.So the base case for i = m is that the expected time is n + sum_d, provided that sum_d &lt;= r -n -1. Otherwise, the run is invalid and must reset.So the base case for E[m][sum_d] is:if sum_d &lt;= (r -n -1):   E[m][sum_d] = n + sum_delse:   The run is invalid. The time spent in this run up to the end is t_m + sum_d + (n - t_m) = n + sum_d. But since this is &gt;= r, the player must reset, so the expected time is (n + sum_d) + E[0][0} Wait, but after processing all tricks and failing, the sum_d is such that the run is invalid. So the player has to reset, adding the time of the current run (n + sum_d) to the total and start over. So the expected time is (n + sum_d) + E[0][0}.So for the base case:E[m][sum_d] = min( n + sum_d, (n + sum_d) + E[0][0} )But wait, no. Because if sum_d &lt;= r -n -1, then the run is successful, and the time is n + sum_d. Otherwise, the run is invalid, and the player must reset, which adds (n + sum_d) time to the total and then start over. So the expected time is (n + sum_d) + E[0][0}.But this would be a recursive definition since E[0][0} depends on other states, which could lead to circular dependencies. However, this is manageable through iterative methods like dynamic programming with memoization.Now, the key steps to model the DP are:1. Precompute the tricks&#39; t, p, d.2. Create a DP table where dp[i][s] represents the minimal expected time from state (i, sum_d = s).3. For each state (i, s), compute the minimal expected time by considering the reset option and the attempt option.4. The transitions depend on the next tricks and the possible sum_d values.But how do we handle the dependencies in the DP? For example, E[i][s] depends on E[0][0}, which is the overall expected time. This suggests that the problem has a recursive structure where all states depend on E[0][0}, which in turn depends on other states.This seems like a system of equations where E[0][0} is a variable that depends on other variables. This can be solved using Gaussian elimination, but with the number of possible states (m up to 50, and sum_d up to 5000), this would be computationally infeasible.Alternatively, we can model this as a system of linear equations and use dynamic programming with memoization and iterative methods to find the solution.Alternatively, we can think of the expected time E[i][s] as a linear function of E[0][0}, which allows us to represent each E[i][s] as a constant plus a coefficient multiplied by E[0][0}.For example, E[i][s] = a[i][s] + b[i][s] * E[0][0}.This is possible because the equations are linear in E[0][0}.Let&#39;s see. For example, the reset option for state (i, s) is (t_i + s) + E[0][0}. So this contributes a term of (t_i + s) + E[0][0}.In the attempt option, after failure, there might be a term involving E[0][0} again.By expressing each E[i][s] in terms of E[0][0}, we can eventually set up an equation for E[0][0} in terms of itself and solve for it.This approach can work if the equations are linear in E[0][0}.Let&#39;s try to model this.Assume that for each state (i, s), E[i][s] can be written as a[i][s] + b[i][s] * E[0][0}.Then, for each state, we can compute a[i][s] and b[i][s}.For example, consider the reset option:E[i][s] = (t_i + s) + E[0][0} → a = (t_i + s), b = 1.The attempt option:E_attempt = p_i * ( (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[i+1][s] )+ (1-p_i) * ( ... )The ... part depends on whether sum_d +d_i exceeds the threshold.If sum_d +d_i &gt; (r -n -1), then the failure leads to reset. So:E_failure = (t_i + s) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0} = (t_i + s + d_i + t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0}= (s + d_i + t_{i+1}) ) + E[0][0}.Otherwise, we have to compute the minimum between continue and reset after failure.But this seems complicated. However, if we model a[i][s] and b[i][s} for each state, the equations can be written as:E[i][s] = min( option_reset_a + option_reset_b * E[0][0}, option_attempt_a + option_attempt_b * E[0][0} )But since E[i][s} is the minimum of two options, each of which is a linear function of E[0][0}, this complicates things.Alternatively, perhaps the optimal choice between resetting and attempting is to choose whichever option gives the lower expected time. This requires comparing the two options for each state, which may depend on the value of E[0][0}.But this seems difficult to model.An alternative approach is to consider that the optimal strategy is to reset whenever the expected time of attempting is higher than the expected time of resetting. So for each state (i, s), the optimal choice is to reset if:(t_i + s) + E[0][0} &lt; E_attempt.But E_attempt depends on other states, which may in turn depend on E[0][0}.This seems like a system of equations where E[0][0} is the main variable to solve for.Another approach is to realize that the entire DP can be expressed as a system of equations in terms of E[0][0}. Once we have that, we can solve for E[0][0} by setting up the equation for E[0][0} and solving it.For example, the equation for E[0][0} is:E[0][0} = min( reset_option, attempt_option )where reset_option is (t_0 + 0) + E[0][0} → which is t_0 + E[0][0} → but this is only possible if resetting is better than attempting. However, resetting at the start would mean the player never starts the run, which is impossible. So perhaps in this case, the player must attempt the first trick.But this depends on the optimal choice.But how do we set up these equations?Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a Markov decision process and use value iteration to converge to the optimal expected time.But given the constraints of the problem (n up to 5000, r up to 5000, m up to 50), and sum_d up to (r -n -1), which can be up to 5000 - 2 -1 = 4997 for r=5000 and n=2. That&#39;s a lot of possible sum_d values. For m=50 and sum_d up to 5000, the total number of states is 50*5000 = 250,000. This might be manageable with memoization and iterative methods.Alternatively, we can precompute for each state (i, sum_d) the best option (reset or attempt), and compute the expected time using memoization with a priority queue (like Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm) where states are processed in order of their dependencies.But this might not be feasible.Alternatively, we can use memoization with recursion and memoization tables, but for large states, this could be slow.Hmm. Let&#39;s think of the problem differently. We need to find E[0][0} (the expected time starting from the beginning). All other E[i][s} depend on this value.But how can we compute E[0][0}?Let&#39;s imagine that for each state (i, s), the optimal choice between resetting and attempting is known. Then, the expected time can be written as a linear equation in terms of E[0][0}.But since the optimal choice depends on E[0][0}, this complicates things.Alternatively, we can binary search the value of E[0][0}, and for each candidate value, compute whether it satisfies the equations.But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, the system of equations can be solved iteratively. We start with an initial guess for E[0][0}, compute all E[i][s} values based on this guess, then update E[0][0} and repeat until convergence.But how?For example:1. Initialize E_prev = 0.2. Iterate:   a. Compute all E[i][s} using E_prev as the value for E[0][0}.   b. Compute E_new = E[0][0} from the computed values.   c. If |E_new - E_prev| &lt; epsilon, break. Else, set E_prev = E_new and repeat.But will this converge? It might, especially if the equations are linear and well-behaved.Let&#39;s try to model this.For each state (i, s), the expected time E[i][s} is the minimum between:Option 1: reset now → time = (t_i + s) + E[0][0}Option 2: attempt the trick.The expected time for option 2 is:p_i * [ (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E_next_success ]+ (1 - p_i) * [ failure_time ]where E_next_success is E[i+1][s}, and failure_time is:if s + d_i &gt; r -n -1:   reset_time = (t_i + s) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0} else:   min( (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E_next_failure, reset_time )where E_next_failure is E[i+1][s + d_i}, and reset_time is (t_i + s) + d_i + (t_{i+1} - t_i) + E[0][0}.Assuming that E[i+1][s} and E[i+1][s +d_i} are computed using the current E_prev as E[0][0}.This approach would require that during each iteration, all E[i][s} values are computed based on the current E_prev.So the algorithm would be:- Initialize E_prev = 0.- Repeat:   For all states (i, s), compute E[i][s} based on E_prev.   Compute E_new = E[0][0}.   If E_new is close enough to E_prev, break.   Else, set E_prev = E_new.But how to compute E[i][s} for all states during each iteration?Each state can be processed in reverse order (from i = m down to 0), and sum_d from (r -n -1) down to 0.For each state (i, s), we compute the minimum between option 1 (reset) and option 2 (attempt).During each iteration, the value of E[0][0} is fixed (E_prev), so the computation for each state is straightforward.Once all states are computed, the new E[0][0} is the computed value of the initial state.This process iterates until convergence.This approach is feasible, but the number of iterations needed depends on the convergence speed. Since the problem allows for a relative error of up to 1e-6, we can iterate until the change between consecutive E_prev and E_new is less than 1e-10 or similar.Now, let&#39;s outline the steps to implement this:1. Read the input: n, r, m, then the m tricks.2. Precompute the list of tricks sorted by t (which they already are, according to the input description).3. Compute the maximum possible sum_d: max_sum_d = r -n -1.   If max_sum_d &lt;0, then it&#39;s impossible to beat the record (but according to the problem statement, there&#39;s at least one possibility, so this case won&#39;t occur).4. Precompute the t&#39;s, p&#39;s, d&#39;s of the tricks.5. For each iteration:   a. For each state (i, s), compute the expected time E[i][s} based on the current E_prev (which is the current estimate of E[0][0}).   b. Process the states in reverse order (from i = m down to 0).   c. For each state (i, s):      i. Check if i == m:         if s &lt;= max_sum_d:             E[i][s} = n + s         else:             E[i][s} = (n + s) + E_prev      ii. Else:         current_t = tricks[i].t         next_t = tricks[i+1].t if i+1 &lt;m else n         time_between = next_t - current_t         option_reset = current_t + s + E_prev         option_attempt = 0.0         # Compute success case         p = tricks[i].p         success_time = time_between         next_i = i +1         next_s = s         if next_i &lt; m:             # if next_i is not m, then there are more tricks, so E[next_i][next_s} is computed             success_expected = success_time + E_current[next_i][next_s]         else:             # for i+1 == m, the state is (m, s), which is handled in the base case             # after processing all tricks, the time is n + s             # but we have to add the time between current trick and end             # wait, the time between i and i+1 (where i+1 is m) is next_t - current_t = n - current_t.             # So the time taken is next_t - current_t = n - current_t.             # So the expected time for the success case is (next_t - current_t) + E[next_i][s}             # but E[next_i][s} is (n + s) if s &lt;= max_sum_d.             # So if i+1 is m, then next_i is m, and the expected time for the success case is (n - current_t) + (n + s) if s &lt;= max_sum_d.             # Wait, no. Because the state (m, s) represents the expected time after the last trick. So the success case would proceed to the next trick (m), which is the base case. So the success_expected is (time_between) + E[next_i][s}.             # time_between is next_t - current_t.             # next_t for i+1 = m is tricks[i+1].t, but if i+1 &gt;= m, then next_t is n.             # So when i+1 is m (the last trick), next_t is tricks[m-1].t (since m tricks are 0-based up to m-1).             # Wait, no. For m tricks, i ranges from 0 to m-1. So when i = m-1, i+1 = m, which is beyond the list. So for i = m-1, next_t is n.             # So, for i+1 == m, the next_t is n, and the time_between is n - current_t.         success_expected = time_between + (E_current[next_i][s] if next_i &lt;= m else 0)         # Compute failure case         d = tricks[i].d         new_s = s + d         failure_time_continue = time_between + E_current[next_i][new_s] if new_s &lt;= max_sum_d else float(&#39;inf&#39;)         failure_time_reset = current_t + s + d + time_between + E_prev         if new_s &gt; max_sum_d:             failure_expected = failure_time_reset         else:             failure_expected = min(failure_time_continue, failure_time_reset)         option_attempt = p * success_expected + (1 - p) * failure_expected         E[i][s} = min(option_reset, option_attempt)   d. After processing all states, compute E_new as E[0][0}.   e. Check if the difference between E_new and E_prev is below the threshold. If so, break. Otherwise, update E_prev to E_new and repeat.But wait, the code is a bit more complex. For each iteration, we need to compute E[i][s} based on the current E_prev. But since the computation of E[i][s} depends on E[i+1][s} and E[i+1][new_s}, we need to process the states in reverse order (from i=m down to i=0), and for each sum_d, possibly from max_sum_d down to 0.Moreover, the sum_d can range from 0 to max_sum_d. So for each i, we need to consider all possible s from 0 to max_sum_d.This seems manageable.Now, let&#39;s consider how to represent the E_current and E_prev.Since each iteration depends on the previous state of E[i][s}, we need to store the computed values for all states in each iteration.But for memory efficiency, we can use two arrays: one for the current iteration&#39;s values and one for the previous iteration&#39;s values. However, since during each iteration, we process the states in reverse order, and each state depends only on higher i&#39;s, we can use a single array and update it in-place.But this requires care to ensure that the updates are done correctly.Alternatively, for each iteration, we can create a new 2D array for E_current, then compute each state based on the previous iteration&#39;s E_prev and the new values computed so far.But given that m and max_sum_d are up to 50 and 5000, respectively, a 50 x 5000 array is manageable.So, the plan is:- Initialize E_prev to 0.- Create a DP table, E_current, which is a 2D array of size (m+1) x (max_sum_d + 1). For each iteration, we compute E_current based on E_prev and the previous state of E_current.- For each iteration:   a. Reset E_current to zero or appropriate values.   b. Process i from m down to 0.      For each i, process sum_d from 0 to max_sum_d.      Compute E_current[i][sum_d} based on the current E_prev and the computed E_current[i+1][...} values.   c. After processing all states, compute E_new = E_current[0][0}.   d. Check for convergence.So, during each iteration, the E_current is built from the previous values and the current E_prev.Now, let&#39;s think about the base case for i = m.For each sum_d in 0 to max_sum_d:   if sum_d &lt;= max_sum_d:      E_current[m][sum_d} = n + sum_d   else:      E_current[m][sum_d} = (n + sum_d) + E_prevBut sum_d is up to max_sum_d (r-n-1), so the else case is not possible. So E_current[m][sum_d} = n + sum_d for all sum_d &lt;= max_sum_d.But when sum_d exceeds max_sum_d, which is not possible in the states processed, since sum_d is up to max_sum_d.Wait, no. The sum_d in the DP states can only be up to max_sum_d. For example, when processing state (i, s), s is &lt;= max_sum_d. Because any s beyond that would have been reset immediately.So in the DP table, sum_d ranges from 0 to max_sum_d.So, the base case for i = m is E_current[m][s} = n + s, as long as s &lt;= max_sum_d.But what if during the transitions, sum_d +d_i exceeds max_sum_d? Then, the player must reset, and the expected time for that state is (t_i + s) + d_i + time_between + E_prev.So, for each state (i, s), during the attempt option, we first check if s +d_i exceeds max_sum_d. If so, then after failure, the player must reset.Now, let&#39;s proceed to write code.First, read the input.Then, compute the tricks. Note that the tricks are sorted by t.Next, compute max_sum_d = r -n -1.If max_sum_d &lt;0, then it&#39;s impossible. But according to the problem statement, it&#39;s guaranteed that there&#39;s a possibility.Then, for each iteration:Initialize E_current as a 2D array of size (m+1) x (max_sum_d+1).Process i from m down to 0.For i = m:   for s in 0..max_sum_d:       E_current[m][s] = n + sFor i &lt; m:   for s in 0..max_sum_d:       current_t = tricks[i].t       next_t = tricks[i+1].t if i+1 &lt;m else n       time_between = next_t - current_t       option_reset = current_t + s + E_prev       # compute option_attempt       p = tricks[i].p       d = tricks[i].d       # success case       next_i = i +1       if next_i &lt;= m:           success_expected = time_between + E_current[next_i][s]       else:           # i+1 is m, which is the base case.           success_expected = time_between + (n + s)       # failure case       new_s = s + d       if new_s &gt; max_sum_d:           # must reset           failure_time = current_t + s + d + time_between + E_prev       else:           # compute option continue and reset after failure           # option continue:           if next_i &lt;= m:               continue_time = time_between + E_current[next_i][new_s]           else:               # i+1 is m, new_s &lt;= max_sum_d               continue_time = time_between + (n + new_s)           # option reset after failure:           reset_time = current_t + s + d + time_between + E_prev           failure_time = min(continue_time, reset_time)       option_attempt = p * success_expected + (1 - p) * failure_time       # compute option_attempt and option_reset       E_current[i][s] = min(option_reset, option_attempt)Once all states are processed, the new estimate for E[0][0} is E_current[0][0}.We repeat this process until the change is below a certain threshold.The initial guess for E_prev can be zero.The convergence threshold can be 1e-10, and the maximum number of iterations can be, say, 1000.Once converged, output E_current[0][0}.But wait, when processing i = m-1, next_i is m, so E_current[next_i][s} is E_current[m][s} which is n +s.So the success_expected becomes time_between (n - current_t) + (n + s) → which is (n - current_t) +n +s. But the total time is n + s, which is the base case. Hmm, perhaps this is correct.For example, after successfully processing the last trick (i = m-1), the time between that trick and the end is (n - current_t). So the total time is (current_t + s) + (n - current_t) = n + s. Which matches the base case.Yes.So the code should correctly handle this.Now, testing the sample input 1:Sample Input 1:100 111 520 0.5 1080 0.5 285 0.5 290 0.5 295 0.5 2max_sum_d = 111 -100 -1 =10.The tricks are at 20,80,85,90,95.For i=0 (first trick, t=20):s=0.option_reset =20+0 + E_prev.option_attempt:success: proceed to i=1.time_between =80-20=60.success_expected =60 + E_current[1][0}.failure: new_s =0+10=10 (which is == max_sum_d 10).So new_s=10 &lt;=10. Then, compute continue_time and reset_time after failure.continue_time: time_between 60 + E_current[1][10}.reset_time after failure: 20+0 +10 +60 + E_prev = 90 + E_prev.The failure_time is min(continue_time, 90+ E_prev).The option_attempt is 0.5*(60 + E_current[1][0}) + 0.5 * min(60 + E_current[1][10}, 90 + E_prev).But during the first iteration, E_prev is zero. So the option_attempt would be 0.5*(60 + E_current[1][0}) + 0.5* min(60 + E_current[1][10}, 90).But E_current[1][0} and E_current[1][10} are computed in the same iteration.But in the first iteration, all E_current[i][s} are computed based on E_prev=0.But this is getting complex. Let&#39;s see what the code would compute.But given that the sample output is 124, and the code should compute that.After some iterations, the code should converge to the correct value.So, the approach seems correct.Now, to code this.The code should read the input, set up the tricks, compute max_sum_d, then perform the iterative process until convergence.Now, let&#39;s write the code.First, read n, r, m.Then, read the m tricks, store them in a list.Then, compute max_sum_d = r -n -1.Then, initialize E_prev =0.Set a convergence threshold, like 1e-10.Then, enter a loop:for each iteration:   create a 2D array E_current of size (m+1) x (max_sum_d+1).   process i from m down to 0:      for i ==m:          for s in 0..max_sum_d:              E_current[i][s] =n +s      else:          for s in 0..max_sum_d:              current_t = tricks[i].t              next_t = tricks[i+1].t if i+1 &lt;m else n              time_between = next_t - current_t              option_reset = current_t + s + E_prev              p = tricks[i].p              d = tricks[i].d              # success case              next_i = i+1              if next_i &lt;=m:                  success_expected = time_between + E_current[next_i][s]              else:                  # next_i is m, which is handled in the base case.                  # time_between is n - current_t.                  # then, the time after success is n + s.                  success_expected = time_between + (n + s)              # failure case              new_s = s +d              if new_s &gt; max_sum_d:                  # must reset                  failure_time = current_t + s + d + time_between + E_prev              else:                  # compute continue_time and reset_time after failure                  if next_i &lt;=m:                      continue_time = time_between + E_current[next_i][new_s]                  else:                      continue_time = time_between + (n + new_s)                  reset_time_after_failure = current_t + s + d + time_between + E_prev                  failure_time = min(continue_time, reset_time_after_failure)              option_attempt = p * success_expected + (1-p)* failure_time              # compute E_current[i][s] as the minimum between option_reset and option_attempt              E_current[i][s] = min(option_reset, option_attempt)   # compute E_new as E_current[0][0}   E_new = E_current[0][0]   # check for convergence   if abs(E_new - E_prev) &lt; 1e-10:       break   else:       E_prev = E_newRepeat until convergence.Finally, output E_new with sufficient precision.But what about floating point precision? The problem allows an absolute or relative error of up to 1e-6, so we need to output at least 8 decimal digits.In Python, we can format the output to 10 decimal digits to ensure.Now, let&#39;s test the sample input 1.Sample Input 1:100 111 520 0.5 1080 0.5 285 0.5 290 0.5 295 0.5 2max_sum_d = 111-100-1=10.After processing, the expected time is 124.Let&#39;s see:The code will iterate.In the first iteration, E_prev=0.For i=5 (m=5, the base case):E_current[5][s} =100 + s.For i=4 (the fifth trick at 95):current_t=95, next_t=100.time_between=5.For s=0:option_reset=95 +0 +0 =95.option_attempt:success_expected=5 + E_current[5][0} =5+100+0=105? Wait, no. E_current[5][0} is 100+0=100. So success_expected =5 +100=105.failure:d=2.new_s=0+2=2 &lt;=10.continue_time =5 + E_current[5][2} =5 + (100+2) = 107.reset_time_after_failure =95 +0 +2 +5 +0 =102.failure_time = min(107, 102) →102.option_attempt =0.5*105 +0.5*102 =52.5 +51=103.5.So option_attempt is 103.5, option_reset is 95. So the minimum is 95. So E_current[4][0} =95.But this seems incorrect, but perhaps during iterations, the E_prev will increase and the reset option becomes more expensive.But the code needs to iterate until convergence.But this is difficult to trace manually. The code will compute the correct value after several iterations.Ultimately, the code should output 124 for sample input 1.Thus, the code should be correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal strategy for speedrunning a game to minimize the expected time required to beat the current record. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) to model the expected time for each possible state, considering the probabilities of success and failure at each trick, and the option to reset the game to start over. Approach1. Problem Analysis: The game has a pre-planned path with tricks that can either succeed or fail. Failing a trick incurs a time penalty, and the player can reset the game at any point. The goal is to find the optimal strategy that minimizes the expected time to complete the game and set a new record.2. Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach: We use a DP table where `E[i][s]` represents the minimal expected time starting from the `i-th` trick with an accumulated delay of `s` seconds. The state transitions consider the success and failure probabilities of each trick, the time penalties for failures, and the optimal decision to continue or reset.3. Iterative Method: We iteratively update the DP table until the expected time converges to a stable value. This involves processing each state in reverse order (from the last trick to the first) and updating the expected time based on the current estimates.

Reading Input: The input is read and parsed into the number of tricks and their respective details (time, probability, delay).2. Initialization: The maximum allowable accumulated delay (`max_sum_d`) is computed. This helps in determining if continuing after a failure is feasible.3. Dynamic Programming Table: The DP table `E_current` is initialized to store the expected times for each state. Each state `(i, s)` represents the minimal expected time starting from the `i-th` trick with an accumulated delay `s`.4. State Transitions: For each state, we compute the expected time considering both success and failure scenarios. The optimal decision (continue or reset) is determined by comparing the expected times of both options.5. Convergence Check: The iterative process continues until the expected time converges to a stable value within a specified threshold, ensuring precision in the result.This approach efficiently models the problem using dynamic programming and iterative refinement, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and computationally feasible.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-30f0ed69 data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review" data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review-title" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>❓:</span>itertools.permutations(iterable[, r])This tool returns successive textbf{r} length permutations of elements in an iterable.

Let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s understand the input. The input is a line with space-separated values: the string S and the integer k. For example, the sample input is &quot;HACK 2&quot;, which gives k=2. So I need to split this input into S and k. Oh right, the constraints say 0 &lt; k ≤ len(S), so I don&#39;t have to handle cases where k is zero or larger than the length of S.The output requires all permutations of size k in lex order. Permutations are ordered, so &quot;AB&quot; is different from &quot;BA&quot;. Also, since the sample output shows the permutations sorted lex order, I need to make sure that after generating the permutations, I sort them properly before printing.So the steps are:1. Read the input line and split into S and k.2. Generate all possible k-length permutations of the characters in S.3. Sort these permutations lexicographically.4. Print each permutation as a string, each on a new line.Wait, but how to generate the permutations? Oh right, using itertools.permutations. The permutations function from itertools will give tuples of the elements. For each tuple, I need to join them into a string. For example, (&#39;A&#39;, &#39;C&#39;) becomes &#39;AC&#39;.But also, the input string S might have characters in any order, but the problem states that the output must be in lex order. So even if S is not sorted, the permutations need to be sorted. Wait, looking at the sample input: HACK. Let&#39;s see the characters in HACK are H, A, C, K. If sorted lex order, A, C, H, K. The sample output&#39;s permutations start with AC, AH, AK, etc. So the lex order is based on the sorted characters of S. Wait, but how?Wait, the problem statement says: &quot;Permutations are printed in lexicographic sorted order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the permutation tuples will be produced in a sorted order.&quot; So to ensure that the permutations are generated in lex order, the input to permutations should be sorted first.Ah, that&#39;s the key! Because the itertools.permutations function returns the permutations in the order of the input. So if the input is not sorted, the permutations generated might not be in lex order. Therefore, to get the output in lex order, I should first sort the characters of S, then generate permutations, and then since the input is sorted, the permutations will be generated in lex order, right? Or wait, even if the input is sorted, the permutations generated by itertools.permutations are already in lex order?Wait, the sample code shows that when using permutations on [&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;3&#39;], the output is in lex order. So if the input is sorted, the permutations are generated in lex order. Therefore, to get the permutations sorted, we need to first sort the input string.So the plan is:- Take S, sort its characters, then generate all k-length permutations of the sorted list.For example, in the sample input HACK, the sorted characters are A, C, H, K. Then generating permutations of length 2 from this sorted list will naturally produce the permutations in lex order. Then, we can just output them directly.So the steps are:1. Read S and k from input.2. Convert S into a sorted list of characters. For example, sorted(S) would give a list sorted lex order.3. Generate all permutations of length k using itertools.permutations.4. For each permutation tuple, join the elements into a string.5. Collect all these strings and print them each on a separate line.Wait, but do we need to sort the generated permutations again? Because if the input is sorted, then the permutations are generated in lex order. So for the sample input, after sorting S to A, C, H, K, the permutations would be generated in lex order. So for k=2, the first elements are all starting with A, then C, then H, then K. For each starting character, the permutations are ordered based on the next characters in the sorted list.So no need to sort again. Therefore, the process is:- Sort the characters of S first, then generate permutations of k length, which will be in lex order. Then convert each permutation tuple to a string and print.So the code steps:Read the input line, split into parts. For example, input might be &quot;HACK 2&quot;. Split into [&quot;HACK&quot;, &quot;2&quot;], then k is 2.Then, process S: sorted_S = sorted(S). So sorted_S is [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;K&#39;].Generate permutations of length k from sorted_S. Using itertools.permutations(sorted_S, k).Then, for each permutation in this list, join the elements into a string (e.g., &#39;&#39;.join(permutation)), then print each of these strings in order.So that&#39;s the plan.Now, let&#39;s test this with the sample input.Sample input: HACK 2.sorted_S is [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;H&#39;,&#39;K&#39;].permutations of 2 would be:A C, A H, A K, C A, C H, C K, H A, H C, H K, K A, K C, K H?Wait, but according to the sample output, the first entries are AC, AH, AK, CA, CH, CK, etc. Wait the sample output is:ACAHAKCACHCKHAHCHKKAKCKHWait, the order here is AC, AH, AK, then CA, CH, CK, HA, HC, HK, KA, KC, KH.Wait, when sorted lex order, the permutations would be ordered by the first element first. Since A is first, then C, H, K. For each first element, the second elements are the remaining letters in sorted order.So for A as first element, the next elements are C, H, K (since after removing A, the sorted list is C, H, K). So permutations starting with A would be AC, AH, AK.Then permutations starting with C. When C is first, the remaining letters are A, H, K. So sorted, the next elements are A, H, K. So CA, CH, CK.Then H as first, remaining letters A, C, K. So HA, HC, HK.Then K as first, remaining letters A, C, H. So KA, KC, KH.So the sample output is exactly this order.So, generating permutations from the sorted list gives the correct order, and no further sorting is needed. Thus, the code can be written as:Read S and k.Sort S&#39;s characters.Generate permutations of length k.For each permutation in permutations(sorted_S, k), join and print.So, the code structure would be:import itertoolss, k = input().split()k = int(k)sorted_s = sorted(s)perms = itertools.permutations(sorted_s, k)for p in perms:    print(&#39;&#39;.join(p))But wait, the sample input&#39;s output is in the order AC, AH, AK, CA, CH, CK, HA, HC, HK, KA, KC, KH. Which is the same as the order generated by permutations of the sorted list. Let&#39;s test.sorted_s is [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;H&#39;,&#39;K&#39;]permutations of 2 would generate:(&#39;A&#39;,&#39;C&#39;), (&#39;A&#39;,&#39;H&#39;), (&#39;A&#39;,&#39;K&#39;), (&#39;C&#39;,&#39;A&#39;), (&#39;C&#39;,&#39;H&#39;), (&#39;C&#39;,&#39;K&#39;), (&#39;H&#39;,&#39;A&#39;), (&#39;H&#39;,&#39;C&#39;), (&#39;H&#39;,&#39;K&#39;), (&#39;K&#39;,&#39;A&#39;), (&#39;K&#39;,&#39;C&#39;), (&#39;K&#39;,&#39;H&#39;).Joining each gives AC, AH, AK, CA, CH, CK, HA, HC, HK, KA, KC, KH. Which matches the sample output. So yes, the code works.But wait, in the sample output, the order is AC, AH, AK, CA, CH, CK, etc. So the code produces the correct output.Therefore, the code should be as described.Now, the code needs to read from stdin, process, and print. So the function needs to be called.But according to the problem statement, the function must take stdin as input and print the output. But the code can be written as a script that reads input, processes, and prints. But the user says to generate an executable Python function, call it after the definition.So the code should be structured as a function, then called.So the code would be:import sysfrom itertools import permutationsdef main():    # Read input    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()    s, k = input_line.split()    k = int(k)    # Sort the characters of S    sorted_s = sorted(s)    # Generate permutations    perms = permutations(sorted_s, k)    # Print each permutation joined as a string    for p in perms:        print(&#39;&#39;.join(p))if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()But wait, the input line is read as a single line. So for example, the input is &quot;HACK 2&quot; as a single line. Using input().split() would split into [&#39;HACK&#39;, &#39;2&#39;], but using sys.stdin.read().strip().split() would work as well.Alternatively, using input().split() would work, because in Python, input() reads until a newline. So if the input is a single line, input() is sufficient. So perhaps the code can be written as:def main():    s, k = input().split()    k = int(k)    chars = sorted(s)    for p in permutations(chars, k):        print(&#39;&#39;.join(p))But the problem says the function should take stdin as input. So using input() is correct as it reads from stdin.Wait, in Python, the input() function reads from stdin by default. So the code should work.Testing with the sample input:Input line is &quot;HACK 2&quot;s becomes &#39;HACK&#39;, k becomes 2.sorted(s) is sorted(&#39;HACK&#39;) which is [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;K&#39;].permutations of 2:The code will generate all possible 2-length permutations in order. Then, for each, join and print.Which gives the correct sample output.So the code is correct.Another test case: if S is &#39;ABC&#39;, k=3. Then permutations of the sorted list ([&#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;,&#39;C&#39;]) would generate all 6 permutations, in order ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA. Which is lex order.Another edge case: k equals len(S). Then permutations would be all possible full-length permutations. For example, S=&#39;AB&#39;, k=2. Sorted S is [&#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;]. permutations are (&#39;A&#39;,&#39;B&#39;) and (&#39;B&#39;,&#39;A&#39;), which printed as AB and BA. But since the input is sorted, the first permutation is AB, then BA. But in lex order, AB comes before BA. So that&#39;s correct.Thus, the code handles all cases correctly.So the final code is as written.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible permutations of a given string of size `k` and print them in lexicographic sorted order.

So, the task is to find the maximum possible difference in points between the first and second-placed teams in a football league where each team plays every other team once. No draws, so every game gives 3 points to the winner. We need to find this maximum difference for a given number of teams N.First, let&#39;s understand the structure of the tournament. Each team plays N-1 matches. Because each team plays every other once. For example, if there are 4 teams, each plays 3 matches.The key here is to arrange the results in such a way that the first team (let&#39;s call it Team A) wins as many matches as possible, while the remaining teams&#39; results are arranged such that the second-highest points are minimized. Because the difference is (A&#39;s points) minus (second&#39;s points), to maximize the difference, A should have maximum possible points (so wins all their matches), and the second team should have as few points as possible.Wait, but how? Because after Team A, the other teams play among themselves. So the second-place team could get points from those matches. We need to arrange the results so that the maximum among the other teams is as small as possible.Let&#39;s think step by step.Case 1: N=2. Only two teams. They play once. The winner gets 3, the other 0. So difference is 3. That&#39;s the sample input 1.Case 2: N=3. Three teams. Team A plays against B and C. If A wins both, then B and C play each other. Suppose B beats C. Then A has 6 points (2 wins), B has 3 (1 win), C has 0. The second place is B with 3. Difference is 6-3=3. Which matches sample 2.Case 3: N=4. Team A wins all 3 matches (9 points). The other three teams (B, C, D) need to arrange their matches so that the maximum among them is as low as possible. Let&#39;s see: B beats C, C beats D, D beats B. Then each of B, C, D has 3 points. So the second place is 3. Difference is 9-3=6. Which matches sample 3.So for N=4, the maximum difference is 6.Sample 4: N=9. The first team wins all 8 matches (24 points). Then the remaining 8 teams must be arranged such that the maximum among them is 12. How?Hmm. Let&#39;s think. For the remaining 8 teams, how do their results affect the maximum possible points. To minimize the second place, we want the remaining teams to distribute their wins in a way that no team gets more than X points. So how?Wait, when the first team (A) has 24 points (8 wins), the other 8 teams play 8*7/2=28 matches among themselves. Each of these matches contributes 3 points. So total points for the other teams is 28*3=84. But how to distribute these points such that the maximum is minimized.But perhaps the way to arrange this is that all other teams form a cycle where each team wins against half and loses to half. For example, in the case of N=4, the three teams form a cycle where each has one win and one loss. But that gives each 3 points.Wait, perhaps the optimal scenario is to have the other teams form a chain where each team beats the next one. For example, in the case of N=9, the remaining 8 teams could be arranged such that each team beats exactly half of the others. Wait, but with 8 teams, each plays 7 games. So if each team wins 4 and loses 3, they get 12 points. Then the maximum among them is 12, leading to a difference of 24-12=12. Which matches the sample.So the pattern seems to be:For N teams, the maximum difference is 3*( (N-1) - floor( (N-2)/2 ) )Wait, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s think for each N:The first team wins all (N-1) games, so 3*(N-1) points.The remaining (N-1) teams play among themselves. To minimize the maximum points among them, arrange their games so that each of them wins exactly floor( (N-2)/2 ) games. Because each of these teams has (N-2) games (since they don&#39;t play against the first team). So if each wins half (rounded down) of those, their points are 3 * floor( (N-2)/2 ). But wait, for even and odd cases?Wait, let&#39;s take N=3. The remaining two teams (after A) play each other. So each can have 0 or 3. But the maximum is 3. Wait, but according to our formula, floor( (3-2)/2 ) = floor(1/2) = 0. Then the maximum would be 0, which is not correct. So that formula is wrong.Hmm. So perhaps the correct approach is to see that in the remaining (N-1) teams, the maximum possible points that the second team can have is 3 * (k-1), where k is the number of teams in the group. Wait, maybe not.Wait, for N=3: after team A (who has 6 points), the other two teams (B and C) play each other. The maximum of those two is 3. So difference is 6-3=3.For N=4: the other three teams (B, C, D) each play two games against each other. Each team plays two games (against the other two). So each of them has two games. The arrangement is B beats C, C beats D, D beats B. So each team wins once and loses once, getting 3 points. So maximum is 3. Difference 9-3=6.For N=9: remaining 8 teams. Each plays 7 games. The maximum possible points for the second place is 12. How?If each of the 8 teams wins 4 games (since 7 games: 4 wins and 3 losses), 4*3=12. Then the maximum is 12. So difference is 24-12=12.So the formula for the second place&#39;s maximum is 3 * floor( (N-2)/1 )? Wait no. Let&#39;s think again.Wait, in the case of N teams, the first team has (N-1) wins, points 3*(N-1).The remaining (N-1) teams each play (N-2) matches (since they don&#39;t play against the first team). So for these (N-1) teams, each can have a maximum of 3*(N-2) points if they win all their matches. But that&#39;s not possible, because each of them plays against the others. So the question is, how can we arrange their matches so that the maximum points among them is as small as possible.Wait, the goal is to arrange the other (N-1) teams such that the maximum points they get is minimized. Because that way, the difference between the first and second is maximized.So, for example, when the remaining teams are arranged in a circular way, each team beats some and loses to others, but the maximum number of wins is as low as possible.In the case of (N-1) teams, each plays (N-2) games. To minimize the maximum, perhaps the best is to have all teams except one lose all their matches except against one team. Wait, perhaps not. Let&#39;s think for N=9, where the remaining 8 teams are arranged such that each has 4 wins (so 4*3=12 points). How is that possible? Each of the 8 teams plays 7 matches. So 8 teams, each with 4 wins and 3 losses. But how?Wait, in a group of 8 teams, each with 4 wins and 3 losses, the total number of wins is 8 *4 =32. But in the group, each match contributes exactly one win. The total number of matches is 8C2 =28. So the total wins would be 28. But 32 is more than 28. So this is impossible. Therefore, this approach can&#39;t be correct.Wait, so there&#39;s a mistake here. For the remaining (N-1) teams, each plays (N-2) matches. The total number of matches is (N-1)(N-2)/2. Each match contributes one win, so total wins in this subgroup is (N-1)(N-2)/2. So the average number of wins per team in this subgroup is (N-2)/2.So, for example, when N=9, the remaining 8 teams have 8*7/2 =28 matches. Each contributes 3 points, so total points is 28*3=84. The average per team is 84/8=10.5. So the maximum possible points a team can have here must be at least ceil(10.5) =11. But according to sample input 4, the maximum is 12. Hmm, that contradicts.Wait, in sample 4, N=9. The first team has 24 points. The second team has 12. But according to the calculation above, if 8 teams have 84 points, and the maximum is 12, then the sum would be 12 + sum of others. But 12 *8 is 96, which is larger than 84. So that can&#39;t be.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample explanation. Wait, for N=9, sample output is 12. The explanation says the first team has 24 points, second has 12. But how?Wait, let&#39;s think again. For N=9:The first team (A) plays 8 matches, wins all, so 24 points.The remaining 8 teams (B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I) play 8*7/2 =28 matches among themselves. Each of these matches gives 3 points (to the winner). So total points for these 8 teams is 28*3=84 points.The maximum possible points any of these 8 teams can have is when one team wins all their 7 matches. But that would give 21 points. However, that would make the second team have 21 points, leading to a difference of 24-21=3, which is much lower than the sample output of 12. So that&#39;s not the scenario.But sample 4 says the maximum difference is 12, achieved when the first has 24 and second has 12. So how?Ah, perhaps the remaining teams are arranged such that each team wins half of their matches (rounded down), but how?Wait, perhaps the idea is that the remaining teams form a structure where each team wins exactly (k-1) games, where k is the number of teams in the subgroup. Wait, perhaps not.Alternatively, perhaps the optimal scenario is when the remaining (N-1) teams are split into two groups. One team (B) wins all matches against teams in one group and loses all matches against another group, but the other group&#39;s teams all lose to each other. Wait, perhaps not.Alternatively, perhaps the remaining teams form a chain: B beats C, C beats D, D beats E, etc. But then B would have a lot of wins.Alternatively, think of a scenario where one team (B) wins all but one of their matches, but that&#39;s not helpful.Wait, perhaps the answer is that when the remaining (N-1) teams are arranged such that each team has exactly one more loss than wins against the others. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible for the second team is when (N-1) is even, the maximum is 3*( (N-2)/2 ), and when (N-1) is odd, it&#39;s 3*( (N-3)/2 ). Let&#39;s test this.For N=2: remaining 1 team. (N-1=1). Then (N-2)/2 is (0)/2=0. So 0 points. So difference is 3. Which is correct.For N=3: remaining 2 teams. (N-1=2). (2-1)/2 = (1)/2=0.5, floor to 0. So 0 points. But in reality, one of them must have 3. So this formula is incorrect.So perhaps the formula is that the second team&#39;s maximum is 3*(k-1), where k is (N-1) teams. Wait, when N=3, k=2, so 3*(2-1)=3, which matches.For N=4, k=3. 3*(3-1)=6. But sample output is 3. So that&#39;s wrong.Hmm, this approach is not working. Let&#39;s re-examine the problem.The first team A has 3*(N-1) points. The other (N-1) teams each have to play against each other. How can we arrange their results such that the maximum points among them is as small as possible.The key here is to arrange their matches in such a way that no team gets too many points. The maximum possible points of the second team in this group is what determines the difference.So, the question reduces to: given (N-1) teams, each playing (N-2) matches, arrange the results such that the maximum points any team has is minimized.This is equivalent to finding the minimal possible maximum points in a tournament of (N-1) teams where each plays every other once. So the problem is to find the minimal possible maximum, given that all teams are arranged optimally.This is a known problem in graph theory. For example, in a round-robin tournament, the minimal possible maximum number of wins is the ceiling of (k-1)/2, where k is the number of teams. Because each team can have at most floor((k-1)/2) wins and ceil((k-1)/2) losses. Wait, no. Wait, in a tournament where every pair plays once, the minimal maximum number of wins possible is the ceiling of (k-1)/2. Because if you arrange the results such that each team has as equal number of wins as possible.Wait, let&#39;s think of it this way: For k teams, each plays k-1 matches. The total number of wins is k*(k-1)/2, because each match contributes one win. So the average number of wins per team is (k-1)/2. So the maximum possible minimal maximum is the ceiling of (k-1)/2. Because if (k-1) is even, then each team can have (k-1)/2 wins and (k-1)/2 losses. If (k-1) is odd, then each team can have (k-1-1)/2 = (k-2)/2 wins and (k-1+1)/2 = k/2 losses. Wait, no. Wait, for example, when k is 3 (N=4), the remaining 3 teams play 3 matches. The total wins are 3. So average is 1 per team. So each team can have 1 win and 1 loss, and one team has an extra loss. Wait, but how?Wait, for k=3 teams (B, C, D), each plays two matches. The minimal possible maximum number of wins is 1. Because if B beats C, C beats D, D beats B, then each has 1 win. So maximum is 1, which is (k-1)/2 (3-1)/2=1. So that works.For k=4 teams, each plays 3 matches. The average is 3/2=1.5. So the maximum possible minimal maximum is 2. How? If each team has one win and two losses, that&#39;s impossible because total wins would be 4*1=4, but total matches is 4*3/2=6. So 6 wins total. So 6 wins /4 teams= 1.5. So the maximum is 2. For example, two teams have 2 wins, two teams have 1 win. Or one team has 3 wins, others have 1.5, but since it&#39;s integer, perhaps arrange it such that two teams have 2 wins each, and the others have 1. Then maximum is 2.But how to arrange this. For example, arrange a cycle where each team beats two others and loses to one. Hmm, but in four teams, each has three matches. So perhaps arrange two teams (B and C) who win against two teams each, and D and E (if k=4) have one win each. Wait, perhaps a better way: split the four teams into two pairs. Each pair&#39;s team beats the other pair. Then in each pair, the two teams split their matches. For example:B beats C and D. C beats B and E. D beats E and B. E beats D and C. Wait, not sure. Maybe this is getting complicated.But perhaps the minimal possible maximum number of wins is floor((k-1)/2). Or maybe ceil((k-1)/2). Let&#39;s test.For k=2: (k-1)/2 = 0.5, ceil is 1. But for two teams, one must have 1 win, the other 0. So maximum is 1. Which is correct.For k=3: ceil((3-1)/2) = 1. Which matches the example.For k=4: ceil((4-1)/2) = 2. So maximum wins is 2, which is possible. For example, arrange the four teams in a way where each team has two wins. But how? That&#39;s possible. Let&#39;s see:Each team plays three matches. For four teams, how can all have two wins? Each has two wins and one loss. But 4 teams ×2 wins =8 wins. Total matches are 6, which contribute 6 wins. 8&gt;6. So that&#39;s impossible. So the minimal maximum can&#39;t be 2. Wait, that&#39;s a contradiction. So perhaps the minimal maximum is 2 when k=4.Wait, but how? For four teams (B, C, D, E). Let&#39;s arrange their matches:B beats C and D. C beats D and E. D beats E and B. E beats B and C. Wait, this seems like each has two wins. But that&#39;s impossible because each match is between two teams. Let&#39;s check:B vs C: B wins.B vs D: B wins.B vs E: E wins.So B has two wins, one loss.C vs D: C wins.C vs E: C wins.C vs B: C loses.So C has two wins (against D and E), one loss (to B).D vs E: D wins.D vs B: D loses.D vs C: D loses.So D has one win (against E) and two losses. So maximum is B and C have 2 wins. So the maximum is 2. So yes, the maximum can be 2. So for k=4, the minimal maximum is 2. Which is ceil((4-1)/2)=2.But how? Wait, for k=4, the (k-1) is 3. So ceil(3/2)=2. So yes. So for k teams, the minimal maximum wins is ceil((k-1)/2). Then, the points for that team would be 3 * ceil( (k-1)/2 ), where k = N-1.So the maximum difference between the first and second is:3*(N-1) - 3*ceil( (k-1)/2 ), where k = N-1.Wait, no. Because k is (N-1) (the number of teams in the subgroup). So for the subgroup of (N-1) teams, the minimal maximum wins is ceil( ( (N-1) - 1 ) / 2 ), since each team plays (N-2) games (since they don&#39;t play against the first team). Wait, no. Wait, in the subgroup of (N-1) teams, each plays (N-2) games. So k in this context is (N-1) teams, each plays (N-2) games. So the number of wins per team can be up to (N-2) wins. But we want the minimal maximum number of wins, which is ceil( (N-2)/2 ). Because:The total number of wins in the subgroup is (N-1)*(N-2)/2 (since there are (N-1 choose 2) matches). The average number of wins per team is (N-2)/2. So the minimal possible maximum is either floor( (N-2)/2 ) or ceil( (N-2)/2 ), depending on how it&#39;s arranged.Wait, for example, when N=9, the subgroup has 8 teams, each plays 7 games. The average is 7/2=3.5. So the minimal possible maximum is 4 (ceil(3.5)), which gives 4*3=12 points, which matches the sample. For N=4, subgroup of 3 teams, each plays 2 games. The average is 1. So maximum is 1 (ceil(2/2) =1). So 1*3=3 points, which matches the sample.So the formula for the maximum difference is:3*(N-1) - 3 * floor( (N-2)/2 )Wait, wait. Let&#39;s see:For N=9: (N-2) is 7. floor(7/2) =3. 3*3=9. 24-9=15. Which is not the sample&#39;s 12. Hmm. So that&#39;s not correct.Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is 3*(N-1) - 3* ( (N-2) // 2 ). Let&#39;s check:For N=3: (3-1) =2. (3-2) =1. 1//2=0. So 3*2 - 3*0=6. But sample output is 3. So that&#39;s wrong.Wait, perhaps the formula is 3*(N-1) - 3*( (N-2) // 2 ), but this would be incorrect for N=3. So perhaps I&#39;m missing something.Wait, perhaps the minimal maximum number of wins in the subgroup is floor( (N-2)/2 ). Let&#39;s check:For N=3: subgroup has 2 teams. Each plays 1 game. So one team has 1 win, the other 0. So maximum is 1. Which is (3-2) =1, floor(1/2)=0. Not matching. So this approach is wrong.Ah, perhaps the minimal maximum is ceil( (N-2)/2 ). Let&#39;s see:N=3: (3-2)=1. ceil(1/2) =1. So 1*3=3. 3*(3-1)=6. 6-3=3. Correct.N=4: (4-2)=2. ceil(2/2)=1. 1*3=3. 3*(4-1)=9. 9-3=6. Correct.N=9: (9-2)=7. ceil(7/2) =4. 4*3=12. 24-12=12. Correct.Sample input N=2: subgroup has 1 team. (2-2)=0. ceil(0/2)=0. So 3*1 (the first team&#39;s points) minus 0 =3. Correct.So this seems to fit all the samples. Therefore, the formula is:max_diff = 3 * (N-1) - 3 * ceil( (N-2)/2 )But wait, how to compute ceil( (N-2)/2 )?For even (N-2):If N-2 is even, then ceil( (N-2)/2 ) = (N-2)/2.For example, N=4: N-2=2 even. 2/2=1. Which is correct.For odd (N-2):N=3: N-2=1. ceil(1/2)=1.N=9: N-2=7. ceil(7/2)=4.So the formula for ceil( (N-2)/2 ) can be written as (N-2 +1 ) //2 = (N-1)//2.Because:For even (N-2):N-2 = 2k → (2k +1)/2 = (2k+1) //2 = k + 0.5, but integer division would give k.Wait, let&#39;s check:For N-2 even: N-2 = 2k.ceil(2k/2) =k.(N-2 +1)/2 = (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5. But (2k+1) divided by 2 via integer division would be k.Wait, no. For example, N-2=7 (N=9). (7+1)/2=8/2=4. Which is correct.For N-2=2 (N=4): (2+1)/2=3/2=1.5, integer division would give 1. Which is correct.Yes. So ceil( (N-2)/2 ) is equal to (N-1) // 2.Because (N-2)/2 is equal to (N-1 -1)/2. Adding 1 and flooring gives the same as ceil.So substituting ceil( (N-2)/2 ) = (N-1) // 2.So the formula becomes:max_diff = 3*(N-1) - 3 * ( (N-1) // 2 )= 3 * [ (N-1) - ( (N-1) // 2 ) ]Let&#39;s test this formula:For N=2:(N-1) =1. (1//2)=0. 1-0=1 → 3*1=3. Correct.For N=3:3-1=2. (2//2)=1. 2-1=1 → 3*1=3. Correct.For N=4:4-1=3. (3//2)=1. 3-1=2 → 6. Correct.For N=9:9-1=8. (8//2)=4. 8-4=4 → 3*4=12. Correct.So the formula works for all the samples.Now, we need to compute this for a given N.The formula is 3 * ( (N-1) - ( (N-1) // 2 ) )Simplifying this:(N-1) - floor( (N-1)/2 ) = ceil( (N-1)/2 )Because (N-1) can be even or odd.For example, if N-1 is even:even number, say 4. 4 -4//2=4-2=2 = 4/2=2 → yes.If N-1 is odd:5. 5-2=3. ceil(5/2)=3. Correct.So (N-1) - floor( (N-1)/2 ) = ceil( (N-1)/2 )So the formula can be written as 3 * ceil( (N-1)/2 )But wait, let&#39;s see:For N=2: (2-1)/2=0.5 → ceil(0.5)=1. 3*1=3. Correct.N=3: (3-1)/2=1 → ceil(1)=1 → 3*1=3. Correct.N=4: (4-1)/2=1.5 → ceil(1.5)=2 → 3*2=6. Correct.N=9: (9-1)/2=4 → 3*4=12. Correct.So the formula simplifies to 3 * ceil( (N-1)/2 )But how to compute ceil( (N-1)/2 )?Since N can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way.But (N-1) is an integer. So ceil( (N-1)/2 ) is equal to (N-1 +1 ) // 2 when (N-1) is odd, and (N-1)/2 when even.Alternatively, (N-1 +1 ) // 2 is the same as (N) // 2.Because:If N-1 is even: let&#39;s say N-1 =2k. Then N=2k+1. So (N) //2 = (2k+1)//2 =k. But (N-1)/2=2k/2=k. So ceil( (N-1)/2 ) is k. (2k/2= k).If N-1 is odd: N-1=2k+1. Then N=2k+2. So (N)//2 = (2k+2)//2= k+1. (N-1)/2= (2k+1)/2= k+0.5 → ceil is k+1.So in both cases, ceil( (N-1)/2 ) is equal to (N) //2.So the formula becomes 3 * (N//2) when N is even or odd.Wait, let&#39;s test:N=2: N//2=1. 3*1=3. Correct.N=3: 3//2=1. 3*1=3. Correct.N=4:4//2=2 → 6. Correct.N=9:9//2=4 → 12. Correct.Yes. So the formula is 3 * (N//2).Wait, that can&#39;t be. Because when N=3, (3//2)=1, 3*1=3. Which is correct.Wait, this is a major simplification. So the maximum difference is 3 * (N // 2). But wait:Wait, let&#39;s check for N=5.According to our formula, 5//2=2. 3*2=6.What&#39;s the actual maximum difference for N=5.First team wins all 4 matches: 12 points.The remaining 4 teams play each other. To minimize the maximum.The minimal maximum points would be 3 * ceil( (5-2)/2 )=3 * ceil(3/2) =3*2=6.So the second team would have 6 points. So difference is 12-6=6. Which matches 3*(5//2) =3*2=6.Another test case: N=6.According to formula, 6//2=3 → 9.First team has 5*3=15 points.The remaining 5 teams have to have a maximum of 3 * (5-1)/2 =3*2=6. Wait, no. Let&#39;s compute according to the formula.No, according to previous analysis, the formula is 3*(N//2). For N=6, 3*3=9.So the first team has 5*3=15. The remaining 5 teams, each plays 4 matches.The maximum points is 3 * ceil( (5-1)/2 ) =3*2=6. So difference is 15-6=9. Which matches the formula.So yes, the formula works.So the conclusion is that the maximum difference is 3*(N//2).Wait, but how?Because when N is even, like N=4, N//2=2. 3*2=6. Which is correct.When N is odd, like N=5, N//2=2. 3*2=6. Correct.So regardless of whether N is even or odd, the maximum difference is 3*(N//2).So this is a much simpler formula than I thought.But how did this happen? Because when I thought through the problem, the formula transformed from 3*(N-1 - ( (N-1)//2 )) to 3*( (N-1) - floor( (N-1)/2 )), which is equivalent to 3*ceil( (N-1)/2 ), which is equal to 3*( (N) // 2 )Because:ceil( (N-1)/2 ) = (N) // 2.Yes.So the formula simplifies to 3*(N//2).Thus, for any N &gt;=2, the maximum difference is 3*(N//2).But wait, let&#39;s check for N=9. 9//2=4. 3*4=12. Correct.Yes.So the problem reduces to, for each test case N, output 3*(N//2).But wait, what about N=1? But the constraints say N&gt;=2.So the code is straightforward. For each N, compute 3 * (N//2).But wait, how does this fit with the earlier examples?Let me check sample input 1:Test case 1: N=2 → 3*(2//2) =3. Correct.Test case 2: N=3 →3*(3//2)=3*1=3. Correct.Test case 3: N=4 →3*2=6. Correct.Test case 4: N=9 →3*4=12. Correct.Yes. So the code can simply be for each N, output 3*(N//2).But how? Because when I initially thought through the problem, it seemed like a more complicated formula. But the final formula is incredibly simple.So why does this work? Because the maximum difference is 3 multiplied by the floor division of N by 2.This suggests that the answer is simply 3*(N//2) for each test case.But let&#39;s confirm with N=5. As we saw, the difference is 6, which is 3*(5//2) →3*2=6. Correct.Another example: N=6. 3*(6//2) =3*3=9.The first team has 5*3=15 points. The remaining 5 teams must have a maximum of 6 points (as per the formula 3* (5//2) →3*2=6). So 15-6=9. Correct.So the formula holds.Thus, the solution is to compute 3*(N//2) for each N.So the code can be written as:Read T test cases. For each N, print 3*(N//2).So the code is straightforward.Now, considering the constraints, T can be up to 1e5 and N up to 1e9. The code must read inputs quickly and process them.In Python, reading from stdin can be slow if using input() for each test case. So, it&#39;s better to read all input at once.The code would be:Read T.Read T lines, for each line, compute N as integer.For each N, compute 3*(N//2).Print each result.But since N can be up to 1e9, but in Python, integer division is straightforward.So the code is as follows:import sysdef main():    import sys    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    T = int(input[0])    for i in range(1, T+1):        N = int(input[i])        print(3 * (N // 2))        main()But this can be optimized by reading all data at once and processing.Alternatively, using a generator:But for speed, using sys.stdin.read() and splitting into a list is better.Testing the sample input:Sample Input 1:42349Sample Output:33612The code would compute:2//2=1 →3*1=3.3//2=1 →3*1=3.4//2=2 →3*2=6.9//2=4 →3*4=12.Which matches the samples.Thus, the code is correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible difference in points between the first-placed team and the second-placed team in a football league where each team plays every other team exactly once. The key insight is to maximize the points of the first team while minimizing the points of the second-placed team. Approach1. Understanding the Tournament Structure: Each team plays every other team once, resulting in each team playing (N-1) matches. The first-placed team wins all its matches, earning (3 times (N-1)) points.2. Minimizing Second Place Points: The remaining (N-1) teams play among themselves. The optimal arrangement to minimize the second-placed team&#39;s points is when each team wins about half of their matches. This results in the second-placed team having points close to (3 times leftlfloor frac{N-1}{2} rightrfloor).3. Formula Derivation: The maximum difference is calculated as (3 times (N-1) - 3 times leftlfloor frac{N-1}{2} rightrfloor), which simplifies to (3 times leftlfloor frac{N}{2} rightrfloor). Solution Code```pythonimport sysdef main():    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    T = int(input[0])    results = []    for i in range(1, T + 1):        N = int(input[i])        results.append(3 * (N // 2))    print(&#39;n&#39;.join(map(str, results)))if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation- Reading Input Efficiently: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints where (T) can be up to (10^5).- Processing Each Test Case: For each test case, the value (N) is converted to an integer. The maximum difference is computed using integer division to handle both even and odd values of (N) efficiently.- Output: The results for all test cases are collected in a list and printed at once to minimize I/O operations, which is crucial for handling large input sizes efficiently.This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible points difference using a direct mathematical formula, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of (O(T)).</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-30f0ed69 data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review" data-v-c5b64b40><div class="review-title" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>❓:</span>Mirko is trying to debug a piece of his code. First he creates an array of N integers and fills it with zeros. Then he repeatedly calls the following C++ procedure:void something( int jump ) {  int i = 0;  while( i &lt; N ) { seq[i] = seq[i] + 1; i = i + jump;  }}As you can see, this procedure increases by one all elements in the array whose indices are divisible by jump.Mirko calls the procedure exactly K times, using the sequence X_1,X_2,X_3, ldots , X_ k as arguments.After this, Mirko has a list of Q special parts of the array he needs to check to verify that his code is working as it should be. Each of these parts is defined by two numbers, L and R (L leq R) the left and right bound of the special part. To check the code, Mirko must compute the sum of all elements of seq between and including L and R. In other words mathtt{seq}[L] + mathtt{seq}[L+1] + mathtt{seq}[L+2] + ldots + mathtt{seq}[R].

The problem is about simulating an array after certain operations and then answering multiple range sum queries. Hmm. Let me think through this.So the array starts with all zeros. Each call to the function increases every element at indices divisible by &#39;jump&#39; by 1. So, for each X_i in the K calls, we add 1 to all multiples of X_i. Then, for Q queries, we need to compute the sum from L to R inclusive.The constraints are tight. N and K can be up to 1e6, Q is up to 1e6 as well. So a naive approach of updating the array each time and then using prefix sums won&#39;t work because each update could take O(N) time, which is 1e12 operations in the worst case. That&#39;s way too slow.Wait, right. So we need a smarter way to represent the data. Let&#39;s think about how each element in the array is incremented. Each element seq[i] is equal to the number of X_j in the K calls that divide i. Because each time a X_j is called, all multiples of X_j (including i if X_j divides i) get a +1. So for each i, the count is the number of X_j that are divisors of i.So the sum from L to R is the sum over i=L to R of the count of X_j that divide i. So the problem reduces to, for each query [L, R], compute the total number of X_j that divides any integer between L and R inclusive.So the problem becomes: pre-process the list of X&#39;s, and for each query [L, R], count how many X_j&#39;s divide any number in [L, R], summed over all X_j.Hmm. How do we compute that efficiently?But wait, no. For each X_j, how many numbers between L and R are divisible by X_j? That&#39;s the number of multiples of X_j in that interval. Each such number contributes 1 to the sum. So the total sum for all queries is the sum over all X_j of the number of multiples of X_j in [L, R] for each query.So for each query, the answer is the sum for each X_j in the list of floor(R / X_j) - floor( (L-1) / X_j ) ) ?Yes. Exactly. Because for each X_j, the number of integers between L and R that are multiples of X_j is the count of multiples up to R minus the count up to L-1.So the problem now is, given K numbers X_1 to X_K, and Q queries [L, R], compute for each query the sum over all X_j of ( floor(R / X_j) - floor( (L-1)/X_j ) ).The challenge is to compute this efficiently for a large number of queries and a large K.But K can be up to 1e6, and Q up to 1e6. If for each query, we iterate over all K X_j&#39;s, that&#39;s 1e12 operations, which is impossible.So we need a way to precompute some information that allows us to answer each query quickly.Alternative approach: group the X_j&#39;s by their value, and count the frequency of each X. Then, for each possible d, let freq[d] be the number of times d appears in X_j&#39;s. Then, for a query [L, R], the answer is sum over d of freq[d] * (count of multiples of d in [L, R]).So the problem becomes, for each d in the unique X_j&#39;s, compute how many times d occurs (freq[d]), multiply by the number of multiples of d in [L, R], and sum all these.This way, the number of unique d&#39;s is up to 1e6, but perhaps in practice much less if there are duplicates. However, if all X_j&#39;s are unique, then it&#39;s still 1e6 unique d&#39;s, which for Q=1e6 would result in 1e12 operations again. So that&#39;s still not feasible.So we need a better approach. Let&#39;s think about the mathematical expression for the sum.The sum for a query is sum_{d=1 to max_d} freq[d] * ( floor(R/d) - floor( (L-1)/d ) )We need to compute this sum efficiently for multiple queries.Hmm. This looks similar to some number theory problems where you precompute divisors or something. But how?Let me think. The key is to preprocess the frequencies for each d, and then for a query, compute the sum over all d of freq[d] multiplied by (number of multiples in [L, R]).But even with that, for each query, iterating all possible d&#39;s is O(max_d) per query, which is up to 1e6 per query and 1e6 queries: 1e12 operations again. Not feasible.Alternative idea: For each possible d, precompute a frequency array, then for each query, the sum can be found by a sieve-like approach. But not sure.Another angle: The sum can be rewritten as sum_{x in [L, R]} sum_{d | x} freq[d]. Which is the same as the original sum. So the problem becomes, for each x in [L, R], compute the sum of freq[d] where d divides x, then sum all these.But again, this approach would require for each query to iterate over all x in [L, R], which can be up to 1e6 per query. For Q=1e6, that&#39;s 1e12 again.Hmm. So how else can we compute this?Wait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible d, the prefix sum of the multiples of d. But then again, for each query, for each d, we calculate the count and multiply by freq[d], and sum all. But that&#39;s again O(1e6) per query.So that approach won&#39;t work. We need a way to compute this sum over d more efficiently.Wait, maybe using inclusion-exclusion or Möbius inversion. Alternatively, we can use a sieve-based approach to precompute for each possible d, the total frequency in the array, and then precompute a function that allows us to compute the sum over d&#39;s.Alternatively, consider that the function f(d) = freq[d], and the sum we need is sum_{d} f(d) * (floor(R/d) - floor((L-1)/d)). This is similar to a Dirichlet convolution, but I don&#39;t see an obvious way to precompute this.Wait, but maybe we can precompute for all possible d, the cumulative frequency multiplied by the number of times they contribute to certain ranges. But how?Alternatively, note that for a fixed query, the terms in the sum can be grouped based on the value of d. For example, for d&#39;s that are larger than R, the term is zero. So for each query, the relevant d&#39;s are up to R. But R can be up to 1e6-1 (since N is up to 1e6). So again, for each query, that&#39;s up to 1e6 operations.Hmm.Let me think of the constraints. Let&#39;s see:N can be up to 1e6, and K up to 1e6. So the X_j&#39;s can be up to N-1 (since X_i &lt; N). So the maximum possible d is N-1.So for each query, L and R are between 0 and N-1.So the problem is to compute sum_{d=1}^{N-1} (freq[d] * (count of multiples of d in [L, R])).But even for N=1e6, and Q=1e6, this would be O(N*Q) = 1e12 operations, which is way too slow.So this approach is not feasible. So we need a smarter way.Alternative idea: For each d, precompute the sum of freq[d] * (floor(R/d) - floor((L-1)/d)), but how?Wait, perhaps precompute for each d, the number of queries that include a particular multiple. But that also seems unclear.Alternatively, note that the function floor(R/d) can be calculated for all d in O(sqrt(R)) time by grouping the values of d where floor(R/d) is the same. This is a common optimization technique in number theory problems.So, perhaps for each query, we can iterate over all possible values of q where q is floor(R/d) or floor((L-1)/d), and compute the sum efficiently by grouping divisors into ranges that contribute the same amount.But how to do this?Let me think. Let&#39;s consider that for a given d, the term is f = freq[d] * (floor(R/d) - floor((L-1)/d)). To compute the sum over d, we can split into two parts: sum (freq[d] * floor(R/d)) and subtract sum (freq[d] * floor((L-1)/d)).So the problem reduces to computing two sums: sum_{d=1}^max_d freq[d] * floor(n/d), where n is R and (L-1) respectively.So if we can compute for a given n, the sum over d of freq[d] * floor(n/d), then for each query, the answer is sum(R) - sum(L-1).So the key is to precompute a function S(n) = sum_{d=1}^max_d (freq[d] * floor(n/d)).If we can compute S(n) quickly for any n (like O(1) or O(sqrt(n)) per query), then each query can be answered in O(1) or O(sqrt(n)) time.So the problem now is: how to compute S(n) efficiently.Let&#39;s think about S(n) = sum_{d=1}^max_d (freq[d] * floor(n/d)).This is the sum over d of freq[d] multiplied by the number of multiples of d up to n.So for a given n, S(n) is the sum we need for that n.But how to compute S(n) quickly?The approach here is to precompute for all possible n, S(n). But n can be up to 1e6 (since N is up to 1e6). So precomputing S(n) for all n up to 1e6 is possible. Let&#39;s see.If we precompute an array S where S[n] is the sum for that n, then each query can be answered as S[R] - S[L-1].But how to compute S[n] for all n from 0 to N-1?Let&#39;s see. For each d in the frequency array, and for each multiple m of d (i.e., m = k*d), we add freq[d] to S[m], S[m+1], ..., S[m + (d-1)]. Because floor(m/d) = k, and for all numbers from m to m + d -1, floor(x/d) is k. So for each d, the contribution to S[x] for x in [k*d, (k+1)*d -1] is freq[d] * k.But this seems like it&#39;s O(N log N) time. Because for each d, we have to process O(N/d) intervals, each contributing O(d) operations. Summing over d from 1 to N, the total is O(N log N), which for N=1e6 would be around 1e7 operations (since log 1e6 is around 13.8). That&#39;s manageable.Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the contribution for each d as follows:The contribution of d to S(n) is equal to sum_{k=1 to floor(n/d)} (number of times k appears in the sum for n). For a particular d, the total contribution is freq[d] multiplied by the sum of k from 1 to floor(n/d). Wait, no. Because for each k, the number of n&#39;s where floor(n/d) &gt;=k is ... Wait, maybe not.Wait, no. For a particular d, the term for a given n is floor(n/d). So for each d, the contribution to S(n) is freq[d] * floor(n/d). So for all n, the contribution of d is freq[d] multiplied by the number of multiples of d up to n.But how to compute S(n) for all n efficiently.Hmm. Let&#39;s think of it as for each d, and for each k (from 1 to max_k where k*d &lt;= N), the contribution of d to the interval [k*d, min((k+1)*d -1, N)] is freq[d] * k.So for each d, we can iterate over k from 1 to floor(N/d), and for each k, add freq[d] *k to the range [k*d, min((k+1)*d -1, N-1)].But how to do this efficiently. Because if we can perform this for each d, and then for each n, sum all the contributions from all d&#39;s.This sounds like a range update problem where for each d and k, we add a certain value to a range of n&#39;s.But performing this for each d and k would be O(K), but K can be up to 1e6, and for each d, the number of k&#39;s is up to N/d. So for d=1, we have O(N) ranges, which is 1e6 operations. For d=2, O(5e5), etc. The total sum is O(N log N), which is acceptable.But how to do this efficiently with range updates. The standard way to do multiple range updates and then compute the prefix sums is to use a difference array.So here&#39;s the plan:1. Initialize an array delta of size N+2 (since n can be up to N-1) with all zeros.2. For each d in the frequency array (each unique d with count freq[d]):   a. For k in 1, 2, ... up to floor( (N-1)/d ):      i. The start of the interval is s = k*d.      ii. The end of the interval is e = min( (k+1)*d -1, N-1 ).      iii. The contribution to this interval is val = freq[d] * k.      iv. Add val to delta[s], subtract val from delta[e+1].3. After processing all d and k, compute the prefix sum of delta to get an array contrib, where contrib[n] is the sum of all contributions up to n.   So S[n] = contrib[0] + contrib[1] + ... + contrib[n].   Wait, no. Because delta is the difference array. So we need to compute the prefix sum of delta to get the contrib array. Then S[n] is the sum of contrib[0..n].   Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.   The delta array is built such that for each range [s, e], we do delta[s] += val and delta[e+1] -= val. Then, when we compute the prefix sum of delta, we get an array where each position i has the sum of all vals that affect i. So the cumulative sum up to i is the total contribution added to S[i].   Wait, no. Because for each n, S(n) is the sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d). So for each d, floor(n/d) is the number of times d contributes to n. So for each d, the contribution to S(n) is freq[d] multiplied by the sum of k for each interval [k*d, (k+1)*d) that n is part of.   So for each interval [k*d, (k+1)*d), every n in this interval contributes k * freq[d] to S(n).   So for the entire interval [s, e], we need to add k * freq[d] to each n in [s, e]. Using a difference array, we can do this efficiently.   So for each interval s to e, add val = k * freq[d] to the delta array:   delta[s] += val;   delta[e+1] -= val;   Then, after processing all intervals, compute the prefix sum of delta to get the contrib array. The contrib array will then have contrib[i] = sum of all val&#39;s that affect i. Then, the S(n) is the prefix sum up to n of the contrib array.   Wait, no. Because for each i, contrib[i] is the sum of all val&#39;s added for intervals that include i. So S(n) is the sum of contrib[0] to contrib[n]. So to compute S(n), we need a prefix sum array of the contrib array.   So here&#39;s the plan:   - Initialize delta as a zero array of size N+2.   - For each d in freq:      - For k from 1 to max_k where k*d &lt;= N-1:          s = k*d          e = min( (k+1)*d -1, N-1 )          val = freq[d] * k          delta[s] += val          if e+1 &lt; N:              delta[e+1] -= val   - Then, compute the contrib array by computing the prefix sum of delta. So contrib[i] = delta[0] + delta[1] + ... + delta[i]   Wait, no. The prefix sum of delta gives the contrib array. Because for each i, contrib[i] is the sum of all the deltas up to i. So after the prefix sum, contrib[i] is the value added to all positions starting at i. Wait, no. The delta array is a difference array. So when you compute the prefix sum, you get the array of values added to each position.   For example, if you have a delta array where delta[s] += val and delta[e+1] -= val, then when you compute the prefix sum up to i, each i in [s, e] will have the val added once. So the prefix sum gives the contrib array, where contrib[i] is the total value added to i.   Then, the S(n) is the sum of contrib[0] + contrib[1] + ... + contrib[n].   So after computing the contrib array, we can compute a prefix sum array of contrib, say prefix, where prefix[n] is the sum of contrib[0..n]. Then, for a query [L, R], the answer is prefix[R] - (prefix[L-1] if L&gt;0 else 0).   So the steps are:   1. Count the frequency of each X_j in the input, store as a freq dictionary.   2. Initialize delta array of size N+2 (since N can be up to 1e6, but indexes go up to N-1). So delta is of size N+1 perhaps.   3. For each d in freq:      a. For k from 1 to floor( (N-1)/d ):          s = k * d          e = min( (k+1)*d -1, N-1 )          val = freq[d] * k          delta[s] += val          if e+1 &lt;= N-1:              delta[e+1] -= val   4. Compute the contrib array by taking the prefix sum of delta. contrib[i] = delta[0] + ... + delta[i]   5. Compute the prefix sum array of contrib, call it prefix, where prefix[i] = contrib[0] + ... + contrib[i]   6. For each query [L, R], the answer is prefix[R] - (prefix[L-1] if L &gt;0 else 0)   Now, let&#39;s check the sample input.   Sample Input 1:   10 4   1 1 2 1   So the frequencies are:   1: 3   2: 1   So for d=1:      For k=1: s=1*1=1, e= min(2-1,9) =1. So interval is [1,1]. Val=3*1=3.      Then k=2: s=2, e=2. Val=3*2=6.      ... up to k=9 (since 9*1=9 &lt;=9).      For each k from 1 to 9:          s=k*1, e =k+1-1= k.          val=3*k.          So delta[k] +=3k, delta[k+1] -=3k.      So for all k in 1-9:          delta[k] +=3k          delta[k+1] -=3k      So the delta after processing d=1 will have:      For k=1: delta[1] +=3, delta[2] -=3.      k=2: delta[2] +=6, delta[3] -=6.      etc. up to k=9: delta[9] +=27, delta[10] -=27.      But since N=10, the array indices are 0-9. So delta has size 10+2=12? Or maybe N is 10, and delta has size 10+1=11 (indices 0-10).      Then for d=2:          k can be up to 9//2=4 (since 4*2=8 &lt;=9).          k=1: s=2, e=3-1=3. So interval 2-3. Val=1*1=1.              delta[2] +=1, delta[4] -=1.          k=2: s=4, e=5. interval 4-5. Val=2*1=2.              delta[4] +=2, delta[6] -=2.          k=3: s=6, e=7. Val=3.              delta[6] +=3, delta[8] -=3.          k=4: s=8, e=9. Val=4.              delta[8] +=4, delta[10] -=4.      So after processing d=2, the delta array will have:      For k=1: add 1 to delta[2], subtract from delta[4].      And so on.      Then, when we compute the contrib array (the prefix sum of delta), and then the prefix sum of contrib, that gives the sum S(n) up to n.      For example, in the first sample, the sum from 0 to 9 is 35. Let&#39;s see:      For each element in 0-9:          The count is the number of X_j&#39;s that divide it.          For X_j&#39;s [1,1,2,1], so for each i:              i=0: divisors in X_j&#39;s are X_j&#39;s that divide 0. But in the code, X_j can be 1, which divides 0 (since 0 mod 1 is 0). Wait, but wait, in the code, the procedure starts with i=0 and increments by jump. So for X_j=1, the code adds 1 to all indices divisible by 1. That includes all indices. So for X_j=1, all elements from 0 to N-1 are incremented by 1. So in the sample input, since X_j=1 is called 3 times, each element is incremented by 3. Additionally, X_j=2 is called once, so elements 0, 2,4,6,8 are incremented once.          Wait, but according to the code, the procedure starts with i=0, then adds jump. So for jump=1, i starts at 0, then 0+1=1, 1+1=2, etc. So all elements from 0 to N-1 are added 1 each time the function is called with jump=1. So for X_j=1, the code adds 1 to every element. So in the first sample, since X_j=1 is used 3 times, each element in the array is increased by 3. X_j=2 is used once, so elements 0,2,4,6,8 are increased by 1 (since i starts at 0, then 0+2=2, 2+2=4, etc.). So the final array is:          seq[0] = 3 (from X=1) + 1 (from X=2) =4          seq[1] =3 (from X=1)           seq[2] =3+1=4          seq[3] =3          seq[4] =3+1=4          seq[5] =3          seq[6] =3+1=4          seq[7] =3          seq[8] =3+1=4          seq[9] =3          Sum of 0-9 is 4 +3+4+3+4+3+4+3+4+3 = 4*5 (for even indices) + 3*5 (for odd indices) = 20+15=35. Which matches sample output 1.          So according to our approach:          For d=1, freq[d]=3.          For each k from 1 to 9 (since N-1=9):              s =k*1=k, e = (k+1)*1-1 =k. So the interval is [k, k].              val=3*k.              So delta[k] +=3k, delta[k+1] -=3k.          So for example, k=1: delta[1] +=3, delta[2] -=3.          After processing all k for d=1, the delta array for positions 1 to 9:          Each position k (from 1 to 9) has delta[k] +=3k, and delta[k+1] -=3k.          Then for d=2, freq[d]=1:              k=1: s=2, e=3-1=3. So interval [2,3]. val=1*1=1.              So delta[2] +=1, delta[4] -=1.              k=2: s=4, e=5. val=2. delta[4] +=2, delta[6] -=2.              k=3: s=6, e=7. val=3. delta[6] +=3, delta[8] -=3.              k=4: s=8, e=9. val=4. delta[8] +=4, delta[10] -=4.              So delta[8] gets 4, and since delta[10] is beyond N-1=9, we don&#39;t process it.          So after building delta, we compute the contrib array as the prefix sum of delta.          Then the contrib array for each index is the sum of delta up to that index.          Then, the prefix sum of contrib gives S(n), the sum up to n.          For example, for n=9, S(9) should be the sum of all elements from 0 to 9.          Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s compute delta for the first sample.          delta is initialized to 0.          For d=1:              k ranges from 1 to 9.              For each k:                  delta[k] +=3k                  delta[k+1] -=3k              So after processing all k for d=1, delta is:              delta[1] =3*1 =3              delta[2] =3*2 -3*1 =6-3=3?              Wait no. For each k, we add 3k to delta[k], and subtract 3k from delta[k+1].              So for k=1: delta[1] +=3, delta[2] -=3.              k=2: delta[2] +=6, delta[3] -=6.              k=3: delta[3] +=9, delta[4] -=9.              and so on.              So the delta array after processing d=1 would be:              delta[1] =3              delta[2] =6 -3 =3 (from k=1: subtract3, then k=2 add6, so delta[2] is 3)              delta[3] =9 -6=3 (from k=2 subtract6, then k=3 add9, delta[3] becomes 3)              Wait no. Because each k&#39;s processing adds and subtracts.              Let&#39;s see:              Initial delta is all zeros.              For k=1:                  delta[1] +=3                  delta[2] -=3              For k=2:                  delta[2] +=6                  delta[3] -=6              For k=3:                  delta[3] +=9                  delta[4] -=9              ... up to k=9:                  delta[9] +=27                  delta[10] -=27.              So after processing all k for d=1, delta will have:              delta[1] =3              delta[2] =6-3 =3 (since for k=1, delta[2] is -3, then for k=2, delta[2] +=6 → 3)              delta[3] =9-6=3 (k=2 subtract6, then k=3 add9 → delta[3] is 3)              Similarly, delta[4] =12-9=3, etc.              So for delta[1..9], each is 3, and delta[10] is -27.              Then for d=2:                  For k=1:                      delta[2] +=1 → delta[2] becomes 3+1=4                      delta[4] -=1 → delta[4] becomes 3-1=2 (since after d=1 processing, delta[4] was 3 (from delta[4] being 3 from d=1&#39;s processing for k=4?), but wait, perhaps this is getting confusing.              Wait, perhaps the delta array after processing d=1 has:              For i=1: delta[i] is 3 (from k=1)              i=2: after k=1, delta[2] is -3. Then k=2 adds 6 to delta[2], so delta[2] becomes -3+6=3.              i=3: after k=2 subtracts6 (delta[3] is -6), then k=3 adds9 → delta[3] becomes 3.              Similarly, delta[4] would be -9 (from k=3&#39;s subtract) then k=4 adds12 → 3.              So after d=1 processing, all delta[i] from 1 to 9 are 3, and delta[10] is -27.              Then processing d=2:              k=1: s=2, e=3. val=1.              So delta[2] +=1 → becomes 3+1=4.              delta[4] -=1 → becomes 3-1=2.              k=2: s=4, e=5. val=2.              delta[4] +=2 → 2+2=4.              delta[6] -=2 → 3-2=1.              k=3: s=6, e=7. val=3.              delta[6] +=3 → 1+3=4.              delta[8] -=3 → 3-3=0.              k=4: s=8, e=9. val=4.              delta[8] +=4 → 0+4=4.              delta[10] -=4 → -27-4=-31.              So after processing d=2, delta becomes:              delta[2] =4              delta[4] =4 (from 3-1+2)              delta[6] =4 (3-2+3)              delta[8] =4 (3-3+4)              Other positions:              delta[1]=3              delta[3]=3              delta[5]=3              delta[7]=3              delta[9]=3              delta[10]=-31.              Now, when we compute the contrib array (prefix sum of delta), the contrib array is:              contrib[0] =0.              contrib[1] =delta[0] + delta[1] =0 +3=3.              contrib[2] =3 +4=7.              contrib[3] =7 +3=10.              contrib[4] =10 +4=14.              contrib[5] =14 +3=17.              contrib[6] =17 +4=21.              contrib[7] =21 +3=24.              contrib[8] =24 +4=28.              contrib[9] =28 +3=31.              contrib[10] =31 + (-31) =0.              Then the prefix sum array (prefix) is the cumulative sum of contrib:              prefix[0] = contrib[0] =0.              prefix[1] =0+3=3.              prefix[2] =3+7=10.              prefix[3] =10+10=20.              prefix[4] =20+14=34.              prefix[5] =34+17=51.              prefix[6] =51+21=72.              prefix[7] =72+24=96.              prefix[8] =96+28=124.              prefix[9] =124+31=155.              prefix[10] =155+0=155.              So for query 0-9, the answer is prefix[9] - prefix[-1] (but L is 0, so prefix[9] -0=155. Wait, but according to the sample input, the sum is 35. So something is wrong here.              Wait, this indicates that our approach is incorrect. Because according to this calculation, S(9) would be 155, which is way larger than the sample&#39;s 35.              So where is the mistake?              Let me re-examine the approach.              The S(n) is the sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d). For the first sample, n=9.              For d=1, freq[d]=3. floor(9/1)=9. Contribution 3*9=27.              For d=2, freq[d]=1. floor(9/2)=4. Contribution 1*4=4.              Total sum is 27+4=31. Which is S(9)=31. But the sample&#39;s sum is 35. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests a problem in the approach.              Wait, wait. In the first sample, each element from 0 to9 is added 3 times for d=1 (since X=1 is called 3 times). So for i=0, the number of divisors in X_j is 3 (for X=1) +1 (for X=2) if 2 divides 0.              Wait, wait. The code calls the function with X_j, which adds 1 to all multiples of X_j. So for X=1, it adds 1 to all indices 0,1,2,...,9. Each time the function is called with X=1, so that&#39;s 3 times. So each element is increased by 3. Then X=2 is called once, so elements 0,2,4,6,8 are increased by 1. So each element&#39;s value is 3 + (1 if even index and X=2 is called once). So the total sum is:              10 elements *3 =30, plus 5 elements (even indices) *1 =5 → total 35.              But according to S(n) = sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d). For n=9:              d=1: 3 *9=27.              d=2: 1*4=4.              Sum is 31. But 35-31=4. So where is this missing 4?              Ah! Because the code starts at i=0. So for X_j=2, the indices are 0,2,4,6,8. So the count of multiples of X_j=2 in 0-9 is 5 (0,2,4,6,8). So floor(9/2) =4, but 0 is also a multiple. So our formula S(n) is missing the zero case.              Oh! Because in the code, when X_j is the jump, i starts at 0 and adds X_j each time. So the indices are 0, X_j, 2*X_j, etc., as long as i &lt;N. So for X_j=2 and N=10, the indices are 0,2,4,6,8. So the count is 5. But floor(9/2) is 4. So the count is 4+1 (for 0) =5.              So our approach is missing the count of zero. Because when X_j divides i=0, which is allowed (0 mod X_j is 0). So for any X_j, the code adds 1 to 0. So for d=X_j, the number of multiples in [0, n] is 1 + floor(n/d). So the number of multiples is floor(n/d) +1 if d &lt;=n. Wait no: for d=2, 0 is included. So for X_j=2, the number of multiples up to n is (n //d) +1 if n &gt;=0. Because 0 is considered.              So in the code&#39;s process, for a jump X_j, the multiples are 0, X_j, 2X_j, ... until i &lt;N. So the count is (N-1) // X_j +1. Because the maximum i is (k) X_j where k X_j &lt;N. So k_max = (N-1) // X_j. So the count is k_max +1.              So in the problem statement, when we have a query [L, R], the count of multiples of d in that range is the number of multiples of d in [0, R] minus the number of multiples of d in [0, L-1]. But in the code&#39;s procedure, the multiples include 0, so for a given X_j, the count in [0, R] is floor(R/d) +1 if d &lt;= R, but only if 0 &lt;=R.              Wait, no. Wait, for example, d=2 and R=9. The multiples are 0,2,4,6,8 → 5 elements. R=9, so 9//2=4, but 4+1=5. Which matches.              So for a given d, the count of multiples in [0, R] is (R //d) +1. Because 0 is counted as a multiple. So the formula is correct.              But in the code&#39;s procedure, the code adds 1 to all indices divisible by X_j, which are 0, X_j, 2X_j, etc., as long as i &lt;N. So the count of elements is (N-1)//X_j +1. Because for i &lt;N, the maximum k is floor( (N-1)/X_j ), so the count is k+1.              So for the code&#39;s procedure, when X_j is used, the number of elements added is (N-1)//X_j +1.              But in the problem statement, when we process a query [L, R], the sum is the sum of all X_j&#39;s count of multiples in [L, R]. So for X_j, the count is the number of multiples of X_j in [L, R].              But in the code&#39;s procedure, the count for X_j is the number of multiples of X_j in [0, R] minus the number of multiples of X_j in [0, L-1]. But since the code&#39;s procedure includes 0, the count should be (R // X_j +1) - ((L-1) // X_j +1) if L&gt;0, else (R // X_j +1). So the formula becomes (R//X_j +1) - ((L-1)//X_j +1) = (R//X_j - (L-1)//X_j).              Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:              For X_j, the count of multiples in [0, R] is (R // X_j) +1. Because 0 is counted. For example, X_j=2, R=3: multiples are 0,2 → R//2=1 → 1+1=2. Correct.              Similarly, for R=1, X_j=2: multiples are 0 → R//2=0 → 0+1=1. Correct.              So for the interval [L, R], the count is (R // X_j +1) - ((L-1) // X_j +1) = (R//X_j - (L-1)//X_j).              So the formula for the count is floor(R/X_j) - floor( (L-1)/X_j ).              Which is the same as our previous approach. So why the discrepancy in the sample?              Let&#39;s re-calculate the sample with this formula.              Sample Input 1:              X_j&#39;s are [1,1,2,1]. So freq[1]=3, freq[2]=1.              Query 0-9:              For d=1: count is (9//1) - (-1//1) =9 - (-1) =10. So 3 *10=30.              For d=2: count is (9//2) - (-1//2) =4 - (-1) =5 → 1*5=5.              Total 30+5=35. Which matches the sample.              Oh! So the mistake in our earlier approach was that when calculating S(n) = sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d), we are missing the +1 for 0.              So the formula for the count of multiples of d in [0, R] is (R//d) +1. So for a query [L, R], the count is (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) = R//d - (L-1)//d.              But the formula we used in the approach is sum_{d} freq[d] * (floor(R/d) - floor( (L-1)/d )) → which is correct.              So why in the sample calculation for S(9) using our approach it gives 31?              Because in our approach, S(9) is the sum for each d of freq[d] * floor(9/d), which for d=1 is 9*3=27, d=2 is 4*1=4, sum 31. But according to the query 0-9, the correct sum is 35. So this indicates that our approach is wrong.              Ah! Because our approach computes S(n) as sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d), but the correct count for each d is (floor(n/d) +1) if we include 0. So the correct formula should be sum_{d} freq[d] * (floor(n/d) +1) when n &gt;=0.              So we have a mistake in the initial analysis. The correct count of multiples in [0, R] is (R//d) +1. Therefore, for a query [L, R], the count is (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) = (R//d - (L-1)//d).              So the formula for the query is sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) ) = sum_{d} freq[d] * ( R//d - (L-1)//d ), which is the same as the initial formula.              But in the code&#39;s procedure, the sum for the entire array (0 to 9) is sum_{d} freq[d] * (9//d +1).              For d=1: 9//1 +1 =9+1=10 → 3*10=30.              For d=2: 9//2 +1=4+1=5 →1*5=5.              Sum 35.              So why in our approach&#39;s S(n), which is sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d), gives 31 for n=9?              Because in our approach, the sum is missing the +1 term. So the initial approach is wrong. Therefore, our entire approach is incorrect.              So what&#39;s the problem here?              The correct formula for a query [L, R] is sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) ) → sum_{d} freq[d] * ( R//d - (L-1)//d ).              But this is the same as the initial approach. So why the discrepancy in the sample?              Because the initial approach computes S(n) as sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d). But according to this, for the entire query [0,9], the sum would be S(9) - S(-1). But S(-1) is zero, so the sum is S(9), which according to the approach is 31. But the correct answer is 35.              So there&#39;s a mistake in how S(n) is defined. The correct S(n) should be sum_{d} freq[d] * (floor(n/d) +1), not floor(n/d). Because in the code&#39;s procedure, the multiples are counted from 0. So for a query [0, R], the count is (R//d) +1.              So the correct formula for a query [L, R] is sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) ) → which equals sum_{d} freq[d] * ( R//d - (L-1)//d ).              But the initial approach uses S(n) = sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d), and the query answer is S(R) - S(L-1).              Which would give sum_{d} freq[d] * ( floor(R/d) - floor( (L-1)/d ) ).              But according to the correct formula, the answer is sum_{d} freq[d} * ( R//d - (L-1)//d ), which is the same as the initial approach.              So why in the sample, the initial approach&#39;s calculation gives 31 instead of 35?              Because in the sample, the sum for the query [0,9] is S(9) - S(-1) =31 - 0=31, which is wrong. So there&#39;s a mistake in how S(n) is defined.              The mistake is that the code&#39;s procedure includes 0 in the multiples. So when X_j is called, the code adds 1 to 0. So for a query [0, R], the count is (R // X_j) +1. But according to the initial approach&#39;s S(n), which is sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d), for n=9 and d=1, this is 9, but the correct count is 10 (9+1). So the initial approach is missing this +1.              So the error is that the formula used in the approach is incorrect. The correct formula for the count of multiples of d in [0, n] is (n//d) +1, not floor(n/d) =n//d.              Therefore, the correct formula for the sum is sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) ), which simplifies to sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R//d - (L-1)//d) ).              But this is the same as the initial approach&#39;s formula. So why is there a discrepancy in the sample?              Because in the initial approach, the code computes S(n) = sum_{d} freq[d] * floor(n/d), but the correct S(n) should be sum_{d} freq[d} * (n//d +1).              So the initial approach is missing the +1 for each d. So the entire approach is wrong.              So the mistake is that the code&#39;s procedure includes 0, which is counted as a multiple. So the number of multiples in [0, R] is (R //d) +1, not (R//d).              So the correct formula for the sum is:              sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R //d +1) - ((L-1) //d +1) )               = sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R //d - (L-1) //d) )              So the initial approach&#39;s formula is correct. But why in the sample calculation using the initial approach&#39;s formula, the result is 31 instead of 35?              Because the code&#39;s procedure includes 0, which is part of the array. So in the initial approach&#39;s sample calculation for d=1, the count for query [0,9] is 9//1 =9, so 3*9=27. But according to the correct formula, it&#39;s (9//1 +1) =10 → 3*10=30.              So the initial approach&#39;s formula is missing the +1. So the entire approach is wrong.              So where is the mistake in the initial approach?              Ah! The problem is that the code&#39;s procedure starts with i=0. So for X_j, the count of multiples in the array is ( (N-1) // X_j ) +1. But when we are answering the query [L, R], which is between 0 and N-1, the count of multiples in [L, R] is (R // X_j +1) - ( (L-1) // X_j +1 ) = R // X_j - (L-1) // X_j.              So for the sample query [0,9], the count for d=1 is (9//1) +1 - ( (0-1) //1 +1 ) = (9+1) - ( -1 +1 ) =10 -0=10. So 3*10=30.              For d=2: (9//2 +1) - ( (-1//2) +1 ) =4+1 - ( -1 +1 )=5 -0=5 → 1*5=5. Total 35.              So the correct formula is to compute for each query [L, R] the sum over d of freq[d] * ( (R//d +1) - ( (L-1)//d +1 ) ).              Which simplifies to sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R//d - (L-1)//d ) ).              So the formula is correct. But the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d), which is missing the +1.              So why is this?              Because the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is defined as the sum of freq[d] * floor(n/d), but according to the problem statement, the correct count for a query [0, R] is sum_{d} freq[d} * (R//d +1). So the initial approach is missing the +1.              So this indicates that the initial approach is incorrect. So the problem requires us to include the +1 term for each d.              Therefore, the correct way to compute the query is to calculate for each query [L, R] the sum:              sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R //d +1) - ( (L-1) //d +1 ) )              Which simplifies to sum_{d} freq[d] * ( (R //d - (L-1) //d) )              So the initial approach&#39;s formula is correct. So why in the sample calculation using the initial approach&#39;s formula, the sum was 31 instead of 35?              Because the initial approach&#39;s delta array was built for terms of freq[d] *k, where k is the floor(n/d) term. But according to the code&#39;s procedure, the count is (n//d +1), so the sum for S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * (n//d +1).              So the correct S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * (n//d +1), and the query answer is S(R) - S(L-1).              But the initial approach&#39;s S(n) was sum_{d} freq[d} * (n//d). So the delta array in the initial approach is built for the wrong term.              So to correct this, the approach needs to be modified to account for the +1.              So the correct way to compute S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * (n//d +1).              Then, the query answer is S(R) - S(L-1).              So how to compute S(n) = sum_{d} freq[d} * (n//d +1) for all n up to N-1.              But how?              Let&#39;s think of S(n) as sum_{d} freq[d] * (n//d + 1) = sum_{d} freq[d] * (n//d) + sum_{d} freq[d].              The second term is sum_{d} freq[d] = K, the total number of calls. Because each X_j is counted once in freq[d]. So sum_{d} freq[d} = K.              So S(n) can be written as (sum_{d} freq[d] * (n//d)) ) + K.              So for the query [L, R], the answer is S(R) - S(L-1) = [sum_{d} (R//d) * freq[d} + K] - [sum_{d} ( (L-1)//d ) * freq[d} + K] ] = sum_{d} freq[d} * (R//d - (L-1)//d) ), which matches the correct formula.              So the initial approach&#39;s mistake was not including the +1 term. But since S(n) is sum_{d} (n//d +1) * freq[d} = sum_{d} freq[d} * n//d + K, then the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * n//d, and the correct answer is (initial S(n) + K) - (initial S(L-1) + K) ) = initial S(n) - initial S(L-1). So the initial approach&#39;s formula is correct because the K terms cancel out.              So this is why the initial approach&#39;s formula is correct. The +1 terms are accounted for by including K in the S(n) computation, but since they cancel out when computing the difference S(R) - S(L-1), the initial approach&#39;s formula works.              So why does the sample calculation with the initial approach give 31 for S(9) but the correct answer is 35?              Because in the sample, K=4 (since there are 4 X_j&#39;s: 1,1,2,1). So S(n) according to the initial approach is 31 (sum of 3*9 +1*4=31), then adding K=4 gives 35. So the correct answer is 31 +4 =35.              But in the initial approach&#39;s formula, the answer is S(R) - S(L-1) =31 -0=31, which is wrong. So there&#39;s a mistake.              So the error is that the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d), but the correct S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d) + K.              So when we compute the answer as S(R) - S(L-1), we&#39;re missing the K term.              Therefore, the correct formula for the answer is (sum_{d} freq[d} * (R//d) ) + K ) - ( sum_{d} freq[d} * ((L-1)//d) ) + K ) → which is sum_{d} freq[d} * (R//d - (L-1)//d) ), which is the same as before.              But how to reconcile this with the initial approach&#39;s calculations?              Because in the initial approach&#39;s S(n), the answer is sum_{d} freq[d} * (R//d - (L-1)//d ), which is correct, but in the sample calculation, the initial approach&#39;s method gives 31, which is 35-4=31. So the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is missing the K term.              So there must be a mistake in how the delta array is built.              Let me re-examine the sample input again.              In the initial approach&#39;s delta array for the sample:              The contrib array for each n is the sum of freq[d} * floor(n/d).              So for n=9, the contrib array&#39;s prefix sum (prefix[9]) is 31. But the correct sum is 35.              The K is 4, which is not added in the initial approach&#39;s S(n). So the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d), and the correct answer requires sum_{d} freq[d} * (floor(n/d) +1) = initial S(n) + K.              So the correct answer for the query [0,9] is initial S(9) + K =31 +4=35.              So the mistake is that the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is missing the K term, which is the sum of all freq[d} (since K=sum_{d} freq[d}).              So the correct answer for query [L, R] is (S(R) + K) - (S(L-1) + K) ) = S(R) - S(L-1) + (K - K) ) = S(R) - S(L-1). But this contradicts with the sample.              This is confusing. Let&#39;s re-calculate.              For query [L, R], the answer is sum_{d} freq[d} * ( (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) ) → which is sum_{d} freq[d} * ( R//d - (L-1)//d ).              So this is the same as (sum_{d} freq[d} * R//d ) - sum_{d} freq[d} * (L-1)//d ) → S(R) - S(L-1), where S(n) is sum_{d} freq[d} * n//d.              So according to this, the initial approach&#39;s answer is correct. But in the sample, the initial approach&#39;s calculation gives S(R) =31 (3*9 +1*4=31), and the correct answer is 35. So where is this discrepancy?              Because the initial approach&#39;s S(R) is sum_{d} freq[d} * R//d.              For sample R=9:              d=1: R//d=9 → 3*9=27.              d=2: R//d=4 → 1*4=4.              sum=27+4=31.              But according to the problem statement, the correct sum is 35. Which suggests that the formula is missing something.              But according to the code&#39;s procedure, for each X_j, the count of multiples in [0, R] is R//X_j +1.              So the sum for query [0, R] is sum_{d} freq[d} * (R//d +1).              Which equals sum_{d} freq[d} * R//d + sum_{d} freq[d} = S(R) + K.              So the initial approach&#39;s formula for query [0, R] is S(R) - S(-1) = S(R) -0 = S(R) =31. But the correct answer is S(R) + K=31+4=35.              So the initial approach&#39;s formula is incorrect for cases where L=0.              Because when L=0, the query is [0, R], and the count is (R//d +1) - 0, since (L-1) is -1. So for (L-1) =-1, (L-1)//d is -1//d, which for positive d is -1. For example, -1//2 is -1. So (R//d +1) - (-1//d +1) = (R//d +1) - ( -1//d +1) = R//d +1 - ( (-1 //d) +1 ).              For d=2, (-1//2) is -1. So (R//d +1) - ( (-1//d) +1 ) =4+1 - ( -1 +1 )=5-0=5.              For d=1, (-1//1) is -1. So (9+1) - (-1+1)=10-0=10.              So the formula works. But the initial approach&#39;s formula computes this as S(R) - S(L-1) = S(9) - S(-1).              S(-1) is sum_{d} freq[d} * (-1//d). For d=1, -1//1 is -1. So sum for d=1 is 3*(-1) =-3. For d=2, (-1//2) =-1. So sum is 1*(-1) =-1. S(-1) is -3-1=-4. So S(9) - S(-1) is 31 - (-4) =35. Which is correct.              Ah! So the initial approach&#39;s formula is correct. But in our earlier calculation, we did not compute S(L-1) for L=0. So the mistake was in assuming that S(L-1) is zero when L=0, but in reality, when L=0, L-1 is -1, and S(-1) is sum_{d} freq[d} * (-1//d). Which for the sample input, is:              For d=1: -1//1 =-1 → 3*(-1) =-3.              For d=2: -1//2 =-1 → 1*(-1) =-1.              Sum is -4. So S(R) - S(L-1) is 31 - (-4) =35.              So the initial approach&#39;s formula is correct. The error in the earlier sample calculation was that we assumed S(L-1) is zero when L=0, but it&#39;s actually S(-1) which is -4. So the answer is 31 - (-4) =35.              So the initial approach&#39;s delta array must correctly calculate S(n) as sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d).              Therefore, the correct way to compute S(n) is to use the initial approach&#39;s method, and for each query [L, R], the answer is S(R) - S(L-1).              So now, let&#39;s re-examine the delta array for the sample input.              For the sample input, when we process d=1:              k ranges from 1 to 9 (since (N-1)=9).              For each k:                  s =k*1 =k.                  e= (k+1)*1 -1 =k.                  val=3*k.                  delta[k] +=3k.                  delta[k+1] -=3k.              So delta[1] =3, delta[2] =-3+6=3, delta[3] =-6+9=3, etc. So the delta array after processing d=1 has:              delta[1] =3              delta[2] =-3+6=3              delta[3] =-6+9=3              ... up to delta[9] =3*9 =27, delta[10] -=27.              Then for d=2:                  k ranges from 1 to 4 (since 4*2=8 &lt;=9).                  For k=1:                      s=2, e=3-1=3.                      val=1*1=1.                      delta[2] +=1 → becomes 3+1=4.                      delta[4] -=1 → becomes 3-1=2.                  For k=2:                      s=4, e=5.                      val=2*1=2.                      delta[4] +=2 → 2+2=4.                      delta[6] -=2 → 3-2=1.                  For k=3:                      s=6, e=7.                      val=3*1=3.                      delta[6] +=3 →1+3=4.                      delta[8] -=3 →3-3=0.                  For k=4:                      s=8, e=9.                      val=4*1=4.                      delta[8] +=4 →0+4=4.                      delta[10] -=4 → -27-4=-31.              So the delta array now:              delta[1] =3              delta[2] =4              delta[3] =3              delta[4] =4              delta[5] =3              delta[6] =4              delta[7] =3              delta[8] =4              delta[9] =3              delta[10] =-31.              Now, compute the contrib array as the prefix sum of delta:              contrib[0] =0              contrib[1] =3 →0+3=3.              contrib[2] =3+4=7.              contrib[3] =7+3=10.              contrib[4] =10+4=14.              contrib[5] =14+3=17.              contrib[6] =17+4=21.              contrib[7] =21+3=24.              contrib[8] =24+4=28.              contrib[9] =28+3=31.              contrib[10] =31+(-31)=0.              So the contrib array is [0,3,7,10,14,17,21,24,28,31,0].              Then, compute the prefix sum array of contrib:              prefix[0] =0.              prefix[1] =3.              prefix[2] =3+7=10.              prefix[3] =10+10=20.              prefix[4] =20+14=34.              prefix[5] =34+17=51.              prefix[6] =51+21=72.              prefix[7] =72+24=96.              prefix[8] =96+28=124.              prefix[9] =124+31=155.              prefix[10] =155+0=155.              So S(n) is the prefix sum up to n. So S(9) is 155.              But according to our formula, S(9) is sum_{d} freq[d} * 9//d.              For d=1: 3 *9=27.              d=2: 1*4=4.              sum is 27+4=31.              So why is the prefix sum 155? Because the initial approach&#39;s S(n) is the sum of contrib[0..n], which is the sum of all freq[d} * floor(x/d) for x from 0 to n.              So S(n) is prefix[n].              For example, S(9) = prefix[9] =155.              But according to the formula, S(9) is 31. So what&#39;s wrong?              This suggests a mistake in the approach. The initial approach&#39;s S(n) is not the sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d), but the sum over all x from 0 to n of sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(x/d).              So the approach is incorrect. The initial approach&#39;s method computes the sum of all elements up to x, which is the cumulative sum of the array, but the problem requires the sum for each query [L, R], which is the sum of the array elements from L to R.              Wait, no. The array elements are the sum of freq[d} for each divisor d of x. So the sum from L to R is sum_{x=L}^R sum_{d |x} freq[d}.              Which is the same as sum_{d} freq[d} * (number of multiples of d in [L, R}).              Which is the same as sum_{d} freq[d} * ( (R//d +1) - ((L-1)//d +1) ) = sum_{d} freq[d} * ( R//d - (L-1)//d ).              So the correct way to compute the sum for a query is to compute this sum for each query.              The initial approach tried to precompute S(n) as sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(n/d), but this leads to the sum for all x from 0 to n of the array&#39;s elements. But the query requires the sum from L to R, which is sum_{x=L}^R array[x], which is prefix[R] - prefix[L-1} if prefix is the prefix sum array of the array.              So the initial approach&#39;s method is incorrect. Because the delta array is built to compute the sum of the array&#39;s elements, which is exactly what the query is asking for.              So what&#39;s the mistake here?              Let&#39;s re-examine the sample.              Sample Input 1&#39;s array after processing is:              index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9              value:4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 → sum is 35.              The prefix sum array would be:              4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28, 32, 35.              So the sum from 0 to9 is35.              According to the initial approach&#39;s method, the contrib array after delta processing is the array where contrib[i] is the sum of delta[0..i], which for each i is the sum_{d} freq[d} * floor(i/d).              For i=0:              contrib[0] =0 → floor(0/d) is 0 for all d. So sum is 0.              For i=1:              floor(1/1) =1 → 3*1=3.              floor(1/2) =0 →1*0=0.              sum is3.              For i=2:              floor(2/1) =2 →3*2=6.              floor(2/2) =1 →1*1=1.              sum 6+1=7.              For i=3:              floor(3/1)=3 →3*3=9.              floor(3/2)=1 →1*1=1.              sum 10.              For i=4:              3*4=12 +1*2=2 → sum 14.              And so on. So the contrib array is [0,3,7,10,14,17,21,24,28,31,0].              The prefix sum array of this contrib array is:              [0,3,10,20,34,51,72,96,124,155,155].              So for the query 0-9, the answer is prefix[9] - prefix[-1] →155 -0=155. Which is incorrect.              This indicates that the initial approach is incorrect.              So the mistake is that the initial approach is using the wrong method to compute the sum of the array. The initial approach&#39;s method computes the sum of the array elements up to n (prefix sum), but the query requires the sum of the array elements from L to R.              So the correct way to answer the query is to compute the prefix sum array of the array (not the initial approach&#39;s method), and answer each query as prefix[R] - prefix[L-1].              But how to compute this array efficiently.              The array is seq[i] = sum_{d divides i} freq[d}.              So each element in the array is the sum of the frequencies of all its divisors.              So the problem reduces to, given a list of X_j&#39;s, compute for each i the number of divisors of i in the list X_j&#39;s.              Then, for each query [L, R], sum the values from L to R.              The challenge is to compute this array efficiently.              For N up to 1e6, we can compute this array using a sieve-like approach.              Here&#39;s the plan:              1. Count the frequency of each X_j.              2. For each d in the frequency array, add freq[d] to all multiples of d.              For example, for d=1, add 3 to all multiples of 1 (which is all elements).              For d=2, add 1 to all multiples of 2.              So the array can be computed in O(K + N log N) time.              Once the array is computed, compute the prefix sum array.              Then, each query can be answered in O(1) time.              Let&#39;s try this approach for the sample input.              Sample Input 1:              N=10, K=4, X_j&#39;s [1,1,2,1].              freq[1]=3, freq[2]=1.              Initialize array as zeros.              For d=1: add 3 to all multiples of 1 → every element from 0 to9.              For d=2: add 1 to multiples of 2 →0,2,4,6,8.              So the array is:              index 0:3+1=4              index1:3.              index2:3+1=4.              and so on.              The array is as before, sum is35.              The prefix sum array is:              [4,7,11,14,18,21,25,28,32,35].              So for query 0-9, the answer is35.              For query 2-6: elements are4,3,4,3,4. Sum 4+3+4+3+4=18.              For query7-7: sum3.              Which matches the sample.              So this approach is correct and efficient.              The sieve approach:              Initialize an array ans of size N with zeros.              For each d in freq:                  for multiple in 0, d, 2d, ... &lt;N:                      ans[multiple] += freq[d]              Then compute prefix sums.              For each query [L, R], answer is prefix[R] - (prefix[L-1] if L&gt;0 else 0).              But this approach is O(K + sum_{d} N/d ), which for N=1e6 and K=1e6 could be O(N log N), which is acceptable.              For example, for d=1, it&#39;s O(N). For d=2, O(N/2), etc. The total sum is O(N log N), which is acceptable for N=1e6.              So this approach is feasible.              So the correct approach is:              - Compute the frequency array.              - Initialize an array ans of size N with zeros.              - For each d in freq:                  for multiple in 0, d, 2d, ... up to N-1:                      ans[multiple] += freq[d]              - Compute the prefix sum array of ans.              - For each query, compute prefix[R] - prefix[L-1] (if L&gt;0).              This approach is correct and efficient.              The sieve-based approach is O(N log N), which for N=1e6 is about 1e7 operations, which is manageable.              So why did the initial approach fail?              Because the initial approach tried to compute the sum using a different method that didn&#39;t directly compute the array and its prefix sum. The initial approach&#39;s method was incorrect because it tried to compute the sum for each query using a different formula that didn&#39;t account for the correct way the array was built.              So the correct approach is to build the array using a sieve, then compute prefix sums, and answer queries in O(1) time.              So the steps for the code are:              Read N and K.              Read the K X_j&#39;s, count their frequencies.              Initialize an array of zeros of size N.              For each d in the frequency dictionary:                  for i from 0 to N-1 step d:                      array[i] += freq[d]              Compute the prefix sum array.              Read Q queries, for each query L and R:                  if L ==0:                      output prefix[R]                  else:                      output prefix[R] - prefix[L-1]              So this approach is correct.              Now, for the sample input 1:              After processing d=1 (freq=3), the array becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3].              Then processing d=2 (freq=1), add 1 to 0,2,4,6,8 → array becomes [4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3].              Prefix sum array is [4,7,11,14,18,21,25,28,32,35].              For query 0-9: 35.              Which matches.              For query 2-6: elements are 4 (index2),3 (3),4 (4),3 (5),4 (6). Sum 4+3+4+3+4=18.              So this approach is correct.              So the code will be:              Read N and K.              Read X list, compute freq using a dictionary.              Initialize array to zero.              For each d in freq:                  for i in 0 to N-1 step d:                      array[i] += freq[d]              Compute prefix sums.              Read Q queries, and for each L, R:                  if L ==0:                      print(prefix[R])                  else:                      print(prefix[R] - prefix[L-1])              Now, considering the constraints:              N is up to 1e6.              K is up to 1e6.              For each d in freq, we loop through all multiples of d. The total number of operations is O(N log N), which is acceptable.              For example, for d=1, it&#39;s O(N) operations.              For d=2, O(N/2) operations.              Summing over all d, the total is O(N log N), which for N=1e6 is about 1e7 operations.              The prefix sum array is O(N), which is manageable.              Then, Q queries are answered in O(1) time.              So this approach is correct and efficient.              Now, for the sample input 2:              N=11, K=3.              X_j&#39;s:3,7,10.              freq[3]=1, freq[7]=1, freq[10]=1.              Processing each d:              d=3:                  multiples are 0,3,6,9.                  add 1 to each of these.              d=7:                  multiples are 0,7.                  add 1.              d=10:                  multiples are 0,10 → but N=11, so 10 is &lt;11.                  add 1 to 0 and 10.              So array is:              index 0:1+1+1=3.              indexes 3:1.              indexes6:1.              index9:1.              index7:1.              index10:1.              All others are 0.              So the array is:              [3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1].              Sum for 0-10 is3+0+0+1+0+0+1+1+0+1+1=8.              Which matches sample output 2.              So the code is correct.              Now, implementing this in Python.              However, for large N (1e6), using a list of size N and modifying each element could be efficient enough.              In Python, for N=1e6, creating a list of zeros is feasible.              But when K is up to 1e6, and each X_j is up to N-1, we need to count frequencies, then for each d in freq, loop through multiples.              But for d=1, we have N iterations. For d=2, N/2, etc. Which for N=1e6 could be O(1e6) operations per d=1, but in Python, this might be slow.              For example, if K=1e6 and all X_j=1, then d=1 has freq=1e6, and the code would add 1e6 to each index in the array. Which is O(1e6) operations for d=1.              But this would be too slow.              Wait, no. Because the frequency of d=1 is 1e6. So when processing d=1, we add 1e6 to each multiple of 1, i.e., all indices.              So in the code, for each d in freq, the code does for i in 0 to N-1 step d: array[i] += freq[d}.              So for d=1, it&#39;s O(N) operations.              For K=1e6 and all X_j=1, this loop will run N times (for d=1), adding 1e6 to each element. Which is O(N) operations, which for N=1e6 is manageable.              But adding to each element in the array is O(N), which is acceptable.              However, in Python, for large N, it&#39;s possible that this approach is too slow. For example, if N=1e6 and K=1e6, each X_j is 1, then the code would run a loop of 1e6 steps for d=1, and for each step, add 1e6 to each element. Which is O(1e6) operations for d=1.              But this is manageable.              Alternatively, we can optimize the sieve step by precomputing all d&#39;s and their frequencies, then for each d from 1 to N-1, adding freq[d} to all multiples of d.              In Python, using for loops for this may be slow for large N and K. So we need to find a way to optimize.              One possible optimization is to precompute for each d from 1 to N-1, and for each multiple, add freq[d} to the array. This can be done using list comprehensions or other optimized methods.              But in Python, even with N=1e6, the sieve approach is feasible.              Let&#39;s test with a small example.              For N=10 and d=2, the multiples are 0,2,4,6,8.              So in code:              for i in range(0, N, d):                  array[i] += freq[d]              Which for d=2 would iterate 5 times.              So this is correct.              So in code:              import sys              from collections import defaultdict              def main():                  import sys                  input = sys.stdin.read().split()                  ptr =0                  N, K = map(int, input[ptr:ptr+2])                  ptr +=2                  X = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+K]))                  ptr +=K                  Q = int(input[ptr])                  ptr +=1                  queries = []                  for _ in range(Q):                      L, R = map(int, input[ptr:ptr+2])                      queries.append( (L, R) )                      ptr +=2                  # Compute frequency                  freq = defaultdict(int)                  for x in X:                      freq[x] +=1                  # Initialize array                  array = [0]*N                  for d in freq:                      for i in range(0, N, d):                          array[i] += freq[d]                  # Compute prefix sum                  prefix = [0]*(N+1)                  for i in range(N):                      prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + array[i]                  # Answer queries                  for L, R in queries:                      print( prefix[R+1] - prefix[L] )              if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:                  main()              Wait, but wait: in the code, the array indices are 0-based, and the prefix sum is 0-based with prefix[0]=0, prefix[1] =array[0], prefix[2] =array[0]+array[1], etc. So for query [L, R], the sum is prefix[R+1] - prefix[L].              For example, for L=0, R=9:              prefix[10] - prefix[0] = sum of array[0..9].              Which is correct.              For L=2, R=6:              sum array[2] + array[3] + array[4] + array[5] + array[6].              Which is prefix[7] - prefix[2].              So the code uses prefix[R+1] - prefix[L}.              This is correct.              Testing the sample input 1:              The array is [4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3,4,3].              The prefix sum would be:              prefix[0] =0              prefix[1] =4              prefix[2] =7              prefix[3] =11              prefix[4] =14              prefix[5] =18              prefix[6] =21              prefix[7] =25              prefix[8] =28              prefix[9] =32              prefix[10] =35              For query 0-9: 35-0=35.              For query 2-6: L=2, R=6. R+1=7. prefix[7] =25, prefix[2] =7. 25-7=18.              For query7-7: L=7, R=7. R+1=8. prefix[8] - prefix[7} =28-25=3.              Which matches.              So the code is correct.              Now, for performance, the code should efficiently handle N=1e6 and K=1e6.              In Python, using for loops for each d and each multiple is feasible if the frequencies are handled correctly.              However, for d=1 and freq[d]=1e6, the code would loop 1e6 times for each multiple of 1 (i.e., all N elements), which would take O(N) time per d=1. For N=1e6, that&#39;s acceptable.              But in Python, for N=1e6, even a loop that runs 1e6 times can take a noticeable amount of time. But given the constraints, it&#39;s manageable.              Alternatively, we can precompute all the divisors and use sieve-like approaches, but the current approach is the most straightforward.              So the code is correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute the sum of elements in specific ranges of an array after applying a series of operations. The operations involve incrementing elements at indices that are multiples of given values. Given the constraints, a direct approach would be too slow, so we use a sieve-like method to preprocess the array and answer each query in constant time. Approach1. Frequency Count: First, count the frequency of each value used in the operations.2. Array Construction: Using a sieve-like approach, update the array to reflect the increments caused by each value. For each value, increment all its multiples in the array by its frequency.3. Prefix Sum Array: Construct a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.4. Query Processing: For each query, use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the specified range efficiently. Solution Code```pythonimport sysfrom collections import defaultdictdef main():    input = sys.stdin.read().split()    ptr = 0    N, K = map(int, input[ptr:ptr+2])    ptr += 2    X = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+K]))    ptr += K    Q = int(input[ptr])    ptr += 1    queries = []    for _ in range(Q):        L, R = map(int, input[ptr:ptr+2])        queries.append((L, R))        ptr += 2    # Compute frequency of each X    freq = defaultdict(int)    for x in X:        if x &lt; N:  # Ensure x is a valid jump to avoid adding out of bounds            freq[x] += 1    # Initialize the array and apply the sieve-like increments    array = [0] * N    for d in freq:        cnt = freq[d]        for i in range(0, N, d):            array[i] += cnt    # Compute the prefix sum array    prefix = [0] * (N + 1)    for i in range(N):        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + array[i]    # Process each query and output the result    for L, R in queries:        print(prefix[R + 1] - prefix[L])if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()``` Explanation1. Frequency Count: We use a dictionary to count how many times each value is used in the operations. This helps in efficiently applying increments later.2. Sieve-like Array Update: For each value, we update all its multiples in the array by its frequency. This ensures that each element in the array correctly reflects the number of times it was incremented.3. Prefix Sum Array: By constructing a prefix sum array, we can quickly compute the sum of any subarray. The prefix sum at index `i` contains the sum of elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.4. Efficient Query Handling: For each query, we use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the range in constant time by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the range from the prefix sum at the end of the range.This approach ensures that we preprocess the array in O(N log N) time, making each query answerable in O(1) time, which is efficient for large input sizes.</p><div class="divider" data-v-c5b64b40></div><p class="review-content" data-v-c5b64b40><span class="icon" data-v-c5b64b40>🔑:</span></p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-30f0ed69><span data-v-30f0ed69>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
