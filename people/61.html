represented as a non-empty line consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Berland scientists found out that all the creatures evolve by stages. During one stage exactly one symbol of the DNA line is replaced by exactly two other ones. At that overall there are *n* permissible substitutions. The substitution *ai*-&amp;gt;*bici* means that any one symbol *ai* can be replaced with two symbols *bici*. Every substitution could happen an unlimited number of times.They say that two creatures with DNA sequences *s*1 and *s*2 can have a common ancestor if there exists such a DNA sequence *s*3 that throughout evolution it can result in *s*1 and *s*2, perhaps after a different number of stages. Your task is to find out by the given *s*1 and *s*2 whether the creatures possessing such DNA sequences can have a common ancestor. If the answer is positive, you have to find the length of the shortest sequence of the common ancestor’s DNA.The first line contains a non-empty DNA sequence *s*1, the second line contains a non-empty DNA sequence *s*2. The lengths of these lines do not exceed 50, the lines contain only lowercase Latin letters. The third line contains an integer *n* (0&lt;=≤&lt;=*n*&lt;=≤&lt;=50) — the number of permissible substitutions. Then follow *n* lines each of which describes a substitution in the format *ai*-&amp;gt;*bici*. The characters *ai*, *bi*, and *ci* are lowercase Latin letters. Lines *s*1 and *s*2 can coincide, the list of substitutions can contain similar substitutions.If *s*1 and *s*2 cannot have a common ancestor, print -1. Otherwise print the length of the shortest sequence *s*3, from which *s*1 and *s*2 could have evolved.Sample Inputababaaba2c-&amp;gt;bac-&amp;gt;ccababaaba7c-&amp;gt;bac-&amp;gt;cce-&amp;gt;abz-&amp;gt;eab-&amp;gt;bad-&amp;gt;ddd-&amp;gt;abababaaba1c-&amp;gt;baSample Output21-1</div><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🧠:</span>Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.The problem is about DNA sequences and substitutions. Two DNA sequences s1 and s2 can have a common ancestor if there exists some sequence s3 that can evolve into both s1 and s2 through a series of substitutions. Each substitution replaces a single character with two others. The goal is to find the minimal possible length of such a common ancestor s3, or return -1 if it&#39;s impossible.Hmm. So the core idea is to find a sequence s3 that can be transformed into both s1 and s2 by applying the substitutions in reverse. Because when you apply substitutions, the DNA gets longer each step (since each substitution replaces one character with two). But to find the common ancestor, we need to reverse the process. So instead of expanding s3 into s1 and s2, we need to reduce s1 and s2 into some common s3 by applying the substitutions in reverse. Wait, that makes sense. Because during evolution, the substitutions add characters. So the ancestor would have a shorter sequence that, through expansion, becomes s1 and s2. So to find the ancestor, we need to see if s1 and s2 can be reduced down to the same sequence by reversing the substitutions. Reversing here would mean that a pair of characters (bi, ci) can be replaced by ai if there&#39;s a substitution ai -&gt; bi ci. Because each substitution step in the forward direction increases the length by 1 (since one character becomes two), the reverse steps would decrease the length by 1 each time.So the approach is to model this as a BFS problem where we try to find the shortest possible sequence that can be reduced from both s1 and s2. The minimal length of such a common sequence would be the answer.Wait, but how do we model the possible reductions? For each possible sequence derived from s1 and s2 by applying reverse substitutions, we need to find if there&#39;s an intersection between the possible reduced sequences of s1 and s2. The minimal length of such a common sequence is the answer.So the plan is:1. For both s1 and s2, generate all possible sequences that can be formed by applying reverse substitutions any number of times. This includes sequences obtained by repeatedly replacing pairs of characters (bi ci) with ai if there&#39;s a substitution ai -&gt; bi ci.2. Find the common sequences in both sets. The minimal length among these is the answer. If there are no common sequences, output -1.But since the lengths of s1 and s2 can be up to 50, the possible sequences after reductions could have lengths decreasing by 1 each step. For example, s1 of length 50 could be reduced to 49, 48, etc., down to 1. But how do the substitutions affect possible reductions?Wait, each reverse substitution reduces the length by 1. For example, if we have a substitution a -&gt; b c, then in reverse, whenever we have the substring &#39;bc&#39; in a sequence, we can replace it with &#39;a&#39;, reducing the length by 1 (since two characters become one).But wait, the reverse substitution can be applied anywhere in the sequence where a pair matches bi ci. So for a given sequence, each possible occurrence of a pair (bi ci) that has a substitution ai -&gt; bi ci can be replaced by ai. Each such replacement reduces the length by 1.So the problem is similar to a BFS where each state is a string, and transitions are possible by replacing any occurrence of a pair (bi ci) with ai. The goal is to find the shortest possible string (minimal length) that is reachable from both s1 and s2 via these reverse substitutions.So the steps would be:- For each input string (s1 and s2), generate all possible strings that can be formed by reversing the substitutions, along with the minimal steps (or lengths) required to reach them. Then, find the intersection between the two sets of strings. The minimal length among these is the answer.But generating all possible strings for each s1 and s2 could be computationally expensive. However, since the original sequences can be up to length 50, and each reverse step reduces the length by 1, the maximum possible number of steps for each is up to 49 steps (from 50 to 1). So for each initial string, the possible lengths after reductions are from its original length down to 1. But the problem is that for each step, there might be multiple possibilities due to multiple substitutions and multiple positions to replace.For example, if the current string is &#39;abc&#39; and substitutions are a-&gt;xy, b-&gt;yz, c-&gt;zz, then possible reverse steps would look for pairs in the string. But perhaps there&#39;s no applicable substitutions. So the string can&#39;t be reduced further.So the approach is to model the possible reductions using BFS for each of s1 and s2. We can build a map of possible strings (as keys) and their minimal lengths for both s1 and s2. Then, find the intersection of the keys in both maps. Among these, the minimal length is the answer.But how do we efficiently compute all possible reduced strings for each input?Let&#39;s think about BFS. For each string, we can apply all possible reverse substitutions and generate new strings. We need to track visited strings to avoid processing the same string multiple times. However, since the problem allows for the substitutions to be applied in any order and any possible positions, the same string can be reached via different paths but with the same minimal length (since BFS ensures the shortest path is found first).So for each of s1 and s2, we perform BFS to find all possible reduced strings and their minimal possible lengths. Then, we check for overlapping strings between the two BFS results. The minimal combined length (sum of steps?) no, wait. Wait, the minimal length of the common ancestor. Because each reduction step decreases the length by 1. So the ancestor&#39;s length is the current length minus the number of steps taken. For example, if s1 is length 5 and reduced in 3 steps to a string of length 2, then the ancestor for s1 in that case is length 2. Similarly, if s2 is reduced in 1 step to length 3, then the ancestor&#39;s length would be 3. But for the common ancestor, it has to be a string that can be reduced from both s1 and s2. Wait, no. The ancestor s3 is a string that can be expanded into s1 and s2. So s3 is the common ancestor, and both s1 and s2 are reachable by applying substitutions (expanding) from s3. But in the reverse process, the ancestor s3 would be a string that can be obtained by reverse substitutions (i.e., reductions) from both s1 and s2. So the minimal possible length of s3 is the minimal length that is present in both the reductions of s1 and s2.Wait, that&#39;s right. Because the ancestor&#39;s length is the length of s3. When you reduce s1 and s2, the minimal possible s3 is the one with the smallest possible length that is common to both.So the plan is:1. For s1, generate all possible reduced sequences (by applying reverse substitutions as much as possible) and track their minimal lengths.2. Do the same for s2.3. Find all sequences that are present in both sets. Among those, find the one with the smallest length. That&#39;s the answer.If there are no such sequences, output -1.But how to generate all possible reductions?For each string, the BFS starts with the original string. For each step, we generate all possible reductions by replacing any occurrence of a pair (bi ci) with ai, for each substitution ai -&gt; bi ci.Each such replacement gives a new string. We need to explore all possible paths, keeping track of the minimal length of each string.Wait, but the minimal length is just the original length minus the number of steps taken. Because each reverse substitution reduces the length by 1. So the more steps you take, the shorter the string becomes.But the BFS for each string will generate all possible reduced strings with lengths from the original down to 1 (if possible). But some strings may not be reducible beyond a certain point. For example, if there are no substitutions applicable to a string, then it can&#39;t be reduced further.So the BFS approach for each string (s1 and s2) would explore all possible reduced forms. For each string, the BFS would track all possible strings that can be obtained by any sequence of reverse substitutions, along with their lengths.Now, the challenge is to model this efficiently.Let&#39;s outline the steps for BFS:For a given initial string s:- Initialize a queue with s.- Keep a dictionary (or a set) to track visited strings and their minimal lengths (since once a string is processed, any future occurrences would have a longer or equal length, so we can ignore them if already visited).For each step:- Dequeue a string current_str.- Generate all possible possible strings by applying all possible reverse substitutions to all possible positions in current_str.For example, if current_str is &#39;abc&#39;, and there is a substitution a -&gt; bc (so reverse substitution is replacing &#39;bc&#39; with &#39;a&#39;), then we look for any occurrence of &#39;bc&#39; in the string. For each occurrence, replace it with &#39;a&#39; to get a new string. So if &#39;bc&#39; is in positions 1-2, then replacing gives &#39;a a&#39; (assuming indexes start at 0, but need to check).Wait, the substitution is ai -&gt; bi ci, so reverse substitution is when bi ci is present in the string and can be replaced by ai. So for each substitution in the list, we look for pairs of characters in the current string that match bi and ci. For each such pair, we can replace them with ai, resulting in a new string.So for each substitution (ai, bi, ci), we can scan the current_str for occurrences of bi followed by ci. Each occurrence can be replaced by ai, resulting in a new string. For example, if substitution is a-&gt;bc, then reverse substitution is replacing bc with a.So for each substitution, generate all possible positions where the pair (bi, ci) occurs, replace them with ai, and add the new string to the queue if it hasn&#39;t been visited yet.But since substitutions can have the same (bi, ci) pairs (like two different substitutions that have the same bi and ci but different ai), then each occurrence of (bi, ci) can be replaced by any of the possible ai&#39;s. Wait, no. The substitution is given as ai -&gt; bi ci. So in the reverse direction, the pair bi ci can only be replaced by ai. So for example, substitution c-&gt;ba means that in reverse, ba can be replaced by c. Similarly, substitution e-&gt;ab would mean that ab can be replaced by e. So each pair (bi, ci) in the substitution list corresponds to a possible replacement by ai.So for a substitution ai-&gt;bi ci, the reverse substitution is that whenever bi and ci are adjacent in the string, they can be replaced by ai.So, for the current_str, for each substitution, check all possible positions where the pair bi ci occurs. For each occurrence, create a new string by replacing bi ci with ai. Then, add this new string to the queue if it hasn&#39;t been visited before.So, the BFS for each s1 and s2 would generate all possible strings that can be obtained by any number of reverse substitutions.But how to model this? Let&#39;s think of the substitutions as a dictionary where the key is the pair (bi, ci) and the value is a list of ai&#39;s (but wait, each substitution is ai-&gt;bi ci, so for a given pair (bi, ci), there may be multiple ai&#39;s possible. For example, if substitutions are a-&gt;xy and b-&gt;xy, then the pair xy can be replaced by either a or b. So when processing the pair xy in the string, you can generate two new strings: one where xy is replaced by a, and another where replaced by b.Wait, but the substitution is given as ai-&gt;bi ci. So the reverse substitution would be for each ai, the pair bi ci can be replaced by ai. So the pair bi ci can be replaced by ai. So for a substitution list, for each substitution, the pair (bi, ci) can be replaced by ai. So the key is the pair (bi, ci), and the value is a list of possible ai&#39;s.Wait, no. Each substitution is a separate entry. For example, if two substitutions are a-&gt;xy and b-&gt;xy, then for the pair (x, y), there are two possible ai&#39;s: a and b. So when a pair (x, y) occurs in the string, we can replace it with a or b. Each substitution gives a possible way to replace the pair.So, for the substitution list, we need to build a map from (b, c) to a list of a&#39;s. So for each substitution ai -&gt; bi ci, we add to the map the key (bi, ci) and append ai to the list of possible replacements.So during BFS processing of a string, for every possible position in the string, check if the pair (current_char, next_char) exists in the substitution map. If so, for each possible a in the list, generate a new string by replacing the two characters with a. Then, proceed.So, during BFS:For the current string, for each possible position i (from 0 to len(current_str) - 2), look at the pair (current_str[i], current_str[i+1]). Check if this pair is in the substitution map. If yes, then for each possible a in the list associated with that pair, create a new string by removing the two characters at i and inserting a. Then, add this new string to the queue if it hasn&#39;t been visited before.This approach will generate all possible reduced strings for each step.But this could be computationally intensive. For example, if the current string is length 50, there are 49 possible pairs. For each pair that matches any substitution, multiple new strings can be generated. However, considering that the problem constraints are n up to 50 and the input strings up to 50 characters, but the BFS for each string may have a lot of possibilities, but maybe manageable.But how to manage the visited set? Since the same string can be generated via different paths, but once a string is added to the visited set (with a certain minimal length), any subsequent paths to it would have longer steps (since BFS processes shorter steps first). Wait, no. Because each step reduces the length by 1. So the first time a string is generated, it&#39;s via the minimal number of steps (i.e., the earliest possible level in BFS). Because BFS proceeds level by level, each level corresponding to a certain length. For example, the original string has length L. After one reverse substitution, length L-1. Then L-2, etc. So BFS would process all possible strings of length L, then L-1, then L-2, and so on. Once a string is processed at length K, any subsequent processing of the same string would have a longer path (i.e., lower K, but we&#39;re moving towards lower K). Wait, no. Wait, each step reduces the length. So the BFS levels are ordered by the current length. The original string is at level L. Each step takes it to level L-1, then L-2, etc. So for a given string, once it&#39;s processed at level K, any other occurrence of it in a higher level (i.e., lower K&#39;) where K&#39; &lt; K would have already been processed. Wait, maybe I need to model the visited set as a map from string to the minimal possible length. Because once a string is processed at a certain length, any shorter paths (i.e., longer lengths) can be ignored.Wait, no. For example, suppose a string &#39;a&#39; can be generated in two ways: one via a path that takes 3 steps (so length original length -3), or another via a path that takes 5 steps (original length -5). But since each step reduces the length by 1, the first way would have the string &#39;a&#39; appear at a higher level (higher length) than the second. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the original length is L, then each step reduces the length by 1. So after k steps, the length is L - k. So the BFS processes all possibilities for the current length, and then proceeds to the next lower length. So the first time a string is encountered is at the highest possible length (smallest number of steps). Because once a string is added to the visited set with a certain length, any subsequent occurrences (with the same or smaller length) can be ignored. Because if the same string is encountered again in a lower level (i.e., shorter length), then it&#39;s already been processed, and there&#39;s no need to process it again as it would have a longer path (more steps, but shorter length). Wait, no. Wait, the length is the original length minus the number of steps taken. So for a given string s, its length is fixed. So if we process a string s, which has length K, then any other occurrence of s would have the same K. So the visited set can just be a set of strings. Because once a string is added to the visited set, we don&#39;t need to process it again. Because any occurrence of the same string would have the same length as before. Because each step reduces the length by 1. So the same string can&#39;t appear in multiple lengths. Because a string&#39;s length is determined by how many steps were taken. For example, if you have a string &#39;a&#39; that was obtained after 3 steps from a string of length 5, then its length is 5-3=2. Wait, no. Wait, the initial string is s1, which has length L. Each reverse substitution step reduces the length by 1. So after k steps, the length is L -k. So the same string can&#39;t appear at different lengths. For example, if s1 is &#39;ababa&#39; (length 5), then after 3 steps, the length is 2. If another path reaches the same string in 2 steps, that would imply the length is 3, which is impossible. So the same string can only appear once in the BFS process. Therefore, the visited set can be a simple set of strings. Once a string is added, no need to process it again.Therefore, the BFS can be implemented with a queue and a visited set. For each string in the queue, generate all possible replacements via substitutions, and for each new string, if not in visited, add to the queue and visited.So the steps for each BFS:For the initial string s:- Create a queue and add s to it.- Create a visited set and add s to it.- Create a map (say, from strings to their minimal possible lengths) but since the length is s.length - steps taken, and steps taken is (initial length - current length), perhaps we don&#39;t need to track it. Wait, but we need to find the minimal possible length of the common ancestor, which is the minimal possible length that can be reduced from both s1 and s2.Wait, the minimal possible length of the common ancestor is the minimal length possible. So for each common string in the BFS paths of s1 and s2, the length is (original length of s1) - steps taken for s1, which must be equal to (original length of s2) - steps taken for s2. Wait, no. Because the ancestor s3 must be a string that can be expanded into s1 and s2. So s3 can be transformed into s1 via some number of steps, and into s2 via some other steps. But the length of s3 must be such that when expanded, it reaches s1 and s2. So the lengths of s3 must be less than or equal to the lengths of s1 and s2, but since the expansion steps add to the length.Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me rephrase.In the forward direction (ancestor to s1 or s2), each substitution step increases the length by 1. So if the ancestor s3 has length L, then s1&#39;s length is L + k1 steps, s2&#39;s length is L + k2 steps. So L = len(s1) - k1 = len(s2) -k2. But k1 and k2 are non-negative integers (since the steps are the number of substitutions applied). So for s3 to be a common ancestor, len(s3) must be such that len(s1) - len(s3) and len(s2) - len(s3) are both non-negative and equal to the number of steps taken for each. But in the reverse direction, when we process s1 and s2 to find s3, the reverse steps (reductions) must result in s3. So for s1, the number of reverse steps is len(s1) - len(s3), and similarly for s2. So the minimal possible len(s3) would be the smallest possible len(s3) that is reachable from both s1 and s2 via reverse steps. Therefore, the answer is the minimal len(s3) among all common s3&#39;s.So, the approach is to perform BFS for both s1 and s2, track all possible reduced strings and their lengths, then find the common strings and select the one with the smallest length.But how to track the possible lengths for each string. Wait, no. Because the same string can&#39;t be generated at different lengths. Because each step reduces the length by 1, so once a string is generated at a certain length (say, L), any other occurrence would have the same length. So, the BFS for s1 would generate all possible strings that can be reduced from s1, each with a certain length (s1_length - steps). Similarly for s2.Thus, for each string in the BFS of s1, its length is known (original length minus steps taken). Similarly for s2. So when we find a common string between the two BFS sets, the length is the same as the original length minus steps taken. But since the steps for s1 and s2 can differ, the length of the common string could be different. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Because the same string can be generated in different ways with different lengths? But no, because for a given string s, its length is fixed. So if s appears in the BFS of s1, it has a length of len(s1) - k1 steps. And in the BFS of s2, it must have a length of len(s2) - k2 steps. But for s to be the same string, those two lengths must be the same. Because the same string has a unique length. So len(s1) -k1 = len(s2) -k2. So for s to be a common ancestor, it must satisfy len(s3) = len(s1) -k1 = len(s2) -k2. Which implies that (len(s1) - len(s2)) = k1 -k2. But since k1 and k2 are non-negative integers (steps taken to reduce from s1 and s2), the difference in lengths between s1 and s2 must be equal to the difference in steps taken. But how can that be? Because s3&#39;s length is len(s3) = len(s1) -k1 = len(s2) -k2. So len(s1) - len(s2) = k1 -k2. For example, if s1 is longer than s2 by m, then k1 must be k2 + m. Because len(s1) -k1 = len(s2) -k2 =&gt; (len(s1) - len(s2)) = k1 -k2. So if len(s1) &gt; len(s2), then k1 must be &gt;= k2, and the difference is m.But when we perform BFS on s1 and s2, the possible strings generated for each have lengths that decrease from the original length. So in the BFS for s1, the possible strings have lengths len(s1), len(s1)-1, ..., down to 1. Similarly for s2.So when looking for common strings between the two BFS sets, their lengths must be compatible. Because a string s3 must have len(s3) = len(s1) -k1 and also len(s3) = len(s2) -k2, which implies that len(s1) - len(s2) must equal k1 -k2. But how can that be possible if, for example, len(s1) is 5 and len(s2) is 3. Then len(s1) - len(s2) = 2. So k1 must be 2 +k2. So for each s3 that&#39;s common, the len(s3) can be len(s1) -k1 = len(s2) - (k1 -2). So possible len(s3) would vary.But the key is that the same string s3 must appear in both BFS sets. So when building the BFS for s1 and s2, the visited sets for each will include all possible reduced strings and their corresponding lengths (but the length is not stored since it&#39;s determined by the original length minus steps). But since the same string can&#39;t appear in multiple lengths, when we check for common strings between the two BFS visited sets, their lengths must be such that len(s3) = len(s1) -k1 and len(s3) = len(s2) -k2. So len(s3) must be equal for both. Which implies that len(s1) -k1 = len(s2) -k2. So the steps taken for s1 and s2 must differ by len(s1) - len(s2). But this is possible.But when we collect the strings from both BFS, their lengths are fixed based on their original lengths and steps taken. So when we find a common string between the two, it&#39;s possible only if len(s1) -k1 == len(s2) -k2, which may not be possible for some combinations. For example, if s1 has length 5 and s2 has length 3. Then, the possible len(s3) would be 5 -k1 and 3 -k2. For these to be equal, 5 -k1 =3 -k2 → k1 -k2 =2. So possible len(s3) could be 3 -k2 =5 - (k2+2) → 3 -k2 =3 -k2. So possible.But in practice, when we generate the BFS for s1 and s2, all possible reduced strings are stored, regardless of their lengths. When we look for common strings between the two sets, their lengths must be compatible.Wait, no. Because for example, s1 can reduce to &#39;a&#39; in 4 steps (so len(s1) -4 = 5-4=1). s2 can reduce to &#39;a&#39; in 2 steps (len(s2) -2=3-2=1). So &#39;a&#39; is in both BFS sets, and its length is 1. So len(s3) is 1.So the answer would be 1.So in this case, the common string is &#39;a&#39; with length 1. So the minimal possible len(s3) is 1.But how do we track the len(s3) for each possible common string? Because the len(s3) is determined by the steps taken from each original string.But in the BFS process, each string in the BFS of s1 has a len equal to len(s1) minus the number of steps taken to reach it. Similarly for s2. So when a string is present in both BFS sets, the len(s3) must be equal for both paths. Because the same string can&#39;t have two different lengths. So len(s1) -k1 = len(s2) -k2. Thus, the steps taken for s1 and s2 must differ by len(s1) - len(s2). But when building the BFS, the steps are implicitly tracked by the length. So when we find a common string, its length is fixed, and thus the steps for each path are len(s1) - len(s3) and len(s2) - len(s3).Therefore, when we collect all the strings in s1&#39;s BFS and s2&#39;s BFS, the common strings are those that can be reduced from both, and their lengths are such that len(s3) is the same in both cases. So, to find the minimal len(s3), we can collect all common strings between the two BFS sets and select the one with the smallest len.So, the steps to solve the problem are:1. Read s1, s2, and the substitution list.2. Preprocess the substitution list into a map from (bi, ci) to a list of ai&#39;s.3. For both s1 and s2, perform BFS to collect all possible reduced strings, using the reverse substitutions.4. For each string in s1&#39;s BFS set, check if it&#39;s present in s2&#39;s BFS set. Collect all such common strings.5. Among the common strings, find the one with the smallest length. That&#39;s the answer.6. If no common strings exist, output -1.Now, the next step is to implement this in Python.But how to handle the substitutions? Let&#39;s see. For each substitution in the input, which is given in the form ai -&gt; bi ci. So for example, a substitution line is &quot;c-&gt;ba&quot;. So ai is &#39;c&#39;, and bi and ci are &#39;b&#39; and &#39;a&#39; respectively. So in the reverse substitution, whenever &#39;ba&#39; appears in the string, it can be replaced by &#39;c&#39;.So, we need to create a dictionary where the keys are tuples (bi, ci), and the values are lists of possible ai&#39;s.So, the substitution map would be a defaultdict(list). For each substitution in the input, we split the line into ai -&gt; bc. Then, add to substitution_map[(b, c)] the ai.Wait, but the substitution is ai -&gt; bi ci. So when reversed, bi and ci are the pair that can be replaced by ai. So the substitution_map should map (bi, ci) to ai.But there could be multiple substitutions that have the same (bi, ci) pair, leading to multiple possible ai&#39;s. For example:substitution 1: a -&gt; bcsubstitution 2: d -&gt; bcIn this case, the pair (b, c) can be replaced by a or d. So during BFS processing, whenever the pair (b, c) is found in the current string, both &#39;a&#39; and &#39;d&#39; are possible replacements. So each substitution adds an entry to the list for (bi, ci).Therefore, the substitution_map is a dictionary where each key is a tuple (bi, ci), and the value is a list of ai&#39;s.So in code:substitution_map = defaultdict(list)for each substitution line:    line = line.strip()    ai, rest = line.split(&#39;-&gt;&#39;)    bi_ci = rest.strip()    bi = bi_ci[0]    ci = bi_ci[1]    substitution_map[(bi, ci)].append(ai)Once this map is built, during BFS processing, for each pair of adjacent characters in the current string, we check if they are a key in substitution_map. If so, for each ai in the list, we generate a new string by replacing the pair with ai, and proceed.Now, implementing the BFS for a string s:def bfs(s, substitution_map):    visited = set()    queue = deque()    queue.append(s)    visited.add(s)    while queue:        current = queue.popleft()        yield current  # or collect all generated strings into a set        # generate all possible reductions        for i in range(len(current) -1):            pair = (current[i], current[i+1])            if pair in substitution_map:                for ai in substitution_map[pair]:                    # create the new string by replacing i and i+1 with ai                    new_str = current[:i] + ai + current[i+2:]                    if new_str not in visited:                        visited.add(new_str)                        queue.append(new_str)    return visitedWait, but this code has a problem. For example, the pair (current[i], current[i+1]) may have multiple ai&#39;s in substitution_map. For each ai, a new string is created. All possible new_str&#39;s are added to the queue if not visited. So this will generate all possible replacements for all possible substitutions applicable to each pair.But the code as written would process each possible substitution in the substitution_map for each pair.But what if there are multiple substitutions for the same pair? For example, substitutions a-&gt;xy and b-&gt;xy. So (x,y) can be replaced by a or b. So when processing a pair (x,y), both a and b are options, leading to two new strings.Yes, this code would generate both possibilities.Now, the BFS for s1 and s2 would generate all possible reduced strings. Then, the intersection of the two sets is checked.But how to collect the visited sets for both s1 and s2.Once the substitution_map is built, we can run BFS for s1 and s2, collect their visited sets, and find the intersection.The minimal length among the common strings is the answer.But what about the order of processing? For example, the BFS for s1 may generate &#39;a&#39; with length 1 (after 4 steps), and the BFS for s2 may generate &#39;a&#39; with length 1 (after 2 steps). So in the common strings, &#39;a&#39; is present, and its length is 1. So the answer is 1.So in code:s1_visited = bfs(s1, substitution_map)s2_visited = bfs(s2, substitution_map)common = s1_visited.intersection(s2_visited)if not common:    print(-1)else:    min_len = min(len(s) for s in common)    print(min_len)But the code for bfs function should return the set of all possible reduced strings (including the original string). Wait, the BFS starts with the original string and generates all possible reductions, but including the original string. Wait, no. Because the original string is added to the visited set. Then, for each step, the code processes the current string, then generates all possible new strings by applying substitutions. But the original string is added to the visited set first. So for example, if the original string can&#39;t be reduced (no substitutions possible), then the BFS returns just the original string.Wait, but in the code above, when we start the BFS, the queue is initialized with the original string. Then, in the first iteration, we process the original string. We check all possible pairs. If none of them are in the substitution_map, then no new strings are generated. So the BFS ends, and the visited set contains only the original string. So the BFS returns all possible strings that can be obtained by reverse substitutions, including the original string (since it&#39;s possible to have zero steps taken). But the problem requires that the common ancestor is a sequence that can evolve into both s1 and s2. So the ancestor could be s1 or s2 themselves, but only if one can evolve into the other.Wait, but if s1 can be evolved into s2 via substitutions (expanding steps), then s2 would be a longer sequence. But since the problem allows for different numbers of steps, the ancestor can be s1 if s1 can be transformed into s2 via expansions, or vice versa. But in the reverse process, s1&#39;s BFS includes s1 itself, and s2&#39;s BFS includes s2. So if s1 is in s2&#39;s BFS, then the common ancestor could be s1. So the code would check for s1 and s2 in each other&#39;s BFS.So, the code as written correctly captures all possible reduced strings, including the original strings.But now, there&#39;s a problem. For example, in sample input 2:Sample Input 2:ababaaba7c-&gt;bac-&gt;cce-&gt;abz-&gt;eab-&gt;bad-&gt;ddd-&gt;abSample Output is 1.So, the code for s1 is &#39;ababa&#39; (length 5). Applying reverse substitutions, perhaps we can reduce it down to a single character. Let&#39;s see.Looking at the substitutions:The substitutions are:c-&gt;ba (reverse: replace &#39;ba&#39; with c)c-&gt;cc (reverse: replace &#39;cc&#39; with c)e-&gt;ab (replace &#39;ab&#39; with e)z-&gt;ea (replace &#39;ea&#39; with z)b-&gt;ba (replace &#39;ba&#39; with b)d-&gt;dd (replace &#39;dd&#39; with d)d-&gt;ab (replace &#39;ab&#39; with d)So, in the reverse substitutions, any occurrence of &#39;ba&#39; can be replaced by c or b. Because substitution c-&gt;ba and b-&gt;ba. So when the code encounters a &#39;ba&#39; pair, it can generate two new strings: one replacing with c, the other with b.Similarly, &#39;ab&#39; can be replaced by e or d.So, for &#39;ababa&#39;, let&#39;s see possible reductions:Original string is &#39;a b a b a&#39;.Looking for pairs:Indices 0-1: a and b → check if (a,b) is in substitution_map. The substitutions that have (a,b) as bi ci are e-&gt;ab and d-&gt;ab. So (a, b) is a pair that can be replaced by e or d.So replacing (a, b) at position 0 with e: e a b a → &#39;eab a&#39; (positions 0-1 becomes e, then the rest follows). Wait, the original string is &#39;ababa&#39; → &#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;. So replacing the first two characters (a and b) with e gives &#39;e a b a&#39; → &#39;eaba&#39; (length 4). Or with d gives &#39;d a b a&#39; → &#39;daba&#39;.Then, for the next pairs:At position 1-2: &#39;b a&#39; → can be replaced by c or b (from substitutions c-&gt;ba and b-&gt;ba).So for example, in the original string, &#39;ababa&#39; can have multiple possible substitutions:Option 1: Replace (a,b) at 0-1 with e → &#39;eab a&#39; → &#39;eaba&#39; (length 4).Then, in &#39;eaba&#39;, the pairs are &#39;ea&#39;, &#39;ab&#39;, &#39;ba&#39;.Looking for substitutions:- &#39;ea&#39; can be replaced by z (from z-&gt;ea).- &#39;ab&#39; can be replaced by e or d.- &#39;ba&#39; can be replaced by c or b.So for &#39;eaba&#39; → replacing &#39;ea&#39; with z gives &#39;zba&#39; (length 3). Then &#39;zb a&#39; → &#39;z a&#39; replaced by c or b. Etc.Alternatively, perhaps in the original &#39;ababa&#39;, we can replace the &#39;ba&#39; at position 1-2 with c or b.So let&#39;s try replacing &#39;ba&#39; (positions 1-2) with c: &#39;a c b a&#39; → &#39;acba&#39; (length 4). Or with b: &#39;a b b a&#39; → &#39;abba&#39; (length 4).But this seems like a complex process. However, the BFS would explore all possible paths.Eventually, the minimal common ancestor may have length 1, as in the sample output.So the code&#39;s BFS would find all possible reductions, and the common ancestor with minimal length.Now, the code for the BFS function must generate all possible reduced strings. The code above for the BFS seems to have an issue. For example, after generating a new_str, it is added to the queue and the visited set. But the code uses a &#39;yield&#39; statement, which may not be part of the intended logic. Instead, the BFS should collect all visited strings into a set and return that set.So the BFS function should return the visited set, which contains all strings that can be obtained via reverse substitutions from the initial string.So rewriting the BFS function:from collections import dequedef get_reachable_strings(s, substitution_map):    visited = set()    queue = deque([s])    visited.add(s)    while queue:        current = queue.popleft()        for i in range(len(current) -1):            pair = (current[i], current[i+1])            if pair in substitution_map:                for a in substitution_map[pair]:                    new_str = current[:i] + a + current[i+2:]                    if new_str not in visited:                        visited.add(new_str)                        queue.append(new_str)    return visitedThis function returns all strings that can be reached by applying reverse substitutions any number of times, starting from s. Note that the initial s is included in the visited set.Now, the code reads s1, s2, and the substitutions. Then, builds the substitution_map. Then, computes the reachable strings for s1 and s2, finds their intersection, and selects the minimal length.So, the main code would be:s1 = input().strip()s2 = input().strip()n = int(input())substitution_map = defaultdict(list)for _ in range(n):    line = input().strip()    a, bc = line.split(&#39;-&gt;&#39;)    bc = bc.strip()    if len(bc) != 2:        # invalid substitution? According to problem statement, each substitution is ai -&gt; bi ci, so bc should be two chars.        # but perhaps the input is correct.        pass    b, c = bc[0], bc[1]    substitution_map[(b, c)].append(a)reachable_s1 = get_reachable_strings(s1, substitution_map)reachable_s2 = get_reachable_strings(s2, substitution_map)common = reachable_s1 &amp; reachable_s2if not common:    print(-1)else:    min_length = min(len(s) for s in common)    print(min_length)Wait, but this code may not handle the case where the same string can be generated via different pairs. But according to the BFS code, once a string is added to visited, it is not processed again. So the visited set contains all possible strings that can be generated via reverse substitutions.But what about the order in which substitutions are applied? For example, applying substitutions in different orders may yield different results. But the BFS explores all possibilities, so all possible reduced strings are added to the visited set.Now, let&#39;s test this code against the sample inputs.Sample Input 1:ababaaba2c-&gt;bac-&gt;ccSample Output: 2.Wait, according to the sample output, the answer is 2. Let&#39;s see.s1 is &#39;ababa&#39;, length 5.s2 is &#39;aba&#39;, length 3.Substitution map:For each substitution:c-&gt;ba → reverse: replace &#39;ba&#39; with c.c-&gt;cc → reverse: replace &#39;cc&#39; with c.So substitution_map has:(&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;) → [&#39;c&#39;](&#39;c&#39;,&#39;c&#39;) → [&#39;c&#39;]So during the BFS for s1:The initial string is &#39;ababa&#39;.Looking for pairs:a and b → not in substitution_map.b and a → yes. So replace &#39;ba&#39; with c.In &#39;ababa&#39;, the &#39;ba&#39;s are at positions 1-2 and 3-4.Replacing the first &#39;ba&#39; (positions 1-2) with c gives &#39;a c b a&#39; → &#39;acba&#39; (length 4).Replacing the second &#39;ba&#39; (positions 3-4) with c gives &#39;ab a c&#39; → &#39;abac&#39; (length 4).Then, for &#39;acba&#39;, process:Pairs: a and c → not in substitution_map.c and b → no.b and a → yes. Replace &#39;ba&#39; with c. So &#39;acba&#39; becomes &#39;ac c&#39; → &#39;acc&#39; (length 3).Similarly, &#39;abac&#39; → &#39;abac&#39; has pairs a-b (no), b-a (yes), a-c (no). Replace &#39;ba&#39; (positions 1-2) with c → &#39;a c c&#39; → &#39;acc&#39; (length 3).Then, &#39;acc&#39; has pairs a-c (no), c-c (yes). Replace &#39;cc&#39; with c. So &#39;acc&#39; → &#39;ac&#39; (length 2).Then &#39;ac&#39; has pairs a-c (no). So no further reductions.So the reachable strings for s1 include &#39;ababa&#39;, &#39;acba&#39;, &#39;abac&#39;, &#39;acc&#39;, &#39;ac&#39;, and &#39;a c&#39; (but maybe other steps as well).Wait, perhaps &#39;acc&#39; can be reduced to &#39;ac&#39; by replacing the &#39;cc&#39; with c. Then &#39;ac&#39; can&#39;t be reduced further. So the reachable strings for s1 include &#39;ac&#39; (length 2).For s2 &#39;aba&#39; (length 3), the BFS would look for possible reductions.The pairs are a-b and b-a.Replacing &#39;ba&#39; (positions 1-2) with c gives &#39;ac&#39; (length 2). So s2&#39;s reachable strings include &#39;aba&#39;, &#39;ac&#39;, and possibly other steps.So &#39;ac&#39; is present in both reachable sets. So the minimal length is 2.Which matches the sample output.Sample Input 2&#39;s output is 1, which implies that there&#39;s a common string of length 1.Sample Input 3:ababaaba1c-&gt;baSo substitution map has (&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;) → [&#39;c&#39;].For s1 &#39;ababa&#39;, the possible reductions would be:Replace &#39;ba&#39; at positions 1-2 and 3-4. So possible steps:&#39;ababa&#39; → &#39;acba&#39; (length 4), then &#39;acba&#39; has &#39;ba&#39; at positions 2-3 → replace with c → &#39;acc&#39; (length 3). Then &#39;acc&#39; has no substitutions possible. So reachable strings include &#39;ababa&#39;, &#39;acba&#39;, &#39;acc&#39;, &#39;abac&#39; (if other &#39;ba&#39;s are replaced). &#39;abac&#39; could be replaced to &#39;acc&#39; again. Then &#39;acc&#39; can&#39;t be reduced further.For s2 &#39;aba&#39;, the only possible reduction is &#39;ac&#39; (length 2). So the reachable sets have no common strings except possibly &#39;ac&#39; but &#39;acc&#39; is in s1&#39;s set and &#39;ac&#39; is in s2&#39;s set. So no common strings except perhaps longer ones. So the sample output is -1.Which matches the third sample.So the code seems to handle the samples correctly.Now, what about when the same pair can be replaced by multiple ai&#39;s?For example, substitutions a-&gt;xy and b-&gt;xy. So pair (x,y) can be replaced by a or b. So during BFS processing, the code would generate both possibilities.Thus, the code should handle that.Now, possible edge cases:1. s1 and s2 are the same. Then the minimal length is the minimal possible length of the string after reductions. For example, if s1 and s2 are &#39;a&#39;, then the answer is 1.But according to the code, &#39;a&#39; can&#39;t be reduced further (no substitutions), so the common set includes &#39;a&#39;, length 1. So output is 1.Another case: s1 and s2 are both &#39;ab&#39;, and substitutions include a-&gt;bc and b-&gt;cd, but no substitutions applicable. So the common set is {&#39;ab&#39;}, length 2 → output 2.Another edge case is when substitutions form a loop. For example, substitution a-&gt;aa. So in reverse, &#39;aa&#39; can be replaced by a. So the string &#39;aa&#39; can be replaced by &#39;a&#39;, and the string &#39;a&#39; can be replaced by &#39;aa&#39; (but forward substitution). But in reverse processing, &#39;a&#39; can&#39;t be replaced (since there&#39;s no substitution for a pair in &#39;a&#39;).But in reverse processing, &#39;aa&#39; can be replaced by a, and then a can&#39;t be reduced further. So the minimal length is 1.Another case: substitutions form a chain. Like a-&gt;bc, b-&gt;de, etc. But in reverse, the code would process all possible reductions.So the code should handle all these cases.Now, the code seems correct, but we need to implement it correctly.So, putting it all together:The code should read the inputs, build the substitution_map, perform BFS for s1 and s2, find the intersection, and compute the minimal length.Testing the code on the samples:Sample 1:Input:ababaaba2c-&gt;bac-&gt;ccThe code&#39;s substitution_map will have:(&#39;b&#39;,&#39;a&#39;) → [&#39;c&#39;](&#39;c&#39;,&#39;c&#39;) → [&#39;c&#39;]Reachable strings for s1 &#39;ababa&#39; include &#39;ababa&#39;, &#39;acba&#39;, &#39;abac&#39;, &#39;acc&#39;, &#39;ac&#39; (length 2).Reachable for s2 &#39;aba&#39; includes &#39;aba&#39;, &#39;ac&#39; (length 2).Common string &#39;ac&#39; with length 2. So output 2.Sample 2:The code would generate a reachable string of length 1 for both s1 and s2, so output 1.Sample 3:Only substitution is c-&gt;ba. So &#39;ba&#39; can be replaced by c.For s1 &#39;ababa&#39;, the possible reductions are:ababa → acba (length 4) → acc (length 3) → no further reductions (since &#39;acc&#39; has &#39;ac&#39; and &#39;cc&#39; which may not be present in substitution_map). So &#39;acc&#39; is length 3.s2 &#39;aba&#39; reduces to &#39;ac&#39; (length 2). So no common strings. Output -1.Thus, the code should work.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if two DNA sequences can have a common ancestor and find the length of the shortest possible ancestor sequence. The approach involves reversing the permissible substitutions to reduce the given sequences and finding the shortest common reduced sequence. Approach1. Reverse Substitutions: Instead of expanding sequences forward using substitutions, we reverse the substitutions to reduce the sequences. For example, if a substitution is `a -&gt; bc`, then `bc` can be replaced by `a` in reverse.2. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Use BFS to generate all possible reduced sequences from each input sequence. This helps in exploring all possible shorter sequences that can be formed by applying reverse substitutions.3. Intersection of Reduced Sequences: After generating all possible reduced sequences for both input sequences, find the intersection of these sets. The shortest sequence in this intersection is the answer.

Reading Input: The input consists of two DNA sequences, the number of substitutions, and the substitutions themselves.2. Building Substitution Map: Convert each substitution into a reverse mapping where a pair of characters maps to a list of possible characters that can replace them.3. BFS for Reachable Sequences: For each input sequence, generate all possible reduced sequences using BFS. This involves checking each possible pair of characters in the current sequence and replacing them according to the reverse substitutions.4. Finding Common Ancestor: Determine the intersection of the sets of reduced sequences from both input sequences. The shortest sequence in this intersection is the length of the shortest common ancestor.This approach efficiently explores all possible reductions using BFS and ensures we find the shortest possible common ancestor by checking the intersection of reduced sequences from both inputs.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-063e3695 data-v-73834811><div class="review" data-v-73834811><div class="review-title" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>❓:</span>Amr loves Chemistry, and specially doing experiments.

Now Amr wonders what is the minimum number of operations required to make all the chemicals volumes equal?The first line contains one number *n* (1&lt;=≤&lt;=*n*&lt;=≤&lt;=105), the number of chemicals.The second line contains *n* space separated integers *ai* (1&lt;=≤&lt;=*ai*&lt;=≤&lt;=105), representing the initial volume of the *i*-th chemical in liters.Output one integer the minimum number of operations required to make all the chemicals volumes equal.Sample Input34 8 233 5 6Sample Output25</div><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🧠:</span>Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Amr has to make all chemicals have equal volume by either doubling or halving (integer division) them, and find the minimal number of operations. Hmm, let&#39;s think about how to approach this.First, I need to understand what the possible target volumes could be. Each chemical can reach certain volumes by repeatedly doubling or halving. For example, if a chemical starts at 4, the possible volumes it can reach are 4, 2 (4/2), 1 (2/2), then maybe 8 (4*2), 16, etc. But wait, once you divide by two, you can&#39;t go back up unless you multiply again. Wait, no—each operation is a step. So each chemical&#39;s possible path is a tree where each node can have a parent (divided by 2 if even) or a child (multiplied by 2). But for each a_i, the possible paths could be generated by going up (halving as much as possible) and then down (multiplying). Wait, the key here is that each a_i can be transformed into any number in the set generated by repeatedly halving until you get an odd number, then multiplying by 2^k for any k. For example, take a_i=6. Let&#39;s see:6 can be divided by 2 once to get 3 (since 6/2=3, which is odd). Then from 3, you can multiply by 2 to get 6, 12, etc. So the possible base numbers for 6 are the odd numbers obtained by dividing by 2 until you can&#39;t anymore. So 6&#39;s base is 3, then possible values are 3*2^k for k &gt;=0. Similarly, 8 is 1 (divided by 2 three times), then multiplied by 2^3 (so 1*8=8). Wait, no. 8 divided by 2 three times gives 1 (8→4→2→1). Then multiplying by 2^3 gives 8 again. So each number can be reduced to its base (the odd number obtained by dividing out all 2&#39;s) and then all possible multiples of that base by 2^m. So for each a_i, the possible target volumes are the numbers along the path from the base (the maximum possible halving) upwards by multiplying. For example, a_i=4: the base is 1 (4→2→1). Then possible targets are 1*2^0=1, 1*2^1=2, 1*2^2=4, 1*2^3=8, etc. Similarly, for a_i=8, the base is 1 (divided by 2 thrice), and possible targets are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. For a_i=2, the base is 1 (2/2=1), then targets 1, 2, 4, etc.So the idea is: for each a_i, generate all possible possible target volumes (with their required steps) by moving up and down, and then find a target that is common to all chemicals, and compute the sum of steps for each chemical to reach that target. The target with the minimal total steps is the answer.But how do we efficiently find all possible targets for all a_i and compute the minimal steps? Let&#39;s think.First, for each a_i, we can generate all possible paths (targets and steps required to get there). Then, for each possible target that is present in all a_i&#39;s possible targets, compute the sum of steps and take the minimum.But with n up to 1e5, this approach might be too slow if done naively. So we need an efficient way.Let&#39;s think about how to represent the possible targets and steps for each a_i. For each a_i, the steps can be broken down into the steps taken to reach the base (halving steps) and steps taken to reach the target from the base (doubling steps). For example, if a_i is 6, which reduces to 3 (1 halving step), then multiplying by 2^k would take k steps. So any target for 6 is 3*2^k, and the steps needed are (number of halvings) + (k steps). Wait, perhaps for each a_i, we can represent all possible possible paths as follows: for each possible way of going up (multiplying) and down (halving), but perhaps the optimal path is to first halve as much as possible (to reach the base) and then multiply. Because if you first multiply and then halve, that might be equivalent to some other path. For example, if you have a number 4. Path to 8 can be either doubling once (4→8, 1 step) or (4→2→1→2→4→8, which is 3 halvings and 3 multiplications, but that&#39;s more steps). So the minimal steps for a_i to reach a certain target is to first divide by 2 as much as possible (reach the base), then multiply by 2 as needed to reach the target. Because any other path would involve more steps.So for each a_i, the minimal steps to reach a target t would be:- Let the base of a_i be b_i, obtained by dividing a_i by 2 until it&#39;s odd. Let s_i be the number of divisions (steps down) taken to get to b_i.- The target t must be equal to b_i multiplied by 2^m for some m &gt;=0. Then, the steps required for a_i to reach t is (s_i) + (m) steps (since s_i steps to get down to b_i, then m steps to multiply up to t).But wait, what if the target t is higher than a_i&#39;s original value? For example, if a_i is 8 (base 1, s_i=3 steps). Then, to reach 8 again, the steps are 3 steps (halving to 1) plus 3 steps (multiply 1*2^3=8), which is 6 steps. But wait, that&#39;s more steps than just doing nothing. So this approach isn&#39;t correct. Oh, right! Because maybe the target is the same as a_i&#39;s original value. So in that case, steps would be zero for that a_i. So this suggests that the previous reasoning is wrong.Wait, perhaps the minimal steps are not necessarily achieved by first halving to the base. Because, for a_i=8, if the target is 8, then the steps required are zero. But according to the previous approach, the steps would be s_i (3) plus m (3, since 1*2^3=8), totaling 6 steps, which is way more than zero. So that approach is incorrect.Hmm, so this suggests that the initial approach is wrong. So what&#39;s the correct way to compute the minimal steps for a_i to reach a target t?Wait, each operation can be either multiply by two or divide by two (integer division). So for a given a_i and a target t, we need to find the minimal number of operations (doubles and halves) to reach t from a_i.But how?Let me think of this as a graph where each node is a number, and edges are the operations (multiply or divide). We need to find the shortest path from a_i to t. The minimal steps would be the shortest path.For example, from 4 to 8:Option 1: multiply once → 4*2=8 (1 step).Option 2: 4 → 2 (divide once), then 2 → 4 (multiply once), then 4 →8 (another multiply). Total steps 3. So the minimal is 1 step.So in this case, the initial approach of going down to base and then up is not optimal.So the minimal steps can vary. So how to model this correctly.So the problem is that, for a_i and t, the minimal steps can be found by considering the possible paths up and down.So maybe for a_i and t, the steps are determined by the binary representations of a_i and t, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, think of t as a possible value that can be reached from a_i by some sequence of operations. Let&#39;s model how to compute the steps required.Another approach: to reach t from a_i, we can perform a series of divide and multiply operations. Let&#39;s see:Suppose a_i is current value. We can:- Divide by 2 (only if even) any number of times.- Multiply by 2 any number of times.But the order matters. For example, if you divide first and then multiply, that&#39;s equivalent to multiplying by 2^k and then dividing by 2^m, but the minimal steps would be the sum of the operations.Wait, but in any case, the steps would be the number of divides plus the number of multiplies. For example, from 4 to 8: multiply once (1 step). From 8 to 4: divide once (1 step). From 4 to 2: divide once (1 step). From 2 to 1: divide once (1 step). From 1 to 2: multiply once (1 step). Etc.So the steps between a_i and t can be found as follows:We can compute the number of times we need to multiply and/or divide to reach t.But how to find the minimal steps.Another idea: for a_i to reach t, the steps would be:If t can be obtained by multiplying a_i by 2^k (i.e., t &gt;= a_i and t is a multiple of a_i and t / a_i is a power of 2), then the steps are k (since you just multiply k times).If t can be obtained by dividing a_i by 2^m (i.e., a_i is divisible by 2^m and t = a_i/(2^m)), then steps are m (dividing m times).Otherwise, perhaps you can first divide a_i to some value, then multiply. For example, a_i=8, t=4. Steps: divide once (1 step). a_i=8, t=2: divide twice (2 steps). a_i=8, t=1: divide three times (3 steps). a_i=8, t=16: multiply once (1 step).But if the target is 4, but a_i is 6. Wait, 6 can&#39;t reach 4 via any number of operations. Because 6 can be divided once to 3 (steps 1), then multiplied by 2 to 6 (steps 2), but 4 is not part of that path. So in that case, the target t must be reachable by all a_i&#39;s. So the possible targets are the intersection of all possible reachable values from each a_i.So the first step is to find all possible targets that are common to all a_i&#39;s possible reachable values.So for each a_i, the set of reachable values is all numbers that can be obtained by multiplying or dividing by 2 any number of times. But how to represent this efficiently.Wait, for a number x, the set of reachable values is all numbers that can be formed by multiplying x by any power of two (positive or negative). But wait, since dividing by two (integer division) is not the same as multiplying by 1/2. For example, 5 divided by 2 is 2. So perhaps for x, the reachable values are generated by first reducing x to its base (the odd number obtained by dividing out all 2&#39;s), then multiplying by 2^m for m ≥ 0. So, for example:x=6 (which is 3*2^1). The base is 3. So the reachable values are 3*2^m, where m can be any integer, but since when m is negative, 3*2^m is not an integer unless m is non-negative. Wait, no. Wait, m can be any integer, but when you divide by two, you can go down until you hit the base. For example, for x=6, the possible reachable values are 3*2^m where m ≥0. So 3, 6, 12, 24, etc. Because 6 can be divided once to 3 (step 1), but you can&#39;t go below 3 since 3 is odd. Then from 3, you can multiply to get 6, 12, etc. But if you have another a_i, like 12, which is 3*2^2. So its base is 3, and reachable values are 3*2^m for m ≥0.So the reachable values for x are all numbers of the form (base) * 2^k, where base is x divided by all possible 2&#39;s (until it&#39;s odd), and k is any non-negative integer (since when you multiply, you can go up as much as you want, but when you divide, you can only go down to the base, then you can&#39;t divide further). Wait, no. Wait, for x=6 (base 3), you can divide once to get 3, then you can&#39;t divide further. Then from 3, you can multiply to get 6, 12, etc. So the reachable values are 3, 6, 12, etc. So k is &gt;=0.So for two numbers to have a common target, their bases must be the same. Because if their bases are different, their reachable sets are disjoint. For example, x=3 (base 3) and y=5 (base5) have no common target. So for all a_i&#39;s to reach a common target, all their bases must be the same. Wait, that&#39;s a key point.Wait, for example, sample input 1: 4,8,2. Their bases:4 → 4/2^2 =1 (base 1, steps 2).8 →8/2^3=1 (base1, steps3).2→2/2^1=1 (base1, steps1).So all bases are 1, so they can reach any 1*2^k. So possible targets are 1,2,4,8,16, etc.Sample input 2: 3,5,6.3 is already odd (base3, steps0).5 is odd (base5, steps0).6→3 (steps1). So bases are 3,5,3. So the common base is none. So there&#39;s no possible target. Wait, but sample input 2&#39;s output is 25. Wait, but how?Wait the sample input 2 given is:33 5 6Sample Output:25. So what&#39;s happening here.Wait, maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem. Let&#39;s see the sample input 3 5 6.Wait, how can those three numbers be made equal?Let&#39;s compute their possible reachable values.3 can be divided by 2 once (since 3 is odd, so can&#39;t divide further. So reachable values are 3,6,12,24,... etc. So steps to reach 3 is 0, 6 is multiply once (1 step), 12 is 2 steps, etc.5 is odd. So reachable values are 5,10,20, etc.6 is even. Its base is 3 (6/2=3). Reachable values are 3,6,12, etc.So how can all three reach a common target?Wait, 3&#39;s reachable: 3,6,12,24,...5&#39;s reachable:5,10,20,...6&#39;s reachable:3,6,12,...So there&#39;s no common target. But according to the sample output, it&#39;s possible. So this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect.Wait, this is a problem. Because according to the sample input 2, the answer is 25. So there must be a way for all three chemicals to reach a common target. So where&#39;s the mistake in my reasoning?Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the reachable values. Let&#39;s check.For a_i=5, the possible operations are: divide by 2 (if possible) or multiply by 2. But since 5 is odd, dividing by two is possible only if it&#39;s even. So 5 is odd, so dividing by two is not allowed. Wait, no. The operation is to choose a chemical and divide its volume by two (integer division), regardless of evenness. Wait, no. Because if you divide an odd number by two, it&#39;s integer division, which would be (5//2)=2. So in that case, you can divide 5 by two once to get 2. Then 2 can be divided again to 1, and then multiplied again.Wait, oh right! So the division is allowed even if the current value is odd. Wait, but the problem statement says: &quot;choose some chemical i and divide its volume by two (integer division)&quot;. So, for example, if the current volume is 5, dividing by two gives 2 (5//2=2). Then that can be divided again to 1, and so on.So my earlier reasoning was wrong. The base is not the odd number you get after dividing by 2 as much as possible. Because even after getting to an odd number, you can continue dividing by two (but that would not give a fraction, but integer division). So the reachable values for any a_i can be any number in the path of dividing by two (any number of times) and then multiplying by two any number of times.Wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify:Each division step takes the current value and divides by two (integer division). So for example, starting with 5:5 → 2 (div by 2, 1 step)2 → 1 (div again, step 2)1 → 0 (div again, which is 0.5 but integer division gives 0, but the problem states that 1 ≤ a_i ≤1e5. Wait, but once you reach zero, can you proceed further? Probably not. Because the problem states that the initial volumes are at least 1. But when you divide a 1 by two, it becomes 0. But after that, dividing zero by two is still zero. But the problem allows you to perform operations even if it&#39;s zero? Hmm, but according to the problem statement, the initial a_i is at least 1, but during the process, the volumes can become zero. So perhaps this is possible.But for this problem, since the target is to make all volumes equal. If one of the chemicals becomes zero, others would have to reach zero. But how?But in the sample input 2, let&#39;s see: chemicals 3,5,6.Let&#39;s see possible paths:3:Possible operations:Multiply by 2: 6 (steps 1), 12 (steps 2), etc.Divide by 2: 1 (step 1), then 0 (step 2), then 0 (steps 3, etc).5:Divide by 2: 2 (step 1), then 1 (step 2), then 0 (step3), etc.Multiply by 2: 10 (step1), 20 (step2), etc.6:Divide by 2:3 (step1), 1 (step2), 0 (step3), etc.Multiply by 2:12 (step1), etc.So possible targets could be 0, but let&#39;s see for all three to reach zero.For 3:3 →1 (div once) →0 (div again: step 2 →0). So steps needed to reach 0: 2 steps (3/2=1, 1/2=0).For 5: 5 →2 →1 →0 (steps 3 steps).For 6: 6 →3 →1 →0 (steps 3 steps).So total steps: 2 +3 +3 = 8 steps. But the sample output is 25, so this is not the case. So perhaps zero is not the target here.Wait, maybe there&#39;s another target that&#39;s possible. Let&#39;s see.Wait, maybe all three can reach 24.Wait, 3&#39;s path to 24: multiply 3 steps (3→6→12→24) →3 steps.5&#39;s path to 24: How?5 → multiply to 10 (step1), 20 (step2), 40 (step3). Then 40 is 40, which can&#39;t be divided to 24.Alternatively, 5 can be divided to 2 (step1), then 1 (step2), then 0.5 (but integer division gives 0). So that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, 5 → multiply once to 10 (step1), then multiply again to 20 (step2), multiply again to 40 (step3). But 40 is not a power of 2 multiplied by 24.Wait, perhaps I&#39;m missing something. Let&#39;s see for the sample input 3,5,6.Sample Input 2:33 5 6Sample Output:25.Hmm, let&#39;s think how to get that.The minimal steps must be 25. So perhaps the target is 6.For 3 to reach 6: multiply once (1 step).5 to reach 6: How?5 → multiply by 2 →10 (step1), then divide by 2 →5 (step2). Not helpful.Alternatively, 5 → divide by 2 →2 (step1), multiply by 2 →4 (step2), multiply by 2 →8 (step3). So steps to reach 8 is 3 steps. But 3 steps for 5 to reach 8. But then 3 would need to reach 8: 3 →6→12→24 → etc. So that&#39;s not possible.Alternatively, perhaps the target is 30.But how would that happen?Wait, perhaps I&#39;m missing a way to reach a common target. Let&#39;s think differently.Each chemical can be transformed into any possible value by a series of operations. So for 3,5,6:Let&#39;s list all possible reachable values and steps for each:For 3:Possible targets (with steps):3:0 steps.6 (3*2):1 step.12:2 steps.24:3 steps.etc.Also, 3/2=1 (step1), 1/2=0 (step2), etc.So possible targets: 3,6,12,24, etc. (steps 0,1,2,3, etc), and 1 (step1), 0 (step2).For 5:Possible targets:5:0 steps.10 (5*2):1 step.20:2 steps.40:3 steps.etc.Also, 5/2=2 (step1), 2/2=1 (step2), 1/2=0 (step3).So targets:5,10,20,40, etc. (steps 0,1,2,3), and 2,1,0 (steps1,2,3).For 6:Possible targets:6:0 steps.3 (6/2: step1), 1 (3/2: step2), 0 (step3).Multiply by 2:12 (step1), 24 (step2), etc.So targets:6,12,24, etc. (steps0,1,2), and 3 (step1), 1 (step2), 0 (step3).So the common targets are:Looking for a value that is present in all three&#39;s possible targets.Looking at 3&#39;s possible targets: 3,6,12,24, 1,0.5&#39;s possible targets:5,10,20, 2,1,0.6&#39;s possible targets:6,3,12, etc., 1,0.So common targets are 0 and 1. Let&#39;s check steps for these.For target 0:3 requires 2 steps (3→1→0).5 requires 3 steps (5→2→1→0).6 requires 3 steps (6→3→1→0).Total steps: 2+3+3=8. But sample output is 25. So that&#39;s not the case.Target 1:3 requires 1 step (3→1).5 requires 2 steps (5→2→1).6 requires 2 steps (6→3→1).Total steps:1+2+2=5. Still not matching sample output.Hmm, this suggests that there&#39;s a mistake in the sample input or my understanding. Wait, sample input 2&#39;s output is 25, but according to this analysis, the answer should be 5. But sample input 2 is given as 3 5 6, and the output is 25. So clearly, my reasoning is wrong.So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.Wait, perhaps the operations are allowed in any order, and the minimal steps for a_i to reach t is the minimal number of operations, which can be a combination of multiply and divide.For example, maybe a certain target can be reached by a combination of up and down steps.Let me re-calculate the steps required for each a_i to reach a target.Let&#39;s take sample input 2: 3,5,6.Sample output is 25. How?What if the target is 15?Let&#39;s see:For 3 to reach 15:3 → multiply by 2 (6) → multiply by 2 (12) → multiply by 2 (24) → but that&#39;s going up. How to reach 15? Wait, 15 is odd, and 3 can reach 3*2^k. 3*5=15, but 5 is not a power of two. So it&#39;s impossible. So 15 is not in the reachable set of 3.Wait, perhaps the target is 24?3 can reach 24 in 3 steps (3→6→12→24).5&#39;s steps to reach 24:5 → multiply by 2 (10) → multiply by 2 (20) → multiply by 2 (40) → then divide by 2 (20) → divide by 2 (10) → divide by 2 (5) → no. This seems not efficient.Alternatively, 5 → multiply to 10 (step1) → multiply to 20 (step2) → multiply to 40 (step3) → divide by 2 to 20 (step4) → divide by 2 to 10 (step5) → divide by 2 to 5 (step6). This is going up and then down again, but the steps are increasing. So the minimal steps for 5 to reach 24 would be impossible, as 24 is not in the reachable values for 5.So this approach isn&#39;t working. So why is the sample output 25?Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps the target is not necessarily a common value in all a_i&#39;s reachable sets, but the way the operations are done allows for a path where all reach that target. But how?Wait, no. Because each a_i must be transformed into the target via the allowed operations. So the target must be reachable by each a_i via some sequence of operations. So all a_i&#39;s must have the target in their reachable sets.So for sample input 2, there must be a common target that all three can reach. But according to previous analysis, the only common targets are 0 and 1. Which gives sum of steps 8 or 5. But sample output is 25. So something is wrong.Hmm, perhaps my analysis of the reachable sets is incorrect.Let me re-examine the possible reachable values for each a_i.For a_i=3:Possible steps:3 can be divided by two (3//2=1) in 1 step. Then multiplied by 2 to get 2, 4, 8, etc.Or, multiplied by 2 to get 6, 12, etc.So the reachable values are all numbers of the form (3*2^k) / 2^m, where k and m are non-negative integers. But that&#39;s not precise. For example, 3 can be divided by two (1) then multiplied by two (2), then divided by two again (1). So the reachable values can be any number that can be formed by a combination of multiplying and dividing by 2.But this is not limited to the base multiplied by some power of two. Because after dividing, you can multiply again. For example, 3 can reach 2 (3 →1 →2). Steps: divide once (3→1), then multiply once (1→2). So steps taken are 2. So 2 is a reachable value for 3 with steps 2.Wait, this changes everything! So the previous assumption that the reachable values are the base multiplied by 2^k is wrong. Because even if the base is 3, you can reach values like 2 by first dividing and then multiplying.So the reachable values are not limited to the base multiplied by 2^k. So how can I model this correctly?Ah, this is the crux of the problem. Each a_i can reach any number that can be obtained by multiplying or dividing by 2 any number of times. But the path can include both up and down steps.So for example:3 can be transformed into 2 via: divide (3→1), then multiply (1→2). Steps: 2.Similarly, 3 can reach 4 via: divide (3→1), multiply three times (1→2→4→8). Steps: 4. Or alternatively, multiply once (3→6), then divide twice (6→3→1.5? No, integer division. 6/2=3, then 3/2=1). Wait, this is getting complicated.Wait, the steps are:Each step is either multiply by 2 or divide by 2 (integer division).So for 3 to reach 4:Option 1: 3 →6 →12 → divide by 2 twice (6 and 3) →3 steps (but this doesn&#39;t reach 4).Option 2: 3 →1 (div once) →2 (mult once) →4 (mult once). Steps:3 steps.So 3 can reach 4 in 3 steps.So 4 is a reachable value for 3. So the reachable values are not just the base multiplied by 2^k. So the previous approach is invalid.This changes everything.So the problem is more complex. For each a_i, the reachable values are all numbers that can be obtained by any combination of multiplying and dividing by 2. But how to model this.This implies that for any a_i, the reachable values are all integers that can be formed by multiplying or dividing by 2, any number of times. So for example, 3 can reach 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. But how?But wait, 3 can reach 2 by dividing once (3→1), then multiplying once (1→2). So 2 is reachable.But 2&#39;s base is 1 (divided once). So for a_i=3, the possible reachable values include numbers that are in the reachable paths of the base (1) multiplied by 2^k.So perhaps for a_i=3, the reachable values are all numbers that are in the set generated by the base (1) multiplied by 2^k, but also the base (3) multiplied by 2^k.Wait, no. Because after dividing 3 to 1, you can multiply to get 2,4,8, etc. So the reachable values are the union of the set generated by 3 (3*2^k) and the set generated by 1 (1*2^k), but also any other bases generated along the way.But this seems complicated. So for each a_i, the possible reachable values can be generated by reducing it to all possible bases by dividing, and then for each base, multiplying by 2^k.But the problem is that during the process of dividing, you can generate multiple bases. For example, 3 can be divided once to 1, which is a base. But 1 can be divided again (but it&#39;s 0.5, integer division gives 0). So the bases are 3 (original), 1 (divided once), 0 (divided twice).But how to model all possible reachable values.Alternatively, each a_i can be represented as a path where each step is either a multiply or divide. The possible reachable values are all integers that can be formed by any number of such operations. But how to efficiently find common targets.But with n up to 1e5, we need an efficient approach.Hmm.Let&#39;s think of each number&#39;s possible reachable values as the union of all possible values obtained by moving up and down.For example, for 3:The possible values are generated by the binary tree:3/   1 (div)     6 (mul)/       / 0 (div) 2 (mul) 3 (div) 12 (mul)and so on.But this is infinite, so we can&#39;t track all possible values.But perhaps for each a_i, we can generate all possible values and the minimal steps required to reach them, and then find a common target with the minimal total steps.But with a_i up to 1e5 and n up to 1e5, this approach is computationally infeasible.So what&#39;s the alternative?Let me think: for each a_i, the minimal steps to reach a target t can be calculated as the number of steps needed to reduce a_i to the greatest common divisor (in terms of power of 2) with t, then multiply or divide to reach t.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are determined by the binary representation of a_i and t.Alternatively, we can model the steps as follows:For any a_i, to reach t, the minimal steps required is the number of times we need to multiply or divide by 2 to reach t. But since we can do any combination of multiply and divide, the steps are the minimal number of operations to reach t.So the steps between a_i and t can be determined by finding the path that requires the least steps. Let&#39;s see.For example, a_i = 3, t=4:Steps: 3 →1 (div, step1) →2 (mul, step2) →4 (mul, step3). So 3 steps.Alternatively, 3 →6 (mul, step1) →12 (mul, step2) → divide by 2 twice (steps3 and4) to 3 →1.5 (no, integer division). Not possible. So the first approach is better.Another example: a_i=5, t=4.Steps: 5 →2 (div, step1) →4 (mul, step2). So 2 steps.So steps can be a combination of dividing and multiplying.So the minimal steps for a_i to reach t is the minimal number of multiply/divide steps required to reach t.But how to compute this.For any a_i and t, the minimal steps can be calculated as follows:1. We can move up and down to reach t. So the steps are the number of times we need to multiply or divide to reach t.But how?We can model this as the minimal number of steps to reach t from a_i, where each step is either multiply by 2 or divide by 2 (integer division).This is similar to BFS, but for large numbers, this is not feasible.Alternative approach:Let’s think of the problem in terms of the binary representations of a_i and t. For example, when you multiply by 2, it&#39;s a left shift. Divide by 2 is a right shift (integer division).But the problem allows any order of shifts. For example, to reach a certain number, you can first left shift, then right shift, etc.But how to find the minimal number of operations.Let’s consider the problem in reverse: what is the minimal number of operations to reach t from a_i.We can think of this as moving from t back to a_i by applying inverse operations. For example, each step can be either multiplying by 2 (if the previous step was dividing by 2) or dividing by 2 (if the previous step was multiplying by 2).Alternatively, for a given t, the possible ways to reach a_i could be determined by whether we multiply or divide.But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, for each a_i and t, the minimal steps can be found by finding the path that goes up and down as needed.For example:We can represent the problem as follows: the minimal steps between a_i and t is the sum of the number of times we need to divide a_i by 2 until we reach a common ancestor, then multiply by 2 to reach t.But this is vague.Wait, let&#39;s take the example of a_i=3 and t=4.The path is 3 →1 →2 →4. Steps:3.Alternatively, 3 →6 →12 →24 →12 →6 →3 →1.5 → no. So that&#39;s not better.So the minimal steps are 3.Let me think of the problem as a graph where each node is a number, and edges are the operations (multiply by 2 or divide by 2). Then, the minimal steps between a_i and t is the shortest path in this graph.But with a_i and t potentially up to 1e5 or higher, BFS is not feasible for each pair.So what&#39;s the pattern here?Alternatively, we can note that the minimal steps between a and t can be computed by:- First, find the largest number that divides both a and t when moving towards each other via multiplying or dividing by 2. Let&#39;s call this number x.Then, the steps required are the number of times we need to divide a by 2 to reach x, plus the number of times we need to multiply x by 2 to reach t.But how to find x.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the path from a_i to t:The steps can be divided into two parts: first, divide a_i as much as possible to reach some intermediate x, then multiply to reach t.Or, multiply a_i to some x, then divide to reach t.The minimal steps would be the minimum over all possible x.But how to find this x.Alternatively, for a_i and t, the minimal steps is the number of steps required to make a_i equal to t by any combination of multiply and divide operations.Let&#39;s consider that the optimal path is to find a common value between a_i and t&#39;s possible paths by moving up or down. For example:For a_i=5 and t=4:The steps are 5 →2 (div once) →4 (mult once). Steps=2.So here, the path is to first divide to a common value (2) then multiply to reach t.The common value here is 2.So the steps are the number of divisions to reach the common value from a_i, plus the number of multiplications from the common value to t.So for a_i and t, the minimal steps is the minimal steps to reach a common value x, then to reach t from x.But how to find x.Alternatively, for a_i and t, the minimal steps can be computed as follows:- Find the largest x such that x can be obtained by dividing a_i by 2^k and multiplying by 2^m, and similarly for t. Or something like that.Alternatively, the minimal steps can be found by bringing both a_i and t to the same value x by dividing or multiplying, then summing the steps for each.But this is vague.Hmm, perhaps the key is to find all possible x&#39;s that can be reached by both a_i and t, then find the x that minimizes the sum of steps from a_i to x and from t to x. But this approach is computationally intensive.Alternatively, for each a_i and t, the minimal steps is the difference in the number of trailing zeros in their binary representations multiplied by 2, but this is just a wild guess.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps between a_i and t is the absolute difference in the number of times you can divide by 2 (the exponents in their prime factorization of 2) plus the difference in the odd parts.But I&#39;m not sure.Let me try to find a pattern.For a_i=3 and t=4:3 is 11 in binary, and 4 is 100. The steps are 3. How to relate this to their binary representations.Alternatively, the minimal steps between a and b can be computed as follows:1. Bring a and b to their odd parts by dividing by 2 as much as possible. If their odd parts are different, then it&#39;s impossible.2. Once the odd parts are the same, the minimal steps is the difference in the number of divisions (k_a and k_b for a and b) plus the difference in the exponents when multiplying back to reach the target.Wait, perhaps this is the way.So, let&#39;s break down a and b into their odd components and exponents of 2.For any number x, we can write x = odd_part * 2^exponent, where odd_part is odd, and exponent is the number of times x can be divided by 2 (exponent is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of x).For example:3 → 3 * 2^0. exponent is 0, odd_part is 3.4 → 1 * 2^2. exponent is 2, odd_part is 1.5 →5*2^0. exponent 0, odd_part 5.6 →3*2^1. exponent 1, odd_part 3.Now, for a and b to be reachable from each other, their odd parts must be the same. Because if the odd parts are different, no amount of multiplying or dividing by 2 will change the odd part. For example, 3 and 5 have different odd parts (3 and5) and are not reachable from each other.But wait, this contradicts the previous example where 3 can reach 1 (odd_part 1) by dividing by 2 once. So the initial reasoning is wrong. So this approach is not valid.Ah, right. Because dividing by 2 can change the odd_part. For example, 3 can be divided by 2 (//2) to get 1 (which has a different odd_part). So the initial idea that the odd_part must be the same is incorrect.This complicates things further.So, this suggests that any number can be transformed into any other number, provided that during the process, we can reach the same value through a series of steps. But this is not necessarily true. For example, 3 can reach 1, but 5 can reach 2, but not sure if there&#39;s a common target.But in the sample input 2, the chemicals are 3,5,6 and the answer is 25. So there must be a common target.Let&#39;s try to find this target.We need to find a target t that can be reached by all three a_i (3,5,6) with minimal total steps.Let&#39;s see how each a_i can reach t.For example, perhaps t is 30.For 3 to reach 30:Steps:3 → multiply by 2 →6 (step1), multiply by 2 →12 (step2), multiply by 2 →24 (step3), multiply by 2 →48 (step4), divide by 2 →24 (step5), divide by 2 →12 (step6), divide by 2 →6 (step7), divide by 2 →3 (step8), divide by 2 →1 (step9), multiply by 2 →2 (step10), multiply by 2 →4 (step11), multiply by 2 →8 (step12), multiply by 2 →16 (step13), multiply by 2 →32 (step14), divide by 2 →16 (step15), divide by 2 →8 (step16), divide by 2 →4 (step17), divide by 2 →2 (step18), divide by 2 →1 (step19), multiply by 2 →2 (step20), multiply by 2 →4 (step21), multiply by 2 →8 (step22), multiply by 2 →16 (step23), multiply by 2 →32 (step24), divide by 2 →16 (step25), etc. This seems way too long. So this is not the right approach.Alternatively, perhaps the target is 15.3 can reach 15: multiply by 2 three times (3→6→12→24 →48. No, that&#39;s not helpful. Or 3 → multiply once 6, divide by 2 →3 (step2), etc. Not helpful.Alternatively, 3 can reach 15 via: 3 → multiply 5 times (3*2^5=96). Then divide by 2 three times (96→48→24→12). No.This isn&#39;t working.Let&#39;s think of the steps required for each chemical to reach a common target.Sample input 2&#39;s output is 25. So the sum of steps for all three must be 25.Let&#39;s see:Suppose the target is 30.For 3:Steps: ?3 → multiply steps to 30.But 30 is 3*10. 10 is not a power of 2. So 3 can&#39;t reach 30 by multiply steps.But perhaps 3 can reach 30 via a combination of multiply and divide steps.For example:3 → multiply by 2 (6) → multiply by 2 (12) → multiply by 2 (24) → divide by 2 (12) → multiply by 2 (24) → multiply by 2 (48) → divide by 2 (24) → divide by 2 (12) → divide by 2 (6) → multiply by 5 (not allowed, as we can only multiply by 2). So no.This approach isn&#39;t working.Perhaps the target is 30 is not possible.Alternatively, perhaps the target is 240.But it&#39;s not clear.Alternatively, perhaps the target is 6.For 3: steps 1 (multiply once).For 5: steps required to reach 6. Let&#39;s see:5 → divide by 2 (2) → multiply by 2 (4) → multiply by 2 (8) → divide by 2 (4) → multiply by 2 (8) → divide by 2 (4) → multiply by 2 (8) → divide by 2 (4) → multiply by 2 (8) → divide by

solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the volumes of all chemicals equal. The allowed operations are doubling the volume or halving it (using integer division).  Approach1. Understand Reachable Values: Each chemical can be transformed into various values through a series of operations. For each value, we can generate all possible reachable values by repeatedly halving (until the value becomes odd) and then multiplying by powers of 2.2. Track Operations: For each possible value that a chemical can reach, we track the number of operations required to reach that value. This includes the steps taken to halve down to the odd base and then the steps to multiply up to the target value.3. Common Target: We need to find a common target value that all chemicals can reach. For each such target, we sum the operations required for each chemical to reach that target and find the minimum sum.4. Efficient Calculation: Instead of generating all possible values for each chemical, we use a dictionary to count the number of times each possible value is reachable by all chemicals and track the total operations required.

Generating Reachable Values: For each chemical, we start from its initial value and repeatedly halve it until we reach zero. For each intermediate value (including the initial value and those obtained by halving), we then generate all possible values by multiplying by 2 and track the number of operations required.2. Tracking Operations: Using a dictionary `value_steps`, we store the number of operations needed to reach each possible value from each initial chemical volume.3. Finding Common Targets: We check all values that can be reached by all chemicals. For each such value, we sum the operations required for each chemical to reach that value and keep track of the minimum sum.This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum operations by leveraging the properties of halving and multiplying, and using dictionaries to track reachable values and their corresponding operations.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-063e3695 data-v-73834811><div class="review" data-v-73834811><div class="review-title" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>❓:</span>Several months later Alex finally got his brother Bob&#39;s creation by post. And now, in his turn, Alex wants to boast about something to his brother. He thought for a while, and came to the conclusion that he has no ready creations, and decided to write a program for rectangles detection. According to his plan, the program detects if the four given segments form a rectangle of a positive area and with sides parallel to coordinate axes. As Alex does badly at school and can&#39;t write this program by himself, he asks you to help him.The input data contain four lines. Each of these lines contains four integers *x*1, *y*1, *x*2, *y*2 (&lt;=-&lt;=109&lt;=≤&lt;=*x*1,&lt;=*y*1,&lt;=*x*2,&lt;=*y*2&lt;=≤&lt;=109) — coordinates of segment&#39;s beginning and end positions.

So the problem is to determine if four given line segments form a rectangle with positive area and sides parallel to the axes. Hmm. So the rectangle must have sides aligned with the x and y axes. That means the sides must be either horizontal or vertical. Also, the area has to be positive, so the length and width can&#39;t be zero. So the rectangle can&#39;t be a line or a point.First, I need to figure out what conditions the four segments must satisfy. Let&#39;s think about the rectangle. A rectangle aligned with the axes has four edges: two horizontal (top and bottom) and two vertical (left and right). Each edge is a line segment. So the four given segments must be these four edges.Wait, but the four segments could be given in any order. So I need to check that there are exactly two horizontal segments and two vertical segments. Also, each horizontal segment should be either the top or bottom edge, and each vertical segment should be the left or right edge.Wait, but each edge is a line segment. For the horizontal edges (top and bottom), their y-coordinates must be the same for both endpoints. Similarly for vertical edges, the x-coordinates must be the same.So first step: check each segment. For each of the four segments, determine whether it&#39;s horizontal, vertical, or neither. If any segment is neither (like a diagonal line), then it&#39;s automatically not a rectangle. So the first condition is that there are exactly two horizontal and two vertical segments.Wait, but each horizontal segment must be a horizontal line (y1 == y2), and vertical must have x1 == x2. So we can categorize each segment as horizontal or vertical. If there are not exactly two of each, then output is NO.But wait, what if a segment is a single point? Like both endpoints are the same. Then it&#39;s both horizontal and vertical. But in that case, the segment is degenerate, and can&#39;t be part of a rectangle with positive area. So if any of the four segments is a single point (length zero), then the rectangle&#39;s edges can&#39;t include that, because the rectangle&#39;s edges must have positive length. Wait, but the problem says the given segments can be degenerate. So maybe the four segments form the edges, but even if some of the input segments are points, as long as when combined they form a rectangle. Wait, no. Because the four edges of the rectangle must each be a line segment with positive length. Otherwise, the area would be zero. So the four segments must each have positive length. Because if any of the edges is a point (zero length), then the rectangle&#39;s area would be zero, which is invalid.Wait, the problem statement says that the rectangle must have a positive area. So all four edges must have positive length. So each of the four input segments must be of positive length. Wait, but maybe the input segments are parts of the edges. Wait, no. The four given segments are supposed to form the edges. So each input segment must exactly correspond to one edge of the rectangle. So each of those four segments must be exactly an edge. So each of those four segments must be a horizontal or vertical line segment of positive length. So the first check is: for each input segment, check whether it&#39;s horizontal (y1 == y2) and x1 != x2, or vertical (x1 == x2) and y1 != y2. If any segment is neither horizontal nor vertical, or if there are not exactly two horizontal and two vertical segments, then it&#39;s invalid.Wait, but what if two horizontal segments are given but they are not the top and bottom edges? Or if the vertical segments are not left and right. Then how to check that they form a rectangle.So after checking that there are exactly two horizontal and two vertical segments, each of positive length, the next step is to check the positions.The rectangle&#39;s four edges would be:- Left vertical edge: x = x_left, y ranges from y_bottom to y_top.- Right vertical edge: x = x_right, y ranges from y_bottom to y_top.- Bottom horizontal edge: y = y_bottom, x ranges from x_left to x_right.- Top horizontal edge: y = y_top, x ranges from x_left to x_right.So the two vertical segments should have x coordinates x_left and x_right, and their y ranges should cover from y_bottom to y_top. Similarly, the two horizontal segments should have y coordinates y_bottom and y_top, and their x ranges should cover from x_left to x_right.So steps to verify:1. Check that there are exactly two horizontal and two vertical segments. Each of the horizontal segments must have y1 == y2 and x1 != x2. Each vertical must have x1 == x2 and y1 != y2.If any of the segments is not horizontal or vertical (like a diagonal), or if counts of horizontal/vertical are not 2 each, output NO.2. For the two horizontal segments: their y-coordinates must be the same for each. Wait, no. Each horizontal segment has a fixed y. But the two horizontal segments should have different y&#39;s, forming the top and bottom. So collect all the y-values of the horizontal segments. There should be exactly two distinct y-values. Similarly, the vertical segments should have two distinct x-values.Wait, no. For the vertical segments, each has a fixed x. So the two vertical segments must be left and right edges, so their x&#39;s should be different. Similarly for horizontal segments.So:Collect the horizontal segments. There must be exactly two. Each has a unique y-coordinate. Then those two y&#39;s must be the min and max (the bottom and top). Similarly, the vertical segments must have two x&#39;s, which are the left and right.But how to ensure that the four segments form a rectangle. Let&#39;s think of the rectangle as defined by left, right, bottom, top. Then:Left is the minimum x among vertical segments.Right is the maximum x among vertical segments.Bottom is the minimum y among horizontal segments.Top is the maximum y among horizontal segments.Wait, but the horizontal segments have y coordinates that are bottom and top. So for the two horizontal segments, their y&#39;s must be bottom and top (so they are min and max, and different). Similarly, the vertical segments&#39; x&#39;s must be left and right (also different, since left &lt; right for positive area).Then, the rectangle&#39;s edges should be:Left vertical edge: x = left, from bottom to top.Right vertical edge: x = right, from bottom to top.Bottom horizontal edge: y = bottom, from left to right.Top horizontal edge: y = top, from left to right.So each of the four given segments must exactly match one of these four edges.So for each of the four input segments, check if it is exactly one of these four edges.So how to check that.So the steps would be:After step 1 (two horizontal, two vertical):Step 2: For the horizontal segments:- Collect all the y-values. There should be exactly two distinct values, say y1 and y2. Let bottom be min(y1, y2), top be max(y1, y2).- For each horizontal segment, check that it spans from left to right. So the x-coordinates for each horizontal segment should start at left and end at right. But the left and right come from the vertical segments.Wait, but the vertical segments have two x-values. Let left be the minimum x, right the maximum x. So vertical segments&#39; x&#39;s are left and right.So for the horizontal segments, each must have x1 and x2 equal to left and right. But the order can vary (since the segment can be given in either direction). So for a horizontal segment, the start and end x&#39;s can be (left, right) or (right, left). But the segment should cover exactly from left to right. So the min and max of x&#39;s in the horizontal segment should be left and right, respectively.Wait, but the horizontal segments should be the bottom and top edges, which span from left to right. So for a horizontal segment (y is bottom or top), its x-coordinates must cover exactly from left to right. So the x1 and x2 must be such that min(x1, x2) == left and max(x1, x2) == right. Otherwise, the horizontal segment is not the entire edge.Similarly, the vertical segments must have y1 and y2 such that min(y1, y2) == bottom and max(y1, y2) == top.So here&#39;s the plan:After step 1:- Collect the x-values of the vertical segments. Let these be x_v1 and x_v2. Then left is min(x_v1, x_v2), right is max(x_v1, x_v2). So the vertical segments must have x equal to left and right.- The vertical segments&#39; y ranges must be exactly from bottom to top. So for each vertical segment, the min(y1, y2) must be bottom and the max must be top. Because the vertical edges (left and right) must run from the bottom to the top.Similarly, the horizontal segments:- Collect the y-values. Let bottom = min(y_h1, y_h2), top = max(y_h1, y_h2).- For each horizontal segment, the x range must be from left to right. So min(x1, x2) == left and max(x1, x2) == right.So steps:1. Check each segment is horizontal or vertical. Count must be two each.2. Collect all horizontal y&#39;s and vertical x&#39;s.3. For vertical x&#39;s: left is min of the x&#39;s, right is max. Check that there are exactly two distinct x&#39;s (so left &lt; right).4. For horizontal y&#39;s: bottom is min, top is max. Check that there are exactly two distinct y&#39;s (so bottom &lt; top).5. For each horizontal segment:   a. Check that the y is either bottom or top.   b. Check that the x-coordinates span from left to right. i.e., the min of x1 and x2 is left, and max is right.6. For each vertical segment:   a. Check that the x is either left or right.   b. Check that the y-coordinates span from bottom to top. min(y1, y2) is bottom, max is top.If all these conditions are satisfied, then output YES. Else, NO.But wait, how to handle the segments. Each input line is a segment. For example, a vertical segment could be (x, y1, x, y2), which is vertical. Then its x is x. So for all vertical segments, collect their x values. There must be two distinct x&#39;s (left and right), and each vertical segment&#39;s x must be either left or right.Similarly for horizontal segments, their y must be either bottom or top.Also, for each vertical segment, the y-coordinates must cover exactly from bottom to top. So when the vertical segment is given, its endpoints can be in any order, but the min and max of their y&#39;s must be bottom and top.Similarly for horizontal segments, the x&#39;s must cover from left to right.So putting it all together:Let&#39;s outline the steps:First, process each of the four segments:For each segment (x1, y1, x2, y2):- Check if it is horizontal: y1 == y2. If yes, and x1 != x2 (since length is positive), then it&#39;s a horizontal segment.- Else, check if vertical: x1 == x2. If yes, and y1 != y2, then it&#39;s vertical.- Else, invalid.So step 1: Check each segment is horizontal or vertical, and has positive length. If any segment is invalid, output NO.If step 1 passes, check that there are exactly two horizontal and two vertical segments.If not, output NO.Then:Collect the x coordinates of the vertical segments. These should be two values (left and right). If there are not exactly two distinct x&#39;s (like if both vertical segments have the same x), then invalid.Similarly, collect the y coordinates of the horizontal segments. These should be two distinct values (bottom and top).If either the vertical x&#39;s are not two distinct or the horizontal y&#39;s are not two distinct, output NO.Then, compute left = min(vertical x&#39;s), right = max(vertical x&#39;s).bottom = min(horizontal y&#39;s), top = max(horizontal y&#39;s).Now, check that each horizontal segment&#39;s y is either bottom or top.If any horizontal segment&#39;s y is not equal to bottom or top, then invalid.For each horizontal segment, check that the x-coordinates span from left to right. That is, min(x1, x2) == left and max(x1, x2) == right.If any horizontal segment doesn&#39;t meet this, invalid.Similarly, for each vertical segment:Check that x is either left or right.Check that min(y1, y2) == bottom and max(y1, y2) == top.If any vertical segment doesn&#39;t meet this, invalid.If all checks pass, output YES. Else, NO.Now, let&#39;s think about the sample input.Sample Input 1:1 1 6 1 → horizontal (y1=1, y2=1). x ranges from 1 to 6.1 0 6 0 → horizontal (y=0). x ranges 1 to 6.6 0 6 1 → vertical (x=6). y ranges 0 to 1.1 1 1 0 → vertical (x=1). y ranges 0 to 1.So vertical segments are x=6 and x=1. Left is 1, right is 6.Horizontal segments have y=1 and 0. bottom=0, top=1.Check horizontal segments:Each horizontal segment&#39;s x must span left (1) to right (6).First horizontal segment: 1→6. So yes.Second: 1→6. Yes.Vertical segments: x must be 1 or 6.Segments 6 0 6 1 → x=6. min y is 0, max is 1. Which is bottom and top.Segment 1 1→1 0 → x=1. min y is 0, max is 1. So yes.So all conditions met. Output YES.Sample Input 2:0 0 0 3 → vertical. x=0, y ranges 0-3. So vertical x is 0.2 0 0 0 → horizontal. y=0. x ranges 0-2.2 2 2 0 → vertical. x=2. y ranges 0-2.0 2 2 2 → horizontal. y=2. x ranges 0-2.So vertical x&#39;s are 0 and 2. left=0, right=2.horizontal y&#39;s are 0 and 2. bottom=0, top=2.Check horizontal segments:First horizontal (2 0→0 0): y=0. x min 0, max 2 → correct.Second horizontal (0→2, y=2). x ranges 0 to 2. Correct.Vertical segments:First vertical (0 0 →0 3). x=0 (left). y ranges 0-3. But bottom is 0, top is 2. So min y is 0, max is 3. Which is greater than top (2). So this segment&#39;s y range is 0-3, which exceeds the top (2). So the vertical segment&#39;s y range must be exactly bottom to top, i.e., 0 to 2. So this check would fail.Thus, output is NO.So the code needs to check for each vertical segment that their min y is bottom and max y is top.In this sample input, the first vertical segment&#39;s max y is 3, which is higher than top (2). So the condition fails.Thus, the code will output NO.So the logic seems to hold.Now, how to implement this in Python.First, read four lines of input, each line is a segment. For each segment, determine if it&#39;s horizontal or vertical.For each segment (x1, y1, x2, y2):Check if it&#39;s horizontal: y1 == y2 and x1 != x2.If yes, add to horizontal list.Else, check if vertical: x1 == x2 and y1 != y2. If yes, add to vertical list.Else, invalid.If after processing all four segments, the counts are not 2 and 2, then output NO.Else:Collect all x&#39;s from vertical segments. There should be two distinct x&#39;s.If not, output NO.Collect all y&#39;s from horizontal segments. Two distinct y&#39;s.Else, output NO.Compute left = min(vertical x&#39;s), right = max.Compute bottom = min(horizontal y&#39;s), top = max.Check:For each horizontal segment:- y must be either bottom or top.- min(x1, x2) must be left.- max(x1, x2) must be right.For each vertical segment:- x must be either left or right.- min(y1, y2) must be bottom.- max(y1, y2) must be top.If all of these are true, output YES. Else, NO.Now, let&#39;s code this.So steps:Read four segments.For each segment:Check if it&#39;s horizontal or vertical.Check counts.If not, output NO.Else:Collect vertical_x = set of x&#39;s of vertical segments.If len(vertical_x) != 2: output NO.horizontal_y = set of y&#39;s of horizontal segments.if len(horizontal_y)!=2: output NO.left = min(vertical_x)right = max(vertical_x)bottom = min(horizontal_y)top = max(horizontal_y)Check:For each horizontal in horizontal_segments:y = horizontal&#39;s y (y1 == y2).if y not in {bottom, top}: invalid.x1, x2 = sorted([x1, x2]) → min and max.if min(x1, x2) != left or max(x1, x2) != right → invalid.For each vertical in vertical_segments:x = vertical&#39;s x (x1 == x2).if x not in {left, right}: invalid.y1, y2 = sorted([y1, y2]).if y1 != bottom or y2 != top → invalid.If all pass, output YES, else NO.Now, code:But wait, in the code, for each vertical segment, we have to check that the min y is bottom and max is top.Wait, for a vertical segment, the endpoints are (x, y1) and (x, y2). The min of y1 and y2 must be bottom, the max must be top.So for each vertical segment, sorted_ys = sorted([y1, y2]).if sorted_ys[0] != bottom → invalid.if sorted_ys[1] != top → invalid.Similarly for horizontal segments: sorted_xs must be left and right.Now, code.So:Read four lines.segments = []for _ in range(4):    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())    segments.append( (x1, y1, x2, y2) )horizontal = []vertical = []for seg in segments:    x1, y1, x2, y2 = seg    if y1 == y2:        # possible horizontal        if x1 != x2:            horizontal.append( (y1, x1, x2) )        else:            # points, but x1 ==x2 and y1 == y2. So zero length.            # which is invalid, since the rectangle must have positive area. So any segment with zero length is invalid.            # wait, the problem says that segments can be degenerate. But in the rectangle, each edge must have positive length.            # So if any of the four segments is a point (zero length), then it&#39;s invalid.            # Because the rectangle&#39;s edges must have positive length.            # So during the initial check, if a segment is horizontal (y1==y2) but x1 ==x2, then it&#39;s invalid.            # So in this case, the code should output NO.            # So during the first check, each segment must be either horizontal (y1 == y2 and x1 !=x2) or vertical (x1 ==x2 and y1 !=y2).            # So for this code, in this case, the code would add to horizontal only if x1 !=x2. Else, invalid.            print(&quot;NO&quot;)            exit()    elif x1 == x2:        # possible vertical        if y1 != y2:            vertical.append( (x1, y1, y2) )        else:            print(&quot;NO&quot;)            exit()    else:        # not horizontal or vertical        print(&quot;NO&quot;)        exit()if len(horizontal) !=2 or len(vertical)!=2:    print(&quot;NO&quot;)    exit()vertical_x = {seg[0] for seg in vertical}if len(vertical_x) != 2:    print(&quot;NO&quot;)    exit()horizontal_y = {seg[0] for seg in horizontal}if len(horizontal_y)!=2:    print(&quot;NO&quot;)    exit()left = min(vertical_x)right = max(vertical_x)bottom = min(horizontal_y)top = max(horizontal_y)# Check horizontal segmentsfor y, x1, x2 in horizontal:    if y != bottom and y != top:        print(&quot;NO&quot;)        exit()    x_min = min(x1, x2)    x_max = max(x1, x2)    if x_min != left or x_max != right:        print(&quot;NO&quot;)        exit()# Check vertical segmentsfor x, y1, y2 in vertical:    if x != left and x != right:        print(&quot;NO&quot;)        exit()    y_min = min(y1, y2)    y_max = max(y1, y2)    if y_min != bottom or y_max != top:        print(&quot;NO&quot;)        exit()print(&quot;YES&quot;)So this code should handle all cases.Testing the first sample input:Sample Input 1:Segments:1 1 6 1 → horizontal (y=1, x1=1, x2=6). So added to horizontal.1 0 6 0 → horizontal (y=0). Added.6 0 6 1 → vertical (x=6, y0 to 1). Added.1 1 1 0 → vertical (x=1, y1 to 0). Added.horizontal_y is {1, 0}, which is two distinct. vertical_x is {6, 1} → left=1, right=6. bottom=0, top=1.Check horizontal segments:First: y=1 (either bottom or top → 0 or 1. 1 is top. yes.x_min =1, x_max=6 → left and right.Second: y=0 (bottom). x1=1, x2=6 → min 1, max 6. Correct.Vertical segments:First vertical: x=6 → right.y ranges from 0 to 1 → min 0 (bottom), max 1 (top). Correct.Second vertical: x=1 (left). y ranges from 0 to 1. Correct.So all checks pass. Output YES.Sample Input 2:Segments:0 0 0 3 → vertical. x=0. y1=0, y2=3. So vertical segment added.2 0 0 0 → horizontal. y=0. x1=2, x2=0. So added.2 2 2 0 → vertical. x=2. y ranges from 0 to 2. Added.0 2 2 2 → horizontal. y=2. x ranges 0 to 2. Added.horizontal has y=0 and 2. vertical has x=0 and 2. So vertical_x is {0, 2} → left 0, right 2. horizontal_y is {0, 2} → bottom 0, top 2.Check vertical segments:First vertical segment: x=0 (left). y1=0, y2=3. min 0, max 3. bottom is 0, top is 2. So max is 3 &gt; 2. So this segment&#39;s y_max is 3, which is invalid. So code will print NO.Yes.So code correctly outputs NO.Another test case: segments that form a rectangle but with overlapping edges.For example:Horizontal segments:(0,0,5,0) → bottom.(0,5,5,5) → top.Vertical segments:(0,0,0,5) → left.(5,0,5,5) → right.All checks pass. Output YES.Another test case: vertical segment&#39;s y doesn&#39;t cover the full bottom to top.E.g.:Left vertical segment has y from 0 to 3. Right vertical from 0 to 3. But top is 5.Then the code will detect that the vertical segments&#39; max y is 3, which is less than top=5. So invalid.So code works.Thus, the code should handle all cases.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if four given line segments form a rectangle with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The key steps involve verifying the segments&#39; orientations, their positions, and ensuring they form a valid rectangle. Approach1. Check Segment Validity: Each segment must be either horizontal (same y-coordinates for endpoints) or vertical (same x-coordinates for endpoints) and have a positive length.2. Count Segments: Ensure there are exactly two horizontal and two vertical segments.3. Determine Edges: For horizontal segments, collect their y-coordinates and determine the bottom and top edges. For vertical segments, collect their x-coordinates and determine the left and right edges.4. Check Span: Each horizontal segment must span from the left to the right edge, and each vertical segment must span from the bottom to the top edge.

Segment Validity Check: Each segment is checked to determine if it is horizontal or vertical. Degenerate segments (points) are rejected immediately.2. Count Check: We ensure exactly two horizontal and two vertical segments are present.3. Edge Determination: The left and right edges are derived from the vertical segments&#39; x-coordinates, and the bottom and top edges from the horizontal segments&#39; y-coordinates.4. Span Check: Each horizontal segment must span from the left to the right edge, and each vertical segment must span from the bottom to the top edge. This ensures all segments form the boundaries of a valid rectangle.This approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the segments form the required rectangle.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-063e3695 data-v-73834811><div class="review" data-v-73834811><div class="review-title" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>❓:</span>During the &quot;Russian Code Cup&quot; programming competition, the testing system stores all sent solutions for each participant. We know that many participants use random numbers in their programs and are often sent several solutions with the same source code to check.Each participant is identified by some unique positive integer *k*, and each sent solution *A* is characterized by two numbers: *x* — the number of different solutions that are sent before the first solution identical to *A*, and *k* — the number of the participant, who is the author of the solution. Consequently, all identical solutions have the same *x*.It is known that the data in the testing system are stored in the chronological order, that is, if the testing system has a solution with number *x* (*x*&lt;=&amp;gt;&lt;=0) of the participant with number *k*, then the testing system has a solution with number *x*&lt;=-&lt;=1 of the same participant stored somewhere before.During the competition the checking system crashed, but then the data of the submissions of all participants have been restored. Now the jury wants to verify that the recovered data is in chronological order. Help the jury to do so.The first line of the input contains an integer *n* (1&lt;=≤&lt;=*n*&lt;=≤&lt;=105) — the number of solutions. Each of the following *n* lines contains two integers separated by space *x* and *k* (0&lt;=≤&lt;=*x*&lt;=≤&lt;=105; 1&lt;=≤&lt;=*k*&lt;=≤&lt;=105) — the number of previous unique solutions and the identifier of the participant.A single line of the output should contain «YES» if the data is in chronological order, and «NO» otherwise.Sample Input20 11 140 11 21 10 240 11 10 10 2Sample OutputYESNOYES</div><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🧠:</span>Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let&#39;s read the problem statement carefully.The problem is about verifying if the recovered data of participants&#39; submissions is in chronological order. Each submission is characterized by x and k. The x represents the number of different solutions sent before the first occurrence of this same solution by participant k. So, for a submission (x, k), there must have been exactly x previous unique solutions from the same participant before this one was sent. And all identical solutions (same code) have the same x. The data is given in chronological order, and we need to check if it&#39;s valid.Hmm. So for each submission (x, k), we need to track how many unique solutions that participant k had before this submission. The x here must be exactly equal to the count of unique solutions that participant k had before this submission. If that&#39;s not the case, then the data is invalid.Wait, but how do we track this? Because each time a new solution is added for a participant, if it&#39;s a new unique solution (i.e., x equals the current count of unique solutions they have), then their unique count increases by 1. Otherwise, if it&#39;s a duplicate (x is less than the current count), then it&#39;s allowed but doesn&#39;t increase the count.Wait, the problem statement says: &quot;each solution A is characterized by x, which is the number of different solutions sent before the first occurrence of A.&quot; So for example, when a participant first submits a solution, x is 0 because there were 0 previous unique solutions. Then, if they submit a different solution (so their unique count becomes 1), then the next time they submit a new unique solution, x would be 1. But if they resubmit the same solution again, x would still be 0 (since the first occurrence was when there were 0 previous).So for each participant k, we need to track two things: the number of unique solutions they&#39;ve submitted so far (let&#39;s call it count[k]), and a map that for each (x, k) pair, the x must be exactly the count[k] at the time of the first occurrence of that solution. Wait, no. Because when a solution is first added, x is equal to the current count of unique solutions for k. Then any subsequent submissions of the same solution must have the same x.So the idea is that for each participant k, each unique solution they submit has an x that&#39;s exactly equal to the number of unique solutions they had before this one. So when they first submit, x is 0 (count starts at 0, then becomes 1). Then, if they submit another unique solution, x is 1 (count was 1 before, so after submission it becomes 2). But if they resubmit the first solution, x is 0 again. So the x in the input must be exactly equal to the number of unique solutions the participant had before the first occurrence of this submission.Therefore, to check the validity, for each submission (x, k) in order:If this is the first time we&#39;re seeing a solution with this x and k:- Then x must be equal to the current count of unique solutions for k. Because this is the first time this solution is being submitted. So when they submit a new unique solution, x should equal the current count.If this is not the first time (i.e., this solution has been submitted before):- Then the x must be exactly the same as it was the first time. But since the x is part of the input, we need to check if the current x matches the stored x for this solution. Wait, no. Because the x in the input is supposed to be the same for all duplicates of the same solution. So for each solution (same code), all submissions after the first will have the same x.Wait, the problem says: &quot;all identical solutions have the same x&quot;. So, for a given solution (same code), x is fixed. So when a solution is submitted again, the x must be the same as when it was first submitted. But how do we track which submissions are duplicates?But the problem is that we don&#39;t have the actual code; we just have the x and k. So for each submission (x, k) in order, the x must satisfy certain conditions based on the previous submissions for participant k.So the approach is:For each participant k, we need to track:1. The number of unique solutions they&#39;ve submitted so far (count_k). This starts at 0 and increases by 1 each time they submit a new unique solution.2. A set or a map that records which x values have been used for their previous unique solutions. Because when they submit a new unique solution, the x must be equal to the current count_k. Then, for any subsequent submission of the same solution (same x and k), x must have been already recorded as a previous unique solution for k.Wait, perhaps we can model this with two dictionaries:- For each k, a dictionary that tracks the current count of unique solutions. Let&#39;s call this &#39;counts&#39;, where counts[k] is the current number of unique solutions for participant k.- For each k, another dictionary that tracks the x values that have been used for their unique solutions. Let&#39;s call this &#39;used_x&#39;, where used_x[k] is a set containing all x values that have been used for k&#39;s unique solutions. Because when a new unique solution is added, x must be equal to counts[k], and then counts[k] is incremented. For a duplicate (non-unique solution), x must already be in used_x[k], and in that case, counts[k] does not change.So, the steps for processing each submission (x, k):- Check if k is in counts. If not, initialize counts[k] to 0 and used_x[k] to an empty set.- Then, for the current x and k:   If x is not present in used_x[k]:      Then, this must be a new unique solution. So, the x must be equal to counts[k]. Because when they submit a new solution, the x should be the number of previous unique solutions. If x is not equal to counts[k], then it&#39;s invalid.      If x is equal to counts[k], then we add x to used_x[k] and increment counts[k] by 1.      Otherwise, it&#39;s invalid.   Else (x is already in used_x[k]):      Then, this is a duplicate of a previous unique solution. So the x is valid (since it&#39;s already part of used_x). In this case, we do not change counts[k] or used_x[k].So, for example:Sample Input 1:20 11 1Processing first submission (0,1):- counts[1] is 0. used_x[1] is empty.- x is 0. Since 0 is not in used_x[1], check if 0 == counts[1] (0). Yes. So add to used_x[1], counts becomes 1.Next submission (1,1):- x is 1, which is not in used_x[1]. Check if 1 == counts[1] (1). Yes. Add to used_x, counts becomes 2.So all valid. Output YES.Sample Input 2:40 11 21 10 2Processing:First submission (0,1): counts[1] is 0. x=0 is not in used_x[1], so check 0 == 0: yes. Add x=0, counts becomes 1.Second submission (1,2): counts[2] is 0. x=1 not in used_x[2]. Check 1 == 0? No. So invalid. So the answer is NO.So output is NO.Third submission (1,1): x=1 not in used_x[1] (which has 0). Check if 1 == counts[1] (1). Yes. Add x=1, counts becomes 2.Fourth submission (0,2): counts[2] is 0. x=0 not in used_x[2]. Check if 0 == 0: yes. Add x=0, counts becomes 1.But the second submission already failed, so the overall answer is NO.Sample Input 3:40 11 10 10 2Processing:First submission (0,1): counts[1] is 0. x=0 is valid. counts becomes 1, used_x[1] {0}.Second submission (1,1): x=1 not in used_x. Check 1 == 1. Yes. Add. counts becomes 2, used_x {0,1}.Third submission (0,1): x=0 is in used_x. So allowed. counts remains 2.Fourth submission (0,2): counts[2] is 0. x=0 is checked against 0. Valid. Add. counts becomes 1.All valid. Output YES.So the approach seems correct.Now, how to implement this in Python?We need to process each of the n submissions in order, and for each (x, k), check the conditions.We can use two dictionaries:- counts: a dictionary where keys are k, and values are the current count of unique solutions for that k.- used_x: a dictionary where keys are k, and values are sets containing the x&#39;s used for unique solutions.So, for each submission:- If k is not in counts, then counts[k] is 0, and used_x[k] is an empty set.- For the current x and k:   if x is in used_x[k]:      proceed (valid, since it&#39;s a duplicate)   else:      if x != counts[k], then invalid (return NO)      else:          add x to used_x[k], increment counts[k] by 1.So, in code:We&#39;ll read n, then read n lines. For each line, process as above.If any line is invalid, we output NO and stop processing further lines.Otherwise, after processing all lines, output YES.Now, considering the constraints: n can be up to 1e5, and k up to 1e5. So, we need an efficient way to handle dictionaries. Python&#39;s default dictionaries should be efficient enough for this.Now, let&#39;s code this.Read n from input.Initialize counts as a defaultdict(int), and used_x as a defaultdict(set).Then for each of the n lines:   read x, k.   Check if x is in used_x[k]:      if yes: continue.      else:          if x != counts[k]: output NO and exit.          else:              add x to used_x[k], and counts[k] +=1.If all pass, output YES.Wait, but counts is a defaultdict(int), so for new k&#39;s, counts[k] starts at 0. So that&#39;s correct.Yes.Testing sample input 1:n=2.First line (0,1):used_x[1] is empty. x not in used_x.Check x (0) against counts[1] (0). Equal. So add to used_x, counts becomes 1.Second line (1,1):x=1 not in used_x. Check 1 == counts[1] (1). Yes. Add, counts becomes 2.All pass. Output YES.Sample 2:n=4.First line (0,1): counts[1] 0. x=0 == 0: added. counts 1.Second line (1,2): counts[2] is 0. x=1 not in used_x[2]. Check 1 == 0? No. So output NO. Stop.Sample 3:Third submission is (0,1), which is already in used_x. So allowed.Fourth submission (0,2):counts[2] is 0. x=0 equals 0. Add. counts becomes 1.All pass. Output YES.Yes.So this code should handle the samples correctly.Now, let&#39;s code it.But need to read from stdin. Also, the code must read the input as per the problem statement.The code should be a function that reads from stdin and prints YES or NO.Wait, but the problem says: &quot;Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt. The function should take stdin as input and print the output. Simply call the function after the definition.&quot;So, the code should be a function that processes the input as described.But in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin.But for efficiency, for large n (up to 1e5), using sys.stdin would be better.But in the code, perhaps:Read all lines at once, then process them.But in Python, for handling 1e5 lines, it&#39;s better to read via sys.stdin.So, the code would be:import sysfrom collections import defaultdictdef check_chronological():    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())    counts = defaultdict(int)    used_x = defaultdict(set)    for _ in range(n):        x, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())        if x in used_x[k]:            continue        else:            if counts[k] != x:                print(&quot;NO&quot;)                return            used_x[k].add(x)            counts[k] += 1    print(&quot;YES&quot;)check_chronological()Wait, but let&#39;s test the sample inputs.Sample 1:Input:20 11 1Processing:Line 1: x=0, k=1.counts[1] is 0. So 0 == 0: yes. Add to used_x[1], counts becomes 1.Line 2: x=1, k=1. counts[1] is 1. So 1 ==1: yes. Add, counts becomes 2.Output YES.Sample 2:Input:40 11 21 10 2Processing first line:k=1, x=0. counts[1] is 0. x not in used. 0 ==0: add, counts becomes 1.Second line: k=2, x=1. counts[2] is 0. x not in used. Check 1 ==0: no. Output NO. Return.Sample 3:Input:40 11 10 10 2Processing:Line 1: k=1, x=0. counts[1] is 0. Add. counts becomes 1.Line 2: x=1, k=1. counts is 1. 1 ==1: add. counts becomes 2.Line3: x=0, k=1. x is in used_x. Skip.Line4: x=0, k=2. counts[2] is 0. x=0 ==0. Add. counts becomes 1. All lines processed. Print YES.Yes.This code should handle these cases.Now, what about a case where a participant has multiple submissions, some duplicates and some new?Like:Sample Input:50 11 10 10 12 1Wait, let&#39;s see:For the fifth submission (2,1):At this point, counts[1] is 2 (after the first two lines). The fifth submission is x=2, which is not in used_x[1] (used_x has 0 and 1). So check counts[1] ==2. x=2 ==2: yes. Add, counts becomes 3. So this is valid.If the fifth line is 1 1, then x=1 is already in used_x, so allowed.But if the fifth line is x=3, then counts is 2. x=3 !=2: invalid.So the code works.Another test case where x is higher than counts.Another possible edge case: x=0, but counts[k] is 0. Which is allowed.If a participant submits x=0 again. For example:30 50 50 5The first submission: counts[5] is 0. x=0: yes. counts becomes 1. used_x has 0.The second submission: x=0 is in used_x. So allowed. counts remains 1.Third submission: same. All allowed. So output is YES.Yes, according to code.Another test case where a participant submits x=0 again but after adding other solutions.E.g.:30 51 50 5First submission: x=0. counts 0: add. counts becomes 1.Second submission: x=1. counts is 1. 1==1: add. counts becomes 2.Third submission: x=0 is in used_x. allowed. So all good.But if the third submission is x=0, but not in used_x (if for some reason, the code allowed that?), but according to code, since x=0 is in used_x, it&#39;s allowed.So code is correct.Thus, the code should handle all cases correctly.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to verify if the recovered data of participants&#39; submissions is in chronological order. Each submission is characterized by two values, x and k, where x represents the number of previous unique solutions submitted by participant k before the first occurrence of the current solution. Our task is to check if the data adheres to the chronological order constraints. Approach1. Understanding the Problem: For each submission (x, k), x must be equal to the number of unique solutions participant k had submitted before the first occurrence of this solution. Subsequent submissions of the same solution must have the same x value.2. Tracking Unique Solutions: For each participant k, we need to track:   - The count of unique solutions they have submitted so far.   - The set of x values corresponding to their unique solutions.3. Validation: For each submission (x, k):   - If x is a new unique solution for participant k, check if x matches the current count of unique solutions. If it does, increment the count and add x to the set of used x values.   - If x is already a known unique solution, it is valid and requires no changes. Solution Code```pythonimport sysfrom collections import defaultdictdef check_chronological():    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())    counts = defaultdict(int)    used_x = defaultdict(set)    for _ in range(n):        line = sys.stdin.readline()        if not line:            break        x, k = map(int, line.strip().split())        if x in used_x[k]:            continue        if counts[k] != x:            print(&quot;NO&quot;)            return        used_x[k].add(x)        counts[k] += 1    print(&quot;YES&quot;)check_chronological()``` Explanation- Reading Input: The input is read using `sys.stdin` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.- Dictionaries for Tracking: Two dictionaries are used: `counts` to track the number of unique solutions per participant and `used_x` to track the x values of unique solutions.- Validation Process: For each submission, we check if x is already a known unique solution. If not, we validate if x matches the current count of unique solutions. If valid, we update the count and track the x value. If any submission is invalid, we immediately print &quot;NO&quot; and exit.This approach ensures that each submission is checked in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for the problem constraints.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-063e3695 data-v-73834811><div class="review" data-v-73834811><div class="review-title" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>❓:</span>Arya has *n* opponents in the school. Each day he will fight with all opponents who are present this day. His opponents have some fighting plan that guarantees they will win, but implementing this plan requires presence of them all. That means if one day at least one of Arya&#39;s opponents is absent at the school, then Arya will beat all present opponents. Otherwise, if all opponents are present, then they will beat Arya.For each opponent Arya knows his schedule — whether or not he is going to present on each particular day. Tell him the maximum number of consecutive days that he will beat all present opponents.Note, that if some day there are no opponents present, Arya still considers he beats all the present opponents.The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *d* (1&lt;=≤&lt;=*n*,&lt;=*d*&lt;=≤&lt;=100) — the number of opponents and the number of days, respectively.The *i*-th of the following *d* lines contains a string of length *n* consisting of characters &#39;0&#39; and &#39;1&#39;.

Hmm. The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive days where Arya beats all present opponents. From the problem statement, I remember that Arya beats them all on a day if at least one opponent is absent. So, if all opponents are present (all &#39;1&#39;s in their schedule for that day), then Arya loses. Otherwise, he wins.So the first thing I need to do is, for each day, determine whether that day is a win for Arya. Then, find the longest consecutive sequence of such days.Let&#39;s break it down. For each day in the d days, check if there&#39;s at least one &#39;0&#39; in the string for that day. If yes, then it&#39;s a win day. If all are &#39;1&#39;s, then it&#39;s a loss. Then, the problem becomes finding the maximum streak of consecutive win days.The steps I need to take:1. Read n and d from input.2. Read d lines of n-length strings. Each line represents a day.3. For each day, check if there&#39;s any &#39;0&#39; in the string. If yes, mark the day as a win (part of the streak). If not, it&#39;s a loss (breaks the streak).4. Track the current streak length and the maximum streak found. Whenever a win day is encountered, increment current streak. If a loss is found, reset current streak to 0. Update the maximum streak each time.Wait, but how about the case when there are multiple consecutive days where Arya wins. Like, the sample input 2 2 gives 10 and 00. For the first day, &#39;10&#39; has a &#39;0&#39; (since opponent 2 is absent?), wait wait, the string is per day, and each character is whether the opponent is present. Oh right, &#39;0&#39; means absent. So for a day&#39;s string, if any &#39;0&#39; is present, that day is a win for Arya.So in the first sample:Day 1: &#39;10&#39; → opponent 1 is present (1?), opponent 2 is absent (0). So since there&#39;s at least one absent, Arya wins.Day 2: &#39;00&#39; → both absent. So he also wins. So consecutive days are 2.Sample output is 2, which matches.Another sample: 4 1, input is &#39;0100&#39;. Wait, n is 4. The day&#39;s string is 0100. So opponent 1 is absent (0?), opponent 2 present (1), others 0. So at least one absent (yes), so it&#39;s a win day. The streak is 1, which is the maximum.Third sample: 4 days. Let&#39;s look at each day&#39;s string:Days 5 in sample input 4 5.Wait sample input 3:4 5So 5 days. The strings are:1101 → let&#39;s check if all are 1&#39;s. No. There&#39;s a 0? Wait the string is &#39;1101&#39; → length 4. Characters are &#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;0&#39;,&#39;1&#39; → so there&#39;s a 0. So this day is a win.Next day: &#39;1111&#39; → all 1&#39;s → Arya loses. So this day breaks the streak.Third day: &#39;0110&#39; → has 0s, so win.Fourth day: &#39;1011&#39; → has a 0? Wait the string is &#39;1011&#39; → no, it&#39;s 1,0,1,1 → yes, there&#39;s a 0. So win.Fifth day: &#39;1111&#39; → all 1&#39;s → lose.So the days&#39; statuses are: win, lose, win, win, lose.The consecutive wins are first streak 1 (day1), then after day2 (loss), days 3 and 4 are consecutive wins. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output.So the plan is correct.Now, how to code this.First, read n and d. Then read d lines. For each line, check if there is any &#39;0&#39; in it. If yes, the day is a win. Else, it&#39;s a loss.Once we have a list of booleans indicating whether each day is a win (True) or loss (False), we can iterate through them and track the current streak and max streak.So the steps in code:Read n and d.Initialize a list &#39;win_days&#39; of length d, each element is True or False.For each day i from 0 to d-1:   s = input().strip()   if &#39;0&#39; in s:       win_days[i] = True   else:       win_days[i] = FalseThen, compute the maximum consecutive True in win_days.So for example, the first sample&#39;s win_days is [True, True], so max is 2.Now, how to compute the maximum consecutive days.Initialize current_streak = 0, max_streak = 0.For each day in win_days:   if day is True:       current_streak +=1       if current_streak &gt; max_streak:           max_streak = current_streak   else:       current_streak = 0So that&#39;s the logic.So putting it all together.Now, code in Python.Read from stdin. So the function needs to read from stdin. Then process, then print the output.Sample code:Read the first line as n, d.Then read d lines, each line is a string.Then for each line, check if there&#39;s a &#39;0&#39;.Compute the streaks.Now, coding that.Wait, but in Python, the input can be read via input() function. However, when multiple lines are present, perhaps using sys.stdin.But the code should read from stdin. So in code:import sysdef main():    n, d = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())    win_days = []    for _ in range(d):        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()        if &#39;0&#39; in s:            win_days.append(True)        else:            win_days.append(False)    max_streak = 0    current = 0    for day in win_days:        if day:            current +=1            if current &gt; max_streak:                max_streak = current        else:            current =0    print(max_streak)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()Wait, but in the third sample input:The days are:1101 → has &#39;0&#39; → True1111 → no → False0110 → has &#39;0&#39; → True1011 → has &#39;0&#39; → True (since &#39;0&#39; is present in the second position)1111 → False.So the win_days list would be [True, False, True, True, False].Then, the streaks are:1 (current becomes 1, max 1), then 0. Then 1, 2 (max becomes 2), then 0. So the max is 2.Which is correct.Yes.Testing sample input 1:2 210 → has &#39;0&#39; → True00 → has &#39;0&#39; → True. So streaks are 1, then 2. Max is 2.Sample input 2:4 10100 → has &#39;0&#39;s → True. Streak is 1. So output is 1.So the code should work.Now, what about edge cases?Case when all days are wins. For example, n=3, d=5. Each day has at least one &#39;0&#39;. Then the max streak is 5.Case when all days are losses. For example, n=3, d=5. Each day&#39;s string is &#39;111&#39;. Then the max streak is 0.Another case: mix of days. For example, some days are wins, some losses.Also, the note says that if no opponents are present, Arya still considers he beats all. So a day with all &#39;0&#39;s is a win day.So code correctly handles that.Another edge case: n=1, d=1. The string is &#39;0&#39; → win → streak 1. If &#39;1&#39; → loss → streak 0.So code should handle that.Yes.So the code should be correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of consecutive days that Arya will beat all present opponents. Arya wins on a day if at least one of his opponents is absent, and he loses if all opponents are present.  Approach1. Input Reading: Read the number of opponents (n) and the number of days (d).2. Determine Winning Days: For each day, check if there is at least one absent opponent (indicated by &#39;0&#39; in the input string). If so, mark that day as a win for Arya.3. Track Consecutive Wins: Iterate through the list of win/loss days to find the maximum streak of consecutive days where Arya wins. Reset the streak counter whenever a loss is encountered.

Reading Input: The first line of input gives the number of opponents (n) and the number of days (d). The subsequent lines each represent a day&#39;s schedule for the opponents.2. Checking for Wins: For each day&#39;s schedule, we check if there is any &#39;0&#39; (indicating an absent opponent). If present, the day is marked as a win.3. Finding Maximum Streak: We iterate through the list of win/loss days, maintaining a count of consecutive wins. If a loss is encountered, the streak is reset. The maximum streak encountered during this iteration is the result.This approach efficiently processes each day&#39;s schedule in linear time relative to the number of days, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(d).</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-063e3695 data-v-73834811><div class="review" data-v-73834811><div class="review-title" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>❓:</span>The year 2015 is almost over.Limak is a little polar bear.

So, the task is to count the numbers between a and b (inclusive) that have exactly one &#39;0&#39; in their binary representation. Hmm, right. So, the first thing I need to figure out is what the binary numbers with exactly one zero look like. Let&#39;s think about that.A binary number with exactly one zero. Since leading zeros aren&#39;t allowed, the number must start with a 1. The only zero in the number can be somewhere in the middle. Wait, but how can we form such numbers?Let&#39;s take some examples. Let&#39;s say the binary is 111101111. That has exactly one zero. So, the structure is a bunch of 1&#39;s, then a 0, then a bunch of 1&#39;s again. Oh right! Because if there&#39;s exactly one zero, then the binary must consist of a block of 1&#39;s, followed by a single 0, followed by another block of 1&#39;s. Or wait, maybe the zero can be anywhere except the leading position. But since leading zeros are not considered, the first digit is 1. So the zero can be in any position after the first, but there&#39;s only one zero in total.So, for a number to have exactly one zero in its binary representation, it must be of the form (2^m -1) * 2^k + (2^k -1), where m and k are positive integers. Wait, let&#39;s think again. Because the number would be something like m 1&#39;s, then a 0, then k 1&#39;s. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a binary number that&#39;s like 111...11011...111, then the total length is m + 1 + k, where m is the number of 1&#39;s before the zero, and k is the number after. But the zero is in the (m+1)th position (if we start counting from 1). So the value would be (2^{m} - 1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) + ( (1 &lt;&lt; k) - 1 ). Wait, let&#39;s see.For example, let&#39;s take m=3, k=2. Then the binary is 111 0 11. So the value is 1110 11 in binary. The first part is (2^3 -1) =7, shifted left by (k+1) positions, which is 3 (since k=2: 0 followed by two 1s). So 7 &lt;&lt; 3 is 56 (111000). Then add (2^2 -1) =3, which is 111. So 56+3=59 (111011). Which has exactly one zero. So the formula would be ( (2^m -1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) ) + (2^k - 1 ). So for each possible pair (m, k), where m &gt;=1 and k &gt;=1, this gives a number with exactly one zero.Wait, but m and k can be different. So to generate all such numbers, we need to iterate over possible m and k values. Then check if the generated number is within [a, b].But the problem is that a and b can be up to 1e18, so we need an efficient way to generate all possible numbers that fit this condition, without iterating through every possible number in the range.So the approach would be to precompute all possible numbers that have exactly one zero in their binary representation, up to 1e18, and then for a given a and b, count how many of these are in the interval.But how many such numbers are there up to 1e18?Each number is determined by the positions of the single zero. Let&#39;s see. For a zero in position i (assuming positions start at 1 for the first digit), but the first digit is always 1. So the zero can be in positions 2 to length of binary number.Wait, for a binary number of length L, the zero can be in any position from 2 to L (since the first digit is 1). For example, in a 3-digit binary number, the zero can be in position 2 or 3.But once we fix the position of the zero, the rest of the digits must be 1&#39;s. Wait no, the digits to the left of the zero must be 1&#39;s (except for the leading 1), but that&#39;s not the case. Wait, the entire number has exactly one zero, so all other digits except that one zero are 1&#39;s. So the binary number must have exactly one zero, and the rest 1&#39;s. So the structure is: a 1 followed by a combination of 1&#39;s and exactly one zero. So the zero can be in any position except the first.So for a number with binary length L, the zero can be in any of the positions 2 to L. So for each possible position of the zero, we can generate the number. Then, we need to generate all such numbers and check if they are within the given [a, b].So the approach is:1. Generate all possible numbers that have exactly one zero in their binary representation. These numbers are formed by taking a binary number of all 1&#39;s and replacing exactly one 1 (except the first) with a 0.But how to generate them efficiently?Alternative approach: For a number to have exactly one zero, it&#39;s equivalent to the binary representation being (binary) 1 followed by some 1&#39;s, then a zero, then some more 1&#39;s. So the number is of the form (2^m -1) * 2^k + (2^k -1), where m &gt;=1, k &gt;=1. Wait, maybe m is the number of 1&#39;s before the zero, and k is the number of 1&#39;s after. So the binary is m 1&#39;s, followed by a 0, followed by k 1&#39;s. Then the total length is m+1 +k.But wait, let&#39;s see for m=1, k=1: the number is 1 0 1, which is 5. So (2^1 -1) is 1. Shifted left by k+1 (1+1=2) gives 4. Then add (2^1 -1) =1: 5. Correct.Another example: m=2, k=3. 11 0 111. Which is 1000 + 111 = 1111 in binary, which is 15 + 7 = 22. Wait, 110111 is 55 in decimal. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the formula.Wait, the binary number is m 1&#39;s, then a 0, then k 1&#39;s. So the total length is m + 1 + k. The value would be ( (2^{m} -1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) ) ) + (2^{k} -1 ). Let&#39;s see for m=3, k=2:(2^3 -1) is 7. Shift left by (2+1) =3: 7&lt;&lt;3 is 56. Then add (2^2 -1)=3: 59. Which is 111011, which is correct.Yes, that formula works. So the numbers are generated by varying m and k, where m is the number of 1&#39;s before the 0, and k is the number of 1&#39;s after. Both m and k must be at least 1. Because, if k is zero, then after the zero there are no 1&#39;s, but the zero is the last digit. So the number would be m 1&#39;s followed by a zero, but then the number would be even, which in binary has a trailing zero. But that&#39;s allowed as long as there&#39;s exactly one zero. For example, m=2, k=0: binary is 110. But k can&#39;t be zero in our formula. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the number must have exactly one zero. So the zero can be anywhere except leading.So in the case where the zero is the last digit (k=0), then the binary is 110, which is 6. It has exactly one zero. So perhaps k can be zero. Wait, but the formula as written earlier requires k &gt;=1. So maybe our initial approach is missing some numbers where k is zero.Hmm, this is a problem. Let&#39;s think again.The zero can be anywhere except the first digit. So the zero can be in the middle, or the end, or the second digit, etc. So for example:- 110 (6) has exactly one zero. So m=2 (two 1&#39;s before the zero), then zero, then zero 1&#39;s. So k=0.Similarly, 101 (5) is 1 0 1, which has m=1, k=1.So the general case is that the binary is composed of m 1&#39;s, followed by a zero, followed by k 1&#39;s. m &gt;=1, k &gt;=0. Because k can be zero, which means the zero is at the end.So the formula would then be (2^{m} -1) &lt;&lt; (k +1) ) + (2^{k} -1 ), but when k is zero, the second part is 0. So for k=0, the number is (2^m -1) * 2, which is 2*(2^m -1) = 2^{m+1} -2. Let&#39;s see for m=2, k=0: 2^2-1 is 3. Shift left by 1 (k+1=1) is 6. Add (2^0 -1) = 0. So 6, which is 110. Correct.So for numbers where the zero is at the end (k=0), they are of the form 2^{m+1} -2.So in our formula, m can be &gt;=1 and k can be &gt;=0. So the possible pairs (m, k) are m &gt;=1, k &gt;=0.But then how to generate all possible numbers for all m and k where m &gt;=1 and k &gt;=0.The problem now is that m and k can vary, and we need to generate all possible numbers that fit the pattern, then check which fall into the [a, b] interval.But the numbers can be up to 1e18. So how many such numbers are there? Let&#39;s see.For each possible position of the zero in the binary number. The zero can be in any position except the first. So for a binary number of length L, the zero can be in positions 2 to L. For each possible position, the number of possible numbers is the number of ways to have a zero at that position, with all other digits (except the first) being 1&#39;s.Wait, no. The binary number must have exactly one zero, which is at a certain position, and all other digits (except the leading 1) are 1&#39;s.So for example, for a zero at position i (i &gt;=2), the binary number is formed by 1 followed by (i-2) 1&#39;s, a 0, and then (length - i) 1&#39;s. But the length can vary. So for each position i, there are multiple numbers possible. For example, position i=2 can be part of a number of length 3, 4, etc.Alternatively, perhaps each possible zero position (after the first) can generate numbers in the form where before the zero there are (i-2) 1&#39;s (since the first digit is 1, and the zero is at position i), and after the zero, any number of 1&#39;s. Wait, no. Let&#39;s think:If the zero is at position i (the first digit is position 1), then the digits before the zero (positions 1 to i) are 1 followed by (i-2) 1&#39;s and a 0. Wait, no: the digits from 1 to i-1 are 1&#39;s, then a 0 at position i. Then the rest (positions i+1 onwards) are 1&#39;s. So the binary number is:1 followed by (i-2) 1&#39;s, then 0, then (k) 1&#39;s, where k &gt;=0.So for example, if i=2, then the binary is 1 0 followed by k 1&#39;s. So for k=0, it&#39;s 10 (2), which is allowed. So the numbers here would be 2, 3 (101 is 5? Wait, no. Wait, for i=2, the zero is in position 2. The digits after can be any number of 1&#39;s. So for i=2 and k=0: 10, which is 2. For i=2 and k=1: 101, which is 5. For i=2 and k=2: 1011, which is 11, etc.So for each possible i (starting from 2), and k &gt;=0, the number is formed by 1 followed by (i-2) 1&#39;s, then 0, then k 1&#39;s. But how to model this.Alternatively, for a zero at position i, the number can be written as (2^{i-1} -1) &lt;&lt; (k + 1) + (2^k - 1). Wait, perhaps not. Let&#39;s see:The part before the zero is 1 followed by (i-2) 1&#39;s. So the value of the part before the zero (including the zero) is 2^{i-1} -1 - 2^{i-2} ? No, maybe not. Let&#39;s take i=2. The part before the zero is 1, then zero. So that&#39;s 10 in binary, which is 2. Which is 2^1 (since i=2: 2^ (i-1) ) = 2^1=2. Then shifting by k 1&#39;s. So the total is 2 &lt;&lt; k, but then add (2^k -1). Wait, for k=0: 2 &lt;&lt;0 is 2, add 0: 2. For k=1: 2 &lt;&lt;1 is4, add 1:5 (101). For k=2: 4&lt;&lt;1 is 8, add 3: 11 (1011). So yes, this seems correct.So the formula for a zero at position i (i &gt;=2) and k 1&#39;s after the zero is ( (2^{i-1} -1) &lt;&lt; (k + 1) ) ) + (2^k -1). Wait, for i=2, the part before the zero is 10, which is 2. So 2^{i-1} is 2^1=2. 2^{i-1} is 2. So 2 -1=1. Then shifting by (k+1) gives 1&lt;&lt;(k+1) = 2^{k+1}. Then adding (2^k -1) gives 2^{k+1} + 2^k -1 -1? Wait, let&#39;s compute for i=2, k=1: (2^1 -1) =1. shift left by 2 (k+1=2) → 4. add 1 (2^1 -1=1) → 5. Which is correct.So this formula works. So for each i (i &gt;=2) and k &gt;=0, the number is ( (2^{i-1} -1) ) &lt;&lt; (k+1) + (2^k -1 ). But how can we generate all possible such numbers efficiently?The problem is that for i and k up to a certain maximum, such that the generated number is &lt;=1e18.But the maximum possible i and k would be when 2^{i-1} is as large as possible. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible numbers that fit the pattern by iterating over possible m and k (m = number of 1&#39;s before the zero, which is (i-1) since i is the position of the zero. So for position i, m = i-1). Then k is the number of 1&#39;s after the zero. So for m &gt;=1 (since i &gt;=2 → m = i-1 &gt;=1), k &gt;=0.So the number is ( (2^m -1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) ) + (2^k -1 )So for example, m=1 (i=2), k=0 → (1 &lt;&lt;1) +0 →2.m=1, k=1 → (1 &lt;&lt;2) +1 →4+1=5.Yes.So the formula is correct. So the numbers are generated by varying m and k, where m &gt;=1 and k &gt;=0.So our approach should be to generate all numbers in this form, check if they are within a and b, and count them.But how to generate all possible (m, k) pairs such that the generated number is &lt;=1e18.But m and k can be up to log2(1e18) which is about 60. So for each m from 1 to 60, and for each k from 0 to 60, compute the number and check if it&#39;s within the a and b.Wait, but for each m, how many k&#39;s are possible? For example, for m=1:number = (2^1 -1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) + (2^k -1 ) → (1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) + (2^k -1) → 2^{k+1} + 2^k -1 = 3*2^k -1.So for m=1, the numbers are 3*2^k -1. So for k=0: 3*1 -1=2, k=1:5, k=2: 11, etc. Each such number is of the form 3*2^k -1. So for each m, we can compute the maximum possible k such that the number is &lt;=1e18.But since 1e18 is up to 2^60, for each m, the maximum k could be up to around 60.So the plan is:- For each possible m from 1 to 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18), and for each possible k from 0 to 60, compute the number. Then check if the number is within [a, b].But even with m up to 60 and k up to 60, that&#39;s 60*60=3600 possibilities. Which is manageable.But how to avoid duplicates? For example, could a number be generated by multiple (m, k) pairs?For example, let&#39;s see:Is there any number that can be represented in more than one way? Let&#39;s take 21: binary 10101. Which would have two zeros. Wait no, 10101 has two zeros. So it&#39;s not in our list. So the numbers generated by our method have exactly one zero. So each generated number is unique. But can two different (m, k) pairs generate the same number?For example, m=2, k=1:(2^2-1) is 3. Shift left by (1+1) =2 → 3&lt;&lt;2=12. Add (2^1 -1)=1 →13. Binary 1101. Which has a zero in position 3 (counted from left, 1-based index). So m=2 (which is for position i= m+1? Wait, m is the number of 1&#39;s before the zero. So for m=2, the zero is after two 1&#39;s. So the zero is at position 3. Then k=1 is the number of 1&#39;s after.Another example: m=1, k=2: 3*2^2 -1 = 11 (binary 1011). Zero in position 2.Another possible (m, k) pair that generates 13: Is there any?Hmm, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s take m=3, k=0. The formula gives (2^3-1) &lt;&lt; (0+1) + (2^0-1) →7 &lt;&lt;1 +0 →14. So 14 is 1110. So no. So 13 is generated by (m=2, k=1). Are there any other pairs that generate 13? Let&#39;s see:Suppose m=1, k=2: 3*2^2 -1 =12-1=11. Not 13.m=3, k=0:14.m=2, k=1:13.Another example, m=3, k=1: (2^3-1)&lt;&lt;2 + (2^1-1) →7*4 +1= 29. Binary 11101. Which has one zero.So it seems that each (m, k) pair generates a unique number. Because the binary representation for each pair is unique in terms of the position of the zero and the number of 1&#39;s after. So the numbers generated by different (m, k) pairs are distinct.Thus, generating all possible (m, k) pairs and checking their numbers is safe and will not produce duplicates. So the approach is:1. Enumerate all possible m and k pairs where m &gt;=1, k &gt;=0.2. For each pair, compute the number using the formula: num = (2^m - 1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) | (2^k - 1)3. Check if the number is between a and b.4. Count how many such numbers are in the interval.But wait, what about the order in which m and k are generated? For example, when m increases, the numbers can get larger, but varying k can also affect the size. However, since we are generating all possible m and k up to 60, which covers up to 2^60, which is about 1e18, we can capture all possible numbers.Now, the problem is how to compute the numbers without overflow. Since Python handles big integers well, we don&#39;t have to worry about that.So the steps in code:- Iterate m from 1 to 60.- For each m, compute (2^m -1). Let&#39;s call this part1.- Then, iterate k from 0 to 60.- For each k, compute part2 = (2^k -1).- Then, compute the number as (part1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) + part2.Wait, but (part1) &lt;&lt; (k+1) is equivalent to part1 multiplied by 2^(k+1). So part1 is (2^m -1), multiply by 2^{k+1} → (2^m -1) * 2^{k+1}, then add part2 (2^k -1).Yes.But when m and k are up to 60, 2^60 is manageable in Python.So code outline:count = 0for m in range(1, 61):    part1 = (1 &lt;&lt; m) - 1    max_k = 60  # arbitrary high limit, but adjust to avoid overflow beyond 1e18    for k in range(0, 61):        shift = k + 1        part2 = (1 &lt;&lt; k) - 1        num = part1 * (1 &lt;&lt; shift) + part2        if a &lt;= num &lt;= b:            count +=1But wait, what&#39;s the maximum possible m and k that could generate a number &lt;=1e18?We need to find for each m, the maximum k such that the number is &lt;=1e18.But since 1e18 is approximately 2^60 (since 2^60 is about 1.15e18), for m up to 60, but even then, for higher m, the possible k is smaller.For example, m=60:part1 is (2^60 -1). When k=0, the number is part1 * 2^(0+1) + (2^0 -1) → (2^60 -1)*2 +0 = 2^61 -2. Which is way larger than 1e18. So for m=60, even k=0 gives a number larger than 1e18. So in practice, m can&#39;t be up to 60. So perhaps we need to find for each m the maximum possible k that allows the number to be &lt;= 1e18.Alternatively, for each m from 1 upwards, and while part1 is &lt;=1e18, compute possible k&#39;s.But how to compute the upper bounds for m and k.Alternatively, for m, the maximum possible is when part1 is as small as possible, but even then, the shifts for k+1 could lead to numbers beyond 1e18. So perhaps for m up to 60 is overkill. But even so, 60 is manageable.But in practice, for m from 1 to 60, and k from 0 to 60, the numbers can be up to (2^60 -1)*2^(61) + (2^60-1), which is way larger than 1e18. So we need to avoid generating numbers that are too big. So the code should check if the generated number exceeds 1e18, and break early for k once the number is too big.So the code can be optimized as follows:count = 0max_num = 1018for m in range(1, 61):    part1 = (1 &lt;&lt; m) -1    # Compute for k starting from 0 until the number exceeds b.    for k in range(0, 61):        shift = k +1        part2 = (1 &lt;&lt; k) -1        num = part1 * (1 &lt;&lt; shift) + part2        if num &gt; max_num:            break  # since higher k will produce even larger numbers        if a &lt;= num &lt;= b:            count +=1But even this is not entirely correct. For example, for some m and k, the generated number may be larger than 1e18 even before k reaches 60. So, in the code, during the loop over k, once num exceeds 1e18, we can break the loop for that m.Wait, but the problem is that the numbers may not be generated in order for different k&#39;s. For example, for a fixed m, when k increases, the shift increases by 1, so part1 * 2^(shift) increases exponentially. part2 also increases exponentially but with a smaller base. So for a fixed m, as k increases, the generated number increases. So once for a certain k, the number exceeds 1e18, then higher k will generate even larger numbers. So for each m, we can break the k loop once num exceeds 1e18.But wait, the code is checking a and b. So perhaps, even if the number is larger than 1e18, if the upper bound is 1e18, but the user input may have a and b up to 1e18. So to avoid generating numbers beyond 1e18, the code can break when the generated number exceeds 1e18.But the user input a and b can be up to 1e18, so the code must generate all possible numbers up to 1e18. So the code can precompute all numbers up to 1e18 and then for a query, count how many are in [a, b].But in Python, even generating all possible (m, k) pairs and then checking if the number is &lt;=1e18 is manageable, since there are only 60*60=3600 possibilities.So the code can generate all possible numbers, filter those &lt;=1e18, and then for each query, count how many are in [a, b].But the problem requires that the code reads a and b from stdin, and output the count. So the code must process the input, generate all possible valid numbers (&lt;=1e18 and with exactly one zero), and count how many are in the interval.But generating all possible numbers first for each test case may be time-consuming. However, given that the maximum number of valid numbers is around 3600 (since 60*60=3600), this is acceptable.So the steps for the code:1. Precompute all valid numbers (with exactly one zero in binary) up to 1e18.But how? Because in the code, we can generate all possible (m, k) pairs, compute the number, check if it is &lt;=1e18, and collect them in a list. Then, for each test case, sort this list and use binary search to find the count in [a, b].Wait, but for the code to handle multiple test cases, this approach would be efficient. However, in the problem statement, it seems that the code must process a single test case (since the input is two integers a and b). So the code can generate all possible numbers once, then check for each input how many are in the interval.But generating all possible numbers once per function call is manageable.So the code can be structured as follows:Generate a list of all valid numbers (those with exactly one zero in binary) up to 1e18. Then, for the input a and b, count how many numbers in this list are between a and b inclusive.So first, generate the list.Let&#39;s see how many numbers are in this list. For example:For each m from 1 to 60:    compute part1 = 2^m -1    for k from 0 to ... until part1 * 2^(k+1) + (2^k -1) &lt;=1e18.But how to compute the maximum k for each m.But perhaps a better way is to generate all possible (m, k) pairs, compute the number, and add to the list if it&#39;s &lt;=1e18.Once all numbers are generated, sort the list and remove duplicates (but earlier analysis suggests that each pair (m, k) produces a unique number, so duplicates shouldn&#39;t exist).Once the list is sorted, for each query, perform a binary search to find the lower and upper bounds and count.But in the code, for each function call (processing one a and b), generating the list each time may be time-consuming. So precomputing the list once is better.But in Python, the code is called once per run. So the code can precompute all the valid numbers once, sort them, and then for the input a and b, use binary search to find the count.Yes. So the steps in code:- Precompute the list of valid numbers.- Sort the list.- Read a and b.- Use bisect to find the first index &gt;= a and the last index &lt;= b, then the count is right_idx - left_idx +1.So let&#39;s see.First, generate all valid numbers.valid_numbers = []for m in range(1, 61):    part1 = (1 &lt;&lt; m) - 1    # Compute part1 for this m.    # Now iterate k from 0 upwards until the number exceeds 1e18.    for k in range(0, 61):        shift = k +1        part2 = (1 &lt;&lt; k) - 1        num = part1 * (1 &lt;&lt; shift) + part2        if num &gt; 1e18:            break        valid_numbers.append(num)# Remove duplicates (if any) and sort.valid_numbers = sorted(list(set(valid_numbers)))Then, for a and b:import bisectleft = bisect.bisect_left(valid_numbers, a)right = bisect.bisect_right(valid_numbers, b)count = right - leftprint(count)But wait, how many numbers are generated? Let&#39;s see for some small m and k.For m=1:k can range from 0 to as long as 3*2^{k+1} -1 &lt;=1e18.Wait, part1 is 1 for m=1. So part1 is 1. Then, num is 1 &lt;&lt; (k+1) *1 + (2^k -1). Which is 2^{k+1} + 2^k -1 = 3*2^k -1.So for k=0: 3*1 -1=2.k=1: 3*2-1=5.k=2: 3*4 -1=11.k=3: 3*8-1=23....This continues until 3*2^k -1 &lt;=1e18. Let&#39;s solve for k:3*2^k &lt;=1e18 +1 → 2^k &lt;= (1e18+1)/3 ≈ 3.33e17 → k &lt;= log2(3.33e17) ≈58. So for m=1, k can go up to 58.But in the code, the loop for k is up to 60. So in that case, for m=1, when k exceeds 58, the num will be 3*2^59 -1 ≈3*5.76e17=1.7e18, which is larger than 1e18. So the code will break the loop once the number exceeds 1e18.Thus, for each m, k can be up to a certain value. The code&#39;s loop for k up to 60 is sufficient, since beyond that, the numbers would be larger than 1e18, and the code will break.So, after generating all valid numbers, the code can sort them and use binary search for each query.But for the sample inputs:Sample Input 1:5 10 → valid numbers are 5 (101), 6 (110), 9 (1001). Wait, but according to the code:For m=1, k=1 →3*2^1 -1=5. m=2, k=0 → (3) &lt;&lt;1 →6. m=1, k=2 →3*4-1=11&gt;10. m=2, k=1 → (3) &lt;&lt;2 +1 →12 +1=13&gt;10. So in the interval 5-10, the numbers are 5,6,9? Wait, wait what about 9.Wait 9 is 1001. That&#39;s two zeros. Oh wait no, 1001 has two zeros. So no. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Wait, how does 9 get into the list?Wait, 9 is 1001. That has two zeros. So it&#39;s not a valid number. So according to the code, numbers like 9 are not generated.Wait, but according to the code, for m=3, k=0 → part1=7 (111), shift=0+1=1. So part1 &lt;&lt;1 →14. part2=0. So 14 +0=14. So 14 is 1110.So why does the first sample input have output 2 (5 and 6)?Sample Input 5-10: the valid numbers are 5 (101), 6 (110), which are two numbers. So the output is 2. Which matches the sample.But what about 9? Let&#39;s see why 9 isn&#39;t generated.Looking for numbers with exactly one zero. 9 is 1001. Two zeros, so it&#39;s not valid.So the code will not generate 9.So sample input 1&#39;s output is 2, which is correct.Sample Input 2:2015 → which is 11111011111. Which has one zero. So code should generate it. So output is 1.Sample Input 3:100-105. Let&#39;s see what numbers are generated in this range.Looking for numbers between 100 and 105.For example:m=3, k=2: part1=7, shift=3 (k+1=3). 7&lt;&lt;3 =56. part2=3 (2^2-1). 56+3=59 →111011.59 is in 100-105? No, 59 is below 100.m=4, k=0: part1=15, shift=1 →15*2=30 →30. No.m=2, k=3 → part1=3, shift=4 →3&lt;&lt;4=48, part2=7 (2^3-1). 48+7=55. No.m=3, k=3: 7&lt;&lt;4=112, part2=7. 112+7=119. Which is 1110111 (binary). Which has one zero. So 119 is in 100-105? No, 119 is larger than 105.So between 100 and 105, there are no numbers with exactly one zero. Hence sample output is 0.Sample Input4:72057594000000000 72057595000000000 → output 26.But how to verify that.But the code will generate all possible numbers, so for each query, it can count them.Now, the code should generate the numbers correctly.So the code steps are:1. Precompute all valid numbers with exactly one zero in their binary representation, up to 1e18.2. Sort them.3. For the input a and b, count how many of these numbers are in [a, b].Thus, the Python code can be written as:import bisectdef generate_valid_numbers():    valid = []    max_limit = 1018    for m in range(1, 61):        part1 = (1 &lt;&lt; m) - 1        for k in range(0, 61):            shift = k + 1            part2 = (1 &lt;&lt; k) - 1            num = part1 * (1 &lt;&lt; shift) + part2            if num &gt; max_limit:                break            valid.append(num)    valid = sorted(list(set(valid)))    return validvalid_numbers = generate_valid_numbers()a, b = map(int, input().split())left = bisect.bisect_left(valid_numbers, a)right = bisect.bisect_right(valid_numbers, b)print(right - left)Wait, but this code may have duplicates. Earlier analysis suggests that each (m, k) pair generates a unique number, but perhaps there are cases where different pairs generate the same number. For example, m=2, k=1 and m=1, k=2.Wait, m=2, k=1: part1=3, shift=2 →3*4=12. part2=1. 12+1=13 →1101.m=1, k=2: part1=1, shift=3 →1*8=8. part2=3 →8+3=11 →1011. So different numbers.Another example: m=3, k=0 →7 &lt;&lt;1 =14 →14+0=14 (1110).m=2, k=1 →3&lt;&lt;2=12 +1=13 (1101).So no duplicates. So the set conversion may not be needed, but adding it is safe.But to confirm, perhaps some numbers can be generated by multiple (m, k) pairs. For example:Is there any number that can be written as (2^m -1)*2^{k+1} + (2^k -1) in more than one way?Suppose such a number exists. Let&#39;s say for (m1, k1) and (m2, k2), the numbers are the same.But this seems unlikely. For example, if m and k are different, the position of the zero would be different, leading to different binary representations.But I&#39;m not sure. So adding &#39;set&#39; in the code to avoid duplicates is safe.But according to the sample inputs, for example, the first sample generates 5 and 6, which are generated by (m=1, k=1) and (m=2, k=0), respectively. These are two distinct numbers. So no duplicates.But perhaps there is a case where two pairs generate the same number. Let&#39;s check.For example, m=4, k=0: part1=15, shift=1 →15*2=30. part2=0. 30.m=3, k=1: part1=7, shift=2 →7*4=28. part2=1. 28+1=29.No. So no duplicates.Another example: m=2, k=2. part1=3, shift=3 →3*8=24. part2=3 →27.m=3, k=0:7*2=14 +0=14. No.m=1, k=3: part1=1, shift=4 →1*16=16. part2=7 →23.No.So perhaps there are no duplicates. So the &#39;set&#39; conversion may not be needed, but it&#39;s safe to leave it in.Thus, the code is correct.Testing the sample inputs:Sample Input 5 10:The valid numbers are 5,6. So output is 2.Sample Input 2015 2015:2015 in binary is 11111011111. Which has one zero. So the code would have generated this number. So output 1.Sample Input 100 105:No numbers between 100 and 105. Output 0.Sample Input 4: the code should output 26.Thus, the code should work.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of years within a given interval [a, b] that have exactly one &#39;0&#39; in their binary representation.  Approach1. Understanding the Binary Pattern: A number with exactly one &#39;0&#39; in its binary representation must be of the form `1^m 0 1^n`, where `1^m` denotes m consecutive 1&#39;s, followed by a single 0, and then n consecutive 1&#39;s. This translates to the formula: `(2^m - 1) * 2^(n+1) + (2^n - 1)` where m &gt;= 1 and n &gt;= 0.2. Generate Valid Numbers: Precompute all valid numbers up to 10^18 using the formula mentioned. This involves iterating over possible values of m and n (up to 60 each, as 2^60 is slightly more than 10^18).3. Efficient Query Handling: Store the precomputed numbers in a sorted list. For each query, use binary search to count how many of these numbers fall within the interval [a, b]. Solution Code```pythonimport bisectdef generate_valid_numbers():    valid = []    max_limit = 1018    for m in range(1, 61):        part1 = (1 &lt;&lt; m) - 1        for k in range(0, 61):            shift = k + 1            part2 = (1 &lt;&lt; k) - 1            num = part1 * (1 &lt;&lt; shift) + part2            if num &gt; max_limit:                break            valid.append(num)    valid = sorted(list(set(valid)))  # Remove duplicates and sort    return validvalid_numbers = generate_valid_numbers()a, b = map(int, input().split())left = bisect.bisect_left(valid_numbers, a)right = bisect.bisect_right(valid_numbers, b)print(right - left)``` Explanation1. Generating Valid Numbers: The function `generate_valid_numbers` precomputes all numbers up to 10^18 that fit the required binary pattern. This is done by iterating over possible values of m (from 1 to 60) and n (from 0 to 60), calculating the corresponding number using the formula and checking if it exceeds the limit.2. Handling Queries: Once all valid numbers are generated and sorted, for each input interval [a, b], binary search (via `bisect_left` and `bisect_right`) efficiently counts how many numbers lie within the interval. This approach ensures that each query is handled in logarithmic time relative to the number of valid numbers, which is efficient even for large ranges.This method ensures that we precompute the necessary values once and handle each query efficiently, making the solution both time and space efficient for large inputs.</p><div class="divider" data-v-73834811></div><p class="review-content" data-v-73834811><span class="icon" data-v-73834811>🔑:</span></p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-063e3695><span data-v-063e3695>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
