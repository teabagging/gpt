correction included. However, the rules of word correction are really strange.Victor thinks that if a word contains two consecutive vowels, then it&#39;s kinda weird and it needs to be replaced. So the word corrector works in such a way: as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it. If there are no two consecutive vowels in the word, it is considered to be correct.You are given a word *s*. Can you predict what will it become after correction?In this problem letters a, e, i, o, u and y are considered to be vowels.The first line contains one integer *n* (1&lt;=≤&lt;=*n*&lt;=≤&lt;=100) — the number of letters in word *s* before the correction.The second line contains a string *s* consisting of exactly *n* lowercase Latin letters — the word before the correction.Output the word *s* after the correction.Sample Input5weird4word5aaeaaSample Outputwerdworda</div><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>🧠:</span>Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to solve this problem where Victor&#39;s text editor corrects words by removing certain vowels. The rule is that as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, we delete the first vowel in such a pair. And we do this repeatedly until there are no two consecutive vowels left. Hmm.Wait, the problem says that whenever there are two consecutive vowels, we delete the first one in a word such that there&#39;s another vowel right before it. Wait, maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding. Let me read the problem statement again.Oh right: &quot;delete the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it.&quot; Wait, no. The corrector works by deleting the first vowel in the word that has a vowel immediately before it. So for example, if there&#39;s a pair of consecutive vowels, the first such occurrence where a vowel is preceded by another vowel, we delete the first one. And this process repeats until there are no such pairs.Wait, maybe the process is: scan the word from left to right. Whenever two consecutive vowels are found, delete the first one. Then, restart the scan from the beginning again, because deleting a character might create a new consecutive pair. Because after deletion, the characters after the deletion point shift left, so previous characters could form new pairs.But how exactly to model this? Let&#39;s take the sample inputs.First sample input: &#39;weird&#39;. The vowels are &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, and maybe &#39;e&#39; and &#39;i&#39; are consecutive. Let&#39;s see: the original word is &#39;w&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;d&#39;. The &#39;e&#39; and &#39;i&#39; are consecutive vowels. So according to the rule, we need to delete the first one in such a pair. So delete &#39;e&#39;, resulting in &#39;w i r d&#39; → &#39;wird&#39;? But the sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. Wait, the sample input 5 is &#39;weird&#39; and the output is &#39;werd&#39;. Wait, the sample input is &#39;weird&#39;, which is &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. The consecutive vowels are &#39;e&#39; followed by &#39;i&#39;. So according to the rule, we delete the first one in this pair. So &#39;e&#39; is deleted. So the word becomes &#39;wird&#39;. But the sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. Wait, that&#39;s conflicting. So maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem.Wait wait, the sample input 5&#39;s output is &#39;werd&#39;. Let me check again. Wait, the input is &#39;weird&#39;, which is &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. The consecutive vowels are &#39;e&#39; and &#39;i&#39;. So deleting the first vowel in this pair (the &#39;e&#39;) would leave &#39;w&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, which is &#39;wird&#39;. But the sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. Hmm, that&#39;s a problem. So perhaps my understanding of the process is wrong.Wait, perhaps the rule is that whenever there are two consecutive vowels, the first occurrence of such a pair in the word (leftmost) is found, and the first vowel in that pair is deleted. Then, the process repeats on the modified string. So let&#39;s take the first sample:Original word: &#39;weird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;First check for consecutive vowels. The first pair is &#39;e&#39; followed by &#39;i&#39;. So delete &#39;e&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39; → &#39;wird&#39;. Now, check again. The &#39;i&#39; is next to &#39;r&#39; (non-vowel), so no consecutive vowels. So the corrected word is &#39;wird&#39;. But the sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. So this is conflicting. Therefore, my reasoning must be wrong.Wait, perhaps I&#39;m misunderstanding the rule. Let me re-read the problem statement.The problem says: &quot;as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, it deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it.&quot; Oh! Wait, maybe the first vowel that has a vowel immediately before it. So for example, in the word, find the first position where a vowel is preceded by another vowel, and delete the first of those two.Wait, perhaps the process is:Loop:- Iterate through the string from left to right.- For each character (starting from index 1), check if the current character and the previous character are both vowels.- If such a pair is found, delete the previous character (the first one in the pair), then restart the process from the beginning.Repeat until no such pairs exist.Ah, that makes sense. So in the first sample, &#39;weird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;.Looking for pairs:At index 1 (e) and 0 (w) → not vowels.Then index 2 (i) and 1 (e). Both vowels. So we delete the previous character (e at index 1). The string becomes &#39;wird&#39;. Then, check again from the start.In &#39;wird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. Now, check for consecutive vowels. The i is next to w (non-vowel). Then r and d. So no consecutive vowels. So the corrected word is &#39;wird&#39;? But sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. So this is conflicting.Wait, but the sample output for the first case is &#39;werd&#39;. So there&#39;s a problem here. How does the input &#39;weird&#39; become &#39;werd&#39;?Wait, maybe I&#39;m missing something. Let me re-examine the sample input and output.Sample Input 1:5weird → output is &#39;werd&#39;Original word is &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;.So after correction, it becomes &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39; → &#39;werd&#39;.Wait, but according to the previous logic, the first pair is &#39;e&#39; and &#39;i&#39; (both vowels). So deleting &#39;e&#39; (the first in the pair) gives &#39;wird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. Then, in &#39;wird&#39; there&#39;s no consecutive vowels. So how does the sample output get &#39;werd&#39;? So my approach must be wrong.Alternatively, perhaps the rule is different. Let&#39;s re-express the problem statement.The corrector works as follows: as long as there are two consecutive vowels in the word, delete the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it. So the first vowel (in the entire word) that has a vowel before it. So the first occurrence where a vowel is preceded by a vowel.Wait, maybe the process is to find the first occurrence of two consecutive vowels (i.e., two vowels in a row) in the word, then delete the first vowel in that pair. Then repeat the process on the modified word until there are no more consecutive vowels.Wait, let&#39;s take the first sample:Original word: &#39;weird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;The first pair of consecutive vowels is &#39;e&#39; and &#39;i&#39;. So delete the first one (e). The string becomes &#39;wird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. Now, check again. Are there any consecutive vowels? The &#39;i&#39; is a vowel, but next to &#39;r&#39; (non-vowel). So no. So output is &#39;wird&#39; which does not match the sample output. So this can&#39;t be right.But the sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. So perhaps the correct process is different. Let&#39;s see what the sample output implies. The original &#39;weird&#39; becomes &#39;werd&#39;. So the &#39;i&#39; is deleted instead of &#39;e&#39;? That can&#39;t be. Wait, in &#39;weird&#39;, the vowels are &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;. So consecutive. But the corrected word is &#39;werd&#39; which is &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. So the &#39;i&#39; is removed. So perhaps the rule is to delete the second vowel in the pair.But the problem statement says: delete the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it. Wait, that&#39;s confusing. The wording is a bit ambiguous.Wait, the problem statement says: &quot;delete the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it.&quot; So perhaps the first vowel (in the entire word) that is preceded by another vowel, and delete that. So for example, in the word &#39;aaeaa&#39;, perhaps the process is:Original string: a a e a a.First, find the first vowel that has a vowel before it. Let&#39;s see:- The first character is &#39;a&#39; (no previous character).- Second character is &#39;a&#39; (preceded by &#39;a&#39; → vowel). So this is the first such occurrence. So delete the first vowel (the first &#39;a&#39;) in the pair. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says: delete the first vowel in the word such that there&#39;s another vowel before it. So the first vowel that is immediately after another vowel. So the second character in the pair. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.Wait, the problem says: delete the first vowel in the word that has a vowel before it. So for example, in &#39;aa&#39;, the first vowel that has a vowel before it is the second &#39;a&#39;. Because the first &#39;a&#39; has nothing before it. So the second &#39;a&#39; is preceded by a vowel. So the first occurrence where a vowel is preceded by a vowel is the second &#39;a&#39; in the pair. Then, delete the first vowel in such a pair. Wait, the wording is confusing.Wait, the problem statement says: &quot;deletes the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it.&quot;Wait, the first vowel in the word (the earliest one) that has a vowel immediately before it. So the first occurrence where a vowel is preceded by another vowel. So in &#39;aa&#39;, the first vowel that has a vowel before it is the second &#39;a&#39;. Because the first &#39;a&#39; has no previous character. So the &#39;a&#39; at position 1 (0-based index 1) is preceded by a vowel (position 0). So the first such vowel is the one at index 1. Then, delete the first vowel in the word that satisfies this condition. Wait, but the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse the sentence again.The corrector deletes the first vowel in the word such that there is another vowel right before it. So in the word, find the first vowel (leftmost) that is immediately preceded by a vowel. Then delete that vowel. Wait, no. Because if you have vowels in positions i-1 and i, then the first such occurrence is at position i. So the first vowel that is preceded by a vowel would be at position i. Then, delete that vowel (position i). Or is it the first vowel in a pair (position i-1) that has another vowel after it? Hmm. This is ambiguous.Alternatively, perhaps the process is to find the first pair of consecutive vowels (two vowels in a row), and delete the first vowel in that pair. Then, restart processing from the beginning of the string. Let&#39;s see how that works with the sample input.Sample input 1: &#39;weird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;The first pair of consecutive vowels is &#39;e&#39; followed by &#39;i&#39;. So the first vowel in this pair is &#39;e&#39;. So delete &#39;e&#39;. The string becomes &#39;wird&#39; → &#39;w&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;. Now, check again. Are there any consecutive vowels? &#39;i&#39; is followed by &#39;r&#39; → no. So the output is &#39;wird&#39;. But the sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. So this approach is incorrect.But the sample output is &#39;werd&#39;. So in that case, the &#39;i&#39; is deleted instead of &#39;e&#39;. How?Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to delete the second vowel in the pair. Let&#39;s try that. So in the first sample, &#39;e&#39; and &#39;i&#39; are consecutive. Delete &#39;i&#39; → &#39;w&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;d&#39; → &#39;werd&#39;. Which matches the sample output. So this would be the correct approach. But according to the problem statement, which says to delete the first vowel in the pair, this doesn&#39;t align. So perhaps the problem statement&#39;s wording is ambiguous or perhaps I&#39;m misunderstanding.Wait the problem statement says: &quot;delete the first vowel in a word such that there is another vowel right before it.&quot;So the first vowel (in the word) where there is a vowel immediately before it. So the first occurrence of a vowel that is preceded by another vowel. So that would be the second vowel in a pair.For example, in the pair &#39;ea&#39;, the first vowel in the entire word that has a vowel before it is the &#39;a&#39; (since &#39;e&#39; has no vowel before). So delete the &#39;a&#39;? Or perhaps the &#39;e&#39; is not considered because there&#39;s no vowel before it. So the first vowel that is preceded by a vowel is the &#39;a&#39;, so delete that &#39;a&#39;.Wait, but the &#39;a&#39; is the second vowel in the pair. So deleting the first vowel that has a vowel before it (the &#39;a&#39;) would remove it, leaving &#39;e&#39;. Then, check again. So in the sample input &#39;weird&#39;, the consecutive vowels are &#39;e&#39; and &#39;i&#39;. The first vowel in the word that has a vowel before it is &#39;i&#39;, since the &#39;e&#39; is preceded by &#39;w&#39;, which is not a vowel. So the &#39;i&#39; is preceded by &#39;e&#39;, which is a vowel. So the first such vowel is &#39;i&#39; (position 2). So delete that &#39;i&#39;. So the string becomes &#39;werd&#39;, which matches the sample output. So this makes sense.So the correct approach is: in the word, find the first occurrence of a vowel that is immediately preceded by a vowel. Then, delete that vowel (the second in the pair). Then, repeat the process until no such pairs exist.So the process is:Loop:1. Iterate through the string from left to right.2. For each position i from 1 to length-1:   a. Check if s[i] is a vowel and s[i-1] is a vowel.   b. If found, delete the character at position i (the second vowel in the pair).   c. Then, restart the loop from the beginning of the modified string.3. If no such pairs are found, break the loop.Wait, but in the sample input 1, &#39;weird&#39; → the first occurrence is at i=1 (s[1] is &#39;e&#39;) and i=2 is &#39;i&#39;? No, wait in &#39;weird&#39; the indexes are 0-based:0: w (consonant)1: e (vowel)2: i (vowel)3: r (consonant)4: d (consonant)So the first pair is i=1 (e) and i=2 (i). So s[i-1] is vowel (e) and s[i] is vowel (i). So according to the rule, we need to delete the first vowel in the word that has a vowel before it. Wait, according to the problem statement&#39;s phrasing: the first vowel in the word such that there is another vowel right before it. So which vowel is that?The problem says &quot;the first vowel in the word&quot; (so the earliest occurrence in the entire word) that has a vowel before it. So the first such vowel would be the one at position 1 (e) only if the previous character (position 0) is a vowel. But in &#39;weird&#39;, position 0 is &#39;w&#39;, which is not a vowel. So position 1 is &#39;e&#39;, which is a vowel but preceded by a consonant. So no. Then position 2 is &#39;i&#39;, preceded by &#39;e&#39; (vowel). So this is the first vowel in the word that has a vowel before it. So delete this vowel (i at position 2). The string becomes &#39;werd&#39;, which is the sample output. Then, check again. The resulting string is &#39;w&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;d&#39;. Now, check for consecutive vowels. &#39;e&#39; is followed by &#39;r&#39; → no. So done.So the process is: find the first vowel that is preceded by a vowel. Then delete that vowel (the second in the pair). Then repeat.So the correct approach is to process the string by checking each vowel (starting from the first possible) and find the first vowel that is preceded by a vowel. Once found, delete it. Then, restart the process from the beginning of the modified string.So the algorithm is:While there exists consecutive vowels:   Find the first occurrence of a vowel that is immediately preceded by a vowel.   Delete that vowel (the second in the pair).Repeat until no such vowels exist.So for example, in the sample input &#39;aaeaa&#39; (third sample), the process is:Original string: a a e a a.First, find the first vowel that has a vowel before it. The first such occurrence is the second &#39;a&#39; (index 1, since it&#39;s preceded by &#39;a&#39; at index 0). So delete that &#39;a&#39; → the string becomes a e a a. Now, check again.The new string is a e a a. Check for consecutive vowels. The first pair is &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39; (indexes 0 and 1). &#39;e&#39; is a vowel, but &#39;a&#39; is vowel. So &#39;e&#39; is preceded by &#39;a&#39;. So delete &#39;e&#39; (the second vowel in the pair). The string becomes a a a. Then, check again.In a a a, the first occurrence is the second &#39;a&#39; (index 1, preceded by &#39;a&#39;). Delete index 1 → string becomes a a. Then, check again: consecutive vowels. The second &#39;a&#39; (index 1) is preceded by &#39;a&#39;, so delete index 1 → string becomes &#39;a&#39;. So the output is &#39;a&#39;, which matches the third sample.So the algorithm is to process the string, each time finding the first vowel that is preceded by a vowel (i.e., the second vowel in a consecutive pair), delete it, and repeat until no such pairs.So the steps are:1. Iterate through the string, checking for vowels.2. For each position i starting from 0, check if s[i] is a vowel and s[i-1] (if exists) is a vowel.3. Find the first such i where s[i] is a vowel and s[i-1] is a vowel. Then delete s[i].4. Repeat this process until no more such positions are found.But wait, in the first sample, the first occurrence is at i=2 (s[2] is &#39;i&#39; and s[1] is &#39;e&#39;). So delete s[2], resulting in &#39;werd&#39;.So the approach is to scan the string from left to right, and for each i, check if current and previous are vowels. When the first such pair is found, delete the current character (i), then restart the scan.So the way to implement this is:Loop:   Iterate through the string, for each i in 0 to len(s)-1:      if i &gt;=1 and s[i-1] is vowel and s[i] is vowel:          remove s[i], then break and restart the loop.   If no such pair is found during the iteration, break.So the code should repeatedly check the string for any consecutive vowel pairs, and each time the leftmost pair&#39;s second vowel is removed.Now, how to code this?First, we need a way to check if a character is a vowel. The vowels are a, e, i, o, u, y. So create a set containing these letters.Then, the process is to loop through the string, looking for consecutive vowels. Once found, delete the second one, and repeat.But since strings are immutable in Python, we can convert the string to a list for easier manipulation.Let me outline the steps:Read n and s.vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;y&#39;}loop:   modified = False   for i in range(1, len(s)):       if s[i-1] in vowels and s[i] in vowels:           # found the first occurrence. delete s[i]           s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]           modified = True           break  # exit the for loop to restart the process   if not modified:       breakreturn s.Wait, but in Python, strings are immutable, so each time we delete a character, we create a new string.So let&#39;s code this as:s = list(s)  # convert to list for easier manipulationthen loop:modified = Falsefor i in range(1, len(s)):    if s[i-1] in vowels and s[i] in vowels:        del s[i]        modified = True        breakif not modified:    breakrepeat until no more changes.Wait, but when you delete s[i], the list becomes shorter by one. So in the next iteration, the indices change.For example, if the list is [a, a, e, a, a], after deleting index 1, the list becomes [a, e, a, a]. Then, the next iteration starts from i=1 again.But in the code above, after deleting s[i], the loop breaks and restarts from the beginning. So each time a deletion is made, the loop starts over. So that&#39;s correct.So the code would look like:vowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;y&#39;}s = list(input().strip())while True:    modified = False    for i in range(1, len(s)):        if s[i-1] in vowels and s[i] in vowels:            del s[i]            modified = True            break  # exit the loop to restart from the beginning    if not modified:        breakprint(&#39;&#39;.join(s))Testing this code with the sample inputs:Sample 1: &#39;weird&#39; → list is [&#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;]First iteration:i runs from 1 to 4:i=1: s[0] is &#39;w&#39; (not vowel), so no.i=2: s[1] is &#39;e&#39; (vowel), s[2] is &#39;i&#39; (vowel). So delete s[2], which is &#39;i&#39;. Now the list is [&#39;w&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;].modified is True, so break and restart.Second iteration:Check len(s) is 4.i runs from 1 to 3:i=1: s[0] is &#39;w&#39;, no.i=2: s[1] is &#39;e&#39; (vowel), s[2] is &#39;r&#39; → no.i=3: s[2] is &#39;r&#39;, no.No modification. So exit loop. Output &#39;werd&#39;, which matches the sample.Third sample input: &#39;aaeaa&#39; → [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;]First iteration:i runs from 1 to 4.i=1: s[0] is &#39;a&#39;, s[1] is &#39;a&#39; → both vowels. Delete s[1]. Now list is [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;] → modified, break.Next iteration:i runs from 1 to 3.s[0] is &#39;a&#39;, s[1] is &#39;e&#39; → both vowels? &#39;a&#39; is vowel, &#39;e&#39; is vowel. So yes. i=1, delete s[1] → list becomes [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;].Next iteration:i runs from 1 to 2.i=1: s[0] is &#39;a&#39;, s[1] is &#39;a&#39; → delete s[1], list becomes [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;].Next iteration:i=1: s[0] and s[1] are vowels. delete s[1], list becomes [&#39;a&#39;].No more iterations. Output &#39;a&#39; which matches the sample.Second sample input: &#39;word&#39; → [&#39;w&#39;,&#39;o&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;d&#39;]Check for consecutive vowels:i=1: s[0] is &#39;w&#39; (no), i=1: s[1] is &#39;o&#39; (vowel). s[0] is not vowel. So no. i=2: s[1] is &#39;o&#39;, s[2] is &#39;r&#39; → no. i=3: s[2] is &#39;r&#39;, no. So no modifications. Output &#39;word&#39;.So this code seems to handle all the sample cases correctly.Therefore, the correct code is as above.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to correct a word by removing consecutive vowels according to specific rules. The goal is to repeatedly remove the second vowel in the first occurrence of consecutive vowels until no such pairs remain. Approach1. Identify Consecutive Vowels: Check the word from left to right to find the first occurrence of two consecutive vowels.2. Remove the Second Vowel: When consecutive vowels are found, remove the second vowel in the pair.3. Repeat Process: Continue the process until no more consecutive vowels are found. Solution Code```pythonvowels = {&#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;y&#39;}n = int(input())s = list(input().strip())modified = Truewhile modified:    modified = False    for i in range(1, len(s)):        if s[i-1] in vowels and s[i] in vowels:            del s[i]            modified = True            break  # Restart the process after modificationprint(&#39;&#39;.join(s))``` Explanation1. Reading Input: The input consists of an integer `n` (length of the word) and the word `s` itself.2. Convert to List: Convert the string `s` into a list for easier manipulation since strings are immutable in Python.3. Loop Until No Modifications: Use a loop that continues until no more consecutive vowels are found.4. Check for Consecutive Vowels: Iterate through the list, checking each pair of consecutive characters. If both are vowels, remove the second one.5. Break and Restart: After each modification, break out of the loop and restart the check from the beginning to handle any new consecutive vowels formed by deletions.This approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly modify the word according to the given rules, resulting in the desired output.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c068b9fe data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review" data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review-title" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>❓:</span>Karafs is some kind of vegetable in shape of an 1&lt;=×&lt;=*h* rectangle.

Let&#39;s read the problem statement carefully.So, the problem is about Karafses arranged in a sequence. Each Karafs has a height defined by s_i = A + (i-1)*B. So it&#39;s an arithmetic sequence starting at A with difference B. For each query, we get l, t, m and need to find the largest r ≥ l such that the subarray from l to r can be eaten using at most t operations of m-bite. If no such r exists, output -1.An m-bite operation allows us to decrease at most m distinct Karafses by 1 each. The goal is to eat all in the subarray, which means their heights become zero. Each operation can choose up to m distinct ones (but you can choose fewer, like if there&#39;s only one left). The key is to find the minimal number of operations required for a given l to r, then check if it&#39;s ≤ t.Hmm. So how do we model the number of operations needed for a particular range l to r?Let&#39;s think. Each Karafs in the range has a certain height. To eat them, each must be reduced to zero. The process can be optimized by doing as much as possible in each operation. Since each operation can decrease up to m different Karafses by 1, the minimal number of operations required is the maximum between:1. The total sum of heights divided by m (since each operation can contribute at most m to the sum). But wait, since each operation reduces exactly m (if possible) elements by 1. So the sum of all heights must be &lt;= t * m. Also, the maximum individual height in the range can&#39;t exceed t. Because even if you have a sum that&#39;s small enough, if one Karafs has height greater than t, you can&#39;t eat it because each operation can only decrease it once per step.So for a given range l to r, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:sum(s_l, s_{l+1}, ..., s_r) &lt;= t * mANDmax(s_l, ..., s_r) &lt;= tIf both conditions are met, then it&#39;s possible. The minimal number of operations is the maximum of (sum / m (rounded up?), max_height). Wait, no. Because the sum divided by m (ceiling) is the minimal number of operations needed if you can fully utilize each operation. But also, you can&#39;t have any individual element requiring more than t operations, since each operation can decrease it once. So the total operations needed is the maximum between the maximum height and the ceiling of sum / m. But wait, that&#39;s not exactly right. Let&#39;s think again.Suppose sum of the heights is S. Each operation can contribute up to m to S. So the minimal number of operations is ceil(S / m). But also, each Karafs must be decreased exactly s_i times. The maximum s_i is H. So the minimal number of operations is the maximum between H and ceil(S / m). Because:- The sum S must be covered, which requires at least S/m operations (if each contributes m).- Each Karafs must be decreased H times, which requires at least H operations.So the minimal number of operations is the maximum of these two. Therefore, for a range l to r, the conditions are:max(s_l, ..., s_r) &lt;= t AND sum(s_l, ..., s_r) &lt;= t * m If both are true, then the required operations is max(H, S/m), which must be &lt;= t. But since H &lt;= t and S &lt;= t*m, then S/m &lt;= t. So the maximum would be H (if H &gt;= S/m) or S/m (if H &lt; S/m). Wait, but S/m could be up to t, since S &lt;= t*m. So if both conditions are met, then the required operations is the maximum of these two values, which is &lt;= t. Therefore, the two conditions are sufficient.So for each query, we need to find the largest r &gt;= l such that:1. s_r &lt;= t (since s is increasing, the maximum in l..r is s_r)2. sum of s_l to s_r &lt;= t * mBecause the sequence s_i is strictly increasing (since B is positive). So the maximum in the range l..r is s_r. So condition 1 is s_r &lt;= t.So first, we can check for each query l, whether s_l &gt; t. If yes, then even the first element (r=l) would have s_r &gt;t, so answer is -1.Else, the maximum possible r is the largest index where s_r &lt;= t and sum from l to r &lt;= t*m.But how to compute this efficiently?The steps for each query:1. Check if s_l &gt; t. If yes, output -1.Else:We need to find the largest r &gt;= l where s_r &lt;= t, and sum(l..r) &lt;= t*m.So first, find the maximum r where s_r &lt;= t. Let&#39;s call this r_max. Then, within this r_max, find the maximum r such that sum(l..r) &lt;= t*m. The answer is the minimum between r_max and the r where sum is &lt;= t*m.Wait, but how?Alternatively, the answer is the minimum between r_max (due to s_r &lt;=t) and the r_max_sum (the maximum r where sum(l..r) &lt;= t*m). Because even if the sum allows a larger r, but the individual s_r may exceed t. So the answer is the minimum between the maximum r allowed by s_r &lt;= t and the maximum r allowed by sum &lt;= t*m.But wait, no. Because for a range l to r, even if sum is &lt;= t*m, but some s_i (i &lt;= r) might be greater than t. But since the sequence is strictly increasing, the maximum s_i in l..r is s_r. So once r is &lt;= r_max (s_r &lt;= t), then all elements in l..r are &lt;= t. So for the sum to be allowed, we need to find the maximum r such that r &lt;= r_max and sum(l..r) &lt;= t*m.So the steps are:For a query l, t, m:If s_l &gt; t: answer is -1.Else:Find r_max as the maximum r where s_r &lt;= t. Since s_i = A + (i-1)*B, which is an arithmetic sequence. So s_r = A + (r-1)*B &lt;= t → r &lt;= (t - A)/B + 1. But since r must be &gt;= l. So the maximum possible r_max is floor( (t - A) / B ) + 1. But wait, when s_i is A + (i-1)*B. So solving for i:A + (i-1)*B &lt;= t → i-1 &lt;= (t - A)/B → i &lt;= (t - A)/B + 1. Since i must be an integer, r_max is the maximum i where this holds. But if (t - A) is negative, then there are no such i &gt;= l. So in that case, even the first element is larger than t. But in that case, s_l would be A + (l-1)*B. So if that&#39;s &gt;t, then output is -1.So once we compute r_max, which is the maximum possible r where s_r &lt;= t, then within l &lt;= r &lt;= r_max, we need to find the maximum r such that sum(l..r) &lt;= t*m.So the answer is the minimum between r_max and the maximum r where sum(l..r) &lt;= t*m. Because if the sum allows a larger r than r_max, then r_max is the limiting factor. Otherwise, the sum is the limiting factor.But how to compute sum(l..r) efficiently.Sum of the arithmetic sequence from l to r: s_l + s_{l+1} + ... + s_r.s_i is A + (i-1)*B. So sum from l to r is sum_{i=l to r} (A + (i-1)*B) = (r - l +1)*A + B * sum_{i=l to r} (i-1).sum_{i=l to r} (i-1) = sum_{k=l-1 to r-1} k = sum_{k=0 to r-1} k - sum_{k=0 to l-2} k.Which is (r-1)*r/2 - (l-2)(l-1)/2.So sum = (r - l + 1)*A + B*( (r-1)*r//2 - (l-2)*(l-1)//2 )Let me compute that as a formula.So sum(l, r) = (r - l +1) * A + B * ( (r(r-1) - (l-1)(l-2)) ) / 2 )Yes.So for a given l, and r_max (max r where s_r &lt;= t), we need to find the largest r &lt;= r_max such that sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m.So the problem reduces to, for each query, after checking s_l &lt;= t, compute r_max, then find the maximum r in [l, r_max] where sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m. The answer is the maximum of such r.If there&#39;s no such r (i.e., even the sum from l to l is larger than t*m), then answer is -1. Wait, but sum(l to l) is s_l, which is &lt;= t (since r_max &gt;= l, which is possible only if s_l &lt;= t). But s_l &lt;= t, but m could be such that t*m &lt; s_l. Then sum would be s_l &gt; t*m. So in that case, even for r=l, the sum is s_l &gt; t*m. So the answer is -1.Wait, but in that case, sum(l..l) = s_l &lt;= t (since r_max &gt;= l), but t*m could be less than s_l. So sum &gt; t*m. So even if the max height is &lt;= t, the sum is too big. So for the query, even the first element can&#39;t be processed. So the answer is -1.So steps for each query:1. Check if s_l &gt; t → answer is -1.Else:2. Compute r_max: maximum r where s_r &lt;= t. If there&#39;s no such r (but s_l &lt;=t, which would only happen if B=0? But B is given as positive. So no, since B is positive. So s_r is increasing. So once s_l &lt;=t, there exists some r_max &gt;= l.Wait, since B is positive, the sequence is strictly increasing. So if s_l &lt;= t, then the maximum r where s_r &lt;= t is floor( (t - A)/B ) + 1. Let&#39;s compute this.Wait, s_i = A + (i-1)*B. So solving for i: A + (i-1)*B &lt;= t → i-1 &lt;= (t - A)/B → i &lt;= (t - A)/B +1. So the maximum i is floor( (t - A)/B ) + 1. But since (t - A) could be negative, but in that case, s_l (l &gt;=1) may still be &lt;=t. Wait, no. Because if s_l = A + (l-1)*B &gt; t, then even if (t -A) is negative, but l could be such that (l-1)*B is large enough. So how do we compute r_max correctly?Wait, let&#39;s find r_max as the maximum r such that s_r &lt;= t.s_r &lt;= t → A + (r-1)*B &lt;= t → r-1 &lt;= (t - A)/B → r &lt;= (t - A + B) / B.Wait, perhaps better to compute:r_max = (t - A) // B + 1.But if (t - A) is negative, then (t -A) // B is negative. For example, if t = 3, A=5, B=2. Then (3-5)/2 = -1, so r_max is -1 +1 =0. But s_0 is not part of the sequence. So in this case, there&#39;s no r where s_r &lt;=t.But how do we handle that?So the correct way to compute r_max is:r_max = floor( (t - A)/B ) + 1.But since s_i is 1-based, the maximum possible r is such that s_r &lt;=t. So if (t -A) is negative, then r_max can be 0, which is invalid. So in that case, if even s_1 (r=1) is A +0*B =A. If A &gt;t, then there is no r where s_r &lt;=t. So in this case, if s_l (the query&#39;s l) is &lt;=t, but (t -A) &lt;0 → A &gt;t → then s_l =A + (l-1)*B &gt;=A &gt;t. So the initial check would have output -1.So the steps:For a query with l, t, m:Check if s_l &gt;t → output -1.Else:Compute r_max as floor( (t -A) / B ) + 1. Because s_r_max = A + (r_max-1)*B &lt;=t.But r_max must be &gt;= l. So the actual r_max is the minimum between floor(...) +1 and the maximum possible r (which could be very large, but the sequence is infinite). Wait, no. The r_max is the maximum possible r such that s_r &lt;=t. So even if the computed r_max is larger than l, we can take it, but in the sum, we can only take up to that r_max.But how to compute r_max correctly?Wait, let&#39;s compute:We have s_r = A + (r-1)*B &lt;= t → r &lt;= (t -A)/B +1.But since r must be an integer, the maximum possible r is floor( (t -A)/B ) +1.But (t -A) could be negative. So let&#39;s see:If (t -A) &lt;0 → then (t -A)/B is negative (since B is positive). So floor( (t -A)/B ) is &lt;=-1. Then r_max is &lt;=0. So in this case, there&#39;s no r &gt;=1 where s_r &lt;=t. But since s_l is &lt;=t (we passed the initial check), but l must be &gt;=1. So this is impossible. So how could s_l &lt;=t when (t -A) is negative?Wait, because s_l is A + (l-1)*B. If (t -A) &lt;0 → t &lt;A. Then s_1 =A &gt;t. So if l=1, then s_l is &gt;t, which would have been caught by the initial check. So in this case, the initial check would output -1.So in the code, after checking s_l &lt;=t, we can compute r_max as floor( (t -A)/B ) +1. But since in that case, (t -A) must be &gt;= (s_l -A) - (since s_l &lt;=t). Because s_l is A + (l-1)*B &lt;=t → (l-1)*B &lt;= t -A → (t -A) &gt;= (l-1)*B → (t -A) &gt;= B*(l-1) ≥0 (since B and l-1 are non-negative, because l ≥1). So (t -A) is non-negative here. So when we proceed to compute r_max, (t -A)/B is non-negative. So floor((t -A)/B) is integer &gt;=0, and r_max is that plus 1.So r_max = (t -A) // B +1.But wait, for example, if t =A, then (t -A)/B =0 → r_max =1. So s_1 =A =t → valid.Another example: A=2, B=1. For t=5: (5-2)/1 =3 → r_max=4. s_4=2+3*1=5&lt;=5. s_5=6&gt;5.So this is correct.So once we have r_max, but the problem is that r_max could be very large (like up to 1e18). But since the sum from l to r must be &lt;= t*m, we need to find the maximum r &lt;= r_max such that sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m.But how to compute this maximum r efficiently.The sum is a quadratic function of r. Let&#39;s model sum(l, r) as a function and find the maximum r where sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m and r &lt;= r_max.Sum(l, r) can be written as:sum = (r - l + 1)*A + B * [ (r*(r-1) - (l-1)*(l-2)) ) / 2 ]Let&#39;s simplify this:sum = A*(r - l +1) + (B/2)*(r(r-1) - (l-1)(l-2)) )We can expand the terms:r(r-1) = r² - r(l-1)(l-2) = l² -3l +2So sum = A*(r - l +1) + (B/2)(r² - r - l² +3l -2 )But maybe it&#39;s better to keep it as is. Let&#39;s think of the sum as a function of r.The sum increases as r increases (since each term s_i is positive). So for a fixed l, sum(l, r) is a monotonically increasing function of r. So we can perform binary search on r in the range [l, r_max] to find the largest r where sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m.Yes. So for each query, after computing r_max (which is the maximum r where s_r &lt;=t), we can binary search between l and r_max to find the maximum r where the sum is &lt;= t*m.But since r_max can be up to (1e12) if B is 1 and t is 1e6 (since (t -A)/B can be up to 1e6, so r_max up to 1e6+1). But n is up to 1e5 queries, and binary search per query would be O(log (1e6)) per query, which is acceptable.So the steps for each query:1. Compute s_l = A + (l-1)*B. If s_l &gt;t → output -1.2. Else compute r_max = (t - A) // B +1. If r_max &lt; l → output -1 (since even the first r is larger than r_max, but sum would require r &gt;= l). Wait, but r_max is computed as the maximum r where s_r &lt;=t. So if r_max &lt;l, then s_l (which is l&#39;s value) would be &gt;t. But we already checked s_l &lt;=t. So this can&#39;t happen. So step 2 is redundant. So we can proceed.3. Now, the maximum possible r is r_max. But we need to find the maximum r between l and r_max such that sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m.4. So perform binary search in the range [l, r_max] to find the maximum r where sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m.If even sum(l, l) &gt; t*m → output -1.Else find the maximum r.But how to compute sum(l, r) efficiently?Yes. Because for each binary search step, we can compute the sum in O(1) time.So for each query:- Check s_l &lt;=t. If not, output -1.Else:Compute r_max = (t -A) // B +1.Compute the sum from l to r_max. If sum &lt;= t*m → answer is r_max.Else, binary search between l and r_max to find the maximum r where sum &lt;= t*m.But even the sum from l to r_max can be larger than t*m, so binary search is needed.So the binary search approach is as follows:Initialize low = l, high = r_max.Initialize answer = -1.While low &lt;= high:   mid = (low + high) // 2   compute sum(l, mid)   if sum &lt;= t*m:      answer = mid      low = mid +1   else:      high = mid -1At the end, if answer is &gt;=l, then answer is the maximum r. Else, if sum(l, l) &gt;t*m → answer is -1.But wait, since s_l &lt;=t and m &gt;=1, t*m &gt;= t*1 &gt;= s_l (since s_l &lt;=t). Wait, no. Because m can be 1, t can be such that t*m = t. So s_l &lt;=t, but sum(l, l) =s_l. So if s_l &lt;=t and t*m &gt;=s_l → sum is allowed. So the sum for r=l is s_l, which must be &lt;=t*m.Wait, but m is given per query, so it&#39;s possible that t*m &lt; s_l. For example, s_l=5, t=5, m=0.5 (but m is integer ≥1). Wait, m is given as an integer up to 1e6. So m is ≥1. So t*m &gt;= t. Since s_l &lt;=t, then sum(l, l) =s_l &lt;=t &lt;=t*m. So sum is always &lt;=t*m for r=l.Wait, no. Because s_l can be 5, t=5, m=1 → t*m=5. sum(l, l) is 5 → 5 &lt;=5 → allowed.But what if s_l=5, t=5, m=0 (but m is ≥1 per input constraints). So no, m is ≥1.In the problem statement, the input constraints say 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e6. So m is at least 1. So t*m &gt;=t. So sum(l, l) =s_l &lt;=t &lt;= t*m → sum is &lt;= t*m. So for the binary search, if r_max &gt;=l, then sum(l, l) is &lt;= t*m. So there exists at least one r (r=l) that satisfies the sum condition. So the binary search will find the maximum r in [l, r_max] where sum is &lt;= t*m.So the answer for the query is the minimum between r_max (due to max height) and the r found via binary search (due to sum). Wait, no. Because r_max is the maximum possible r allowed by the max height condition, and the sum&#39;s binary search is within r_max. So the answer is the r found by binary search.Wait, no. Because the binary search is performed in [l, r_max], so the r found is the maximum possible r in that interval where sum is allowed. So the answer is that r.But wait, what if r_max is larger than some r where sum is allowed. For example, r_max is 100, but the sum allowed r up to 50. So the binary search will find 50. But the answer is 50.So the answer is the result of the binary search.So in code:Once the binary search is done, the answer is the found r. If the binary search finds no r (but sum(l, l) is s_l &lt;=t*m → which is always true as explained), then this can&#39;t happen. So the answer is the found r.So the code steps:For each query:l, t, m = ... s_l = A + (l-1)*Bif s_l &gt; t:   output -1else:   r_max = (t - A) // B +1   if r_max &lt; l:       output -1 (but this can&#39;t happen because s_l &lt;=t implies that r_max &gt;=l)   else:       low = l       high = r_max       ans = l       while low &lt;= high:           mid = (low + high) //2           sum = compute_sum(l, mid)           if sum &lt;= t*m:               ans = mid               low = mid +1           else:               high = mid -1       output ansBut need to compute compute_sum(l, r) efficiently.Implementing compute_sum:sum = (r - l +1)*A + B * ( (r*(r-1) - (l-1)*(l-2)) ) //2Wait, let&#39;s compute:sum_{i=l}^r (A + (i-1)*B )= A*(r-l+1) + B * sum_{i=l}^r (i-1)sum_{i=l}^r (i-1) = sum_{k=l-1}^{r-1} k = sum_{0 to r-1} k - sum_{0 to l-2} kWhich is ( (r-1)*r ) / 2 - ( (l-2)(l-1) ) / 2 )So:sum = A * (r - l +1) + B * [ ( (r-1)*r - (l-2)(l-1) ) // 2 ]Yes.So code for compute_sum(l, r):terms = r - l +1sum_a = terms * Asum_b_part = ( (r-1)*r - (l-2)*(l-1) ) // 2sum_b = B * sum_b_parttotal = sum_a + sum_bSo in Python, the code can be written as:def compute_sum(A, B, l, r):    terms = r - l + 1    sum_a = terms * A    sum_b_part = ( (r-1)*r - (l-2)*(l-1) ) // 2    sum_b = B * sum_b_part    return sum_a + sum_bBut wait, for l=1, (l-2) is -1, and (l-2)*(l-1) is (-1)*(0) =0. So for l=1, sum_b_part is (r-1)*r - 0 = r(r-1), which is correct.Yes.Now, considering possible integer overflows, but in Python, integers can be large.Now, let&#39;s test with the sample input.Sample Input:2 1 41 5 3 → query 1: l=1, t=5, m=3Sample Output: 4Let&#39;s compute for query 1.s_l = 2 + (1-1)*1 =2 &lt;=5.r_max = (5-2)//1 +1 =3 +1=4.sum(l,4) = compute_sum(2,1,1,4).terms=4.sum_a=4*2=8.sum_b_part = (3*4 - (0)*( -1 )) → 12 -0=12. sum_b=1*12=12. total=20.t*m=5*3=15. 20&gt;15. So need to binary search.Wait, but sum for r=4 is 20&gt;15. So need to find the maximum r in [1,4] where sum &lt;=15.So binary search:low=1, high=4.mid=2:sum(1,2) = 2+3=5. 5&lt;=15 → ans=2. low=3.mid=3 (3+4)//2=3.5 → 3.sum(1,3) =2+3+4=9 &lt;=15 → ans=3. low=4.mid=4 → sum=20&gt;15 → high=3. loop ends. So ans=3.But the sample output is 4. Wait, this contradicts. So something is wrong.Wait, the sample output for the first query is 4.Wait, perhaps my logic is wrong.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the problem.Sample Input:A=2, B=1.The first query is l=1, t=5, m=3.So:s_l=2 &lt;=5.r_max is (5-2)//1 +1=3+1=4.sum from 1 to 4 is 2+3+4+5=14. 14 &lt;=5*3=15. So sum is 14 &lt;=15. So why did the binary search give ans=3?Wait, compute_sum(1,4):terms=4, sum_a=4*2=8.sum_b_part = (4-1)*4 → 3*4=12? Or (r-1)*r is (4-1)*4=12. And (l-2)*(l-1) for l=1 is (1-2)*(1-1) = (-1)*0=0. So sum_b_part=12-0=12. sum_b=1*12=12. total 8+12=20. But 2+3+4+5=14. Wait, this is a discrepancy. So my formula is wrong.Wait, wait. The formula seems to compute sum as 20, but actual sum is 14. So there&#39;s a mistake.Ah! Oh no! Because the sum of (i-1) for i from 1 to4 is:i=1 → 0i=2 →1i=3 →2i=4 →3sum is 0+1+2+3=6. So B*sum_b_part should be 1*6=6. sum_a is 4*2=8. total 14.But according to the formula, sum_b_part is ( (4-1)*4 - (1-2)(1-1) ) /2 → (3*4 - (-1)*0 ) /2 → (12 -0)/2 →6. So sum_b_part is 6. So sum_b is 1*6=6. So sum is 8+6=14. Correct. Oh wait, but in the code above, the formula for sum_b_part is ( (r-1)*r - (l-2)(l-1) ) // 2. So for l=1, (l-2)(l-1) is (-1)*0=0. So sum_b_part = (3*4 -0)/2 →12/2=6. Correct.But in my previous calculation, I thought sum_b_part was 12. Why?Because I forgot to divide by 2. Oh right! The formula for sum_b_part is ( (r-1)*r - (l-2)(l-1) ) // 2. So (3*4 -0 ) is 12, divided by 2 is 6. So sum_b_part is 6, so sum_b is 1*6=6. sum_a is 8. Total sum 14.So why in the code example, when I computed sum(1,4) as 20, that was wrong. Because I forgot to divide by 2.Ah! So the code formula for sum_b_part should be ( ( (r-1)*r ) - ( (l-2)*(l-1) ) ) // 2.Yes. So the code for compute_sum is correct. So in the case of query 1, sum(l=1, r=4) is 14 &lt;=15. So why in the earlier binary search example, when I computed mid=4, sum was 14 &lt;=15, so ans=4.So the binary search would proceed as:low=1, high=4.mid = (1+4)//2=2.5 →2.sum(1,2) → 2+3=5 &lt;=15 → ans=2. low=3.mid=3 → sum(1,3)=2+3+4=9 &lt;=15 → ans=3. low=4.mid=4 → sum=14 &lt;=15 → ans=4. low=5. loop ends.So the answer is 4, which matches the sample output.So the code is correct. My earlier mistake was miscalculating sum_b_part.So for the first query, the answer is 4.So the code works for that case.Now, let&#39;s look at another sample case.Sample Input:Another query in sample input:7 10 2 → sample output is 8.Wait, let&#39;s see. Let me check the sample input.The sample input is:2 1 4 → A=2, B=1, 4 queries.Queries:1 5 3 → output 4.3 3 10 → output -1.7 10 2 → output 8.6 4 8 → output -1.Then another part of the sample input:But maybe the sample input is different.But in any case, let&#39;s see the code steps.Now, the code for each query is:Read A, B, n.Then for each query:l, t, m = map(int, input().split())compute s_l =A + (l-1)*B.if s_l &gt; t → output -1.else:r_max = (t -A) // B +1 → which is (t -A) // B +1.But since B is positive, and A + (r_max-1)*B &lt;=t.then compute binary search between l and r_max to find the maximum r where sum(l, r) &lt;= t*m.If during binary search, any sum(l, mid) &lt;=t*m → possible.So the code is correct.Now, what about when r_max is very large, like 1e12. Binary search in that case would take log2(1e12) ≈40 steps. For 1e5 queries, that&#39;s 4e6 steps, which is acceptable.Now, implement this in Python.But the problem states that the function should read from stdin, process, and print the output, and we have to call the function after definition.So the code structure is:Read A, B, n.Then read n queries.For each query, compute the answer as per the steps above.But for n up to 1e5, and each query processing O(40 steps), it&#39;s manageable.But in Python, for 1e5 queries with 40 steps each, that&#39;s 4e6 steps, which should be okay.Now, code.Implement:Read A, B, n.Then for each query:l, t, m = map(int, line.split())s_l = A + (l-1)*Bif s_l &gt; t:   print(-1)else:   r_max = (t - A) // B + 1   if r_max &lt; l:       print(-1)   else:       low = l       high = r_max       ans = l       while low &lt;= high:           mid = (low + high) // 2           # compute sum from l to mid           terms = mid - l + 1           sum_a = terms * A           sum_b_part = ( (mid -1)*mid - (l-2)*(l-1) ) // 2           sum_total = sum_a + B * sum_b_part           if sum_total &lt;= t * m:               ans = mid               low = mid +1           else:               high = mid -1       print(ans)Wait, but what if r_max is very large? For example, t is 1e6, A=1, B=1 → r_max = 1e6 //1 +1=1e6+1. But for each query, the binary search would take up to 20 steps. So it&#39;s manageable.But what about when r_max is smaller than l? For example, l=5, but r_max=3. But since s_l &lt;=t, then s_r_max &gt;=s_l. So s_l &lt;=t → but r_max is the largest r where s_r &lt;=t. But if l=5, then r_max must be &gt;=5. So this situation can&#39;t happen. Because s_r increases with r. So if s_l &lt;=t, then s_r for r=l is s_l &lt;=t. So r_max &gt;=l.So the check for r_max &lt;l is redundant. So we can skip that.So the code can omit that check.So in code:else:   r_max = (t - A) // B +1   # r_max is &gt;=l   low = l   high = r_max   ans = l   # binary search   ... So for example, if in the first sample query:A=2, B=1, query l=1, t=5, m=3.r_max = (5-2)//1 +1=3+1=4.binary search between 1 and 4.Now, sum(l, mid) is computed for mid=4:terms=4.sum_a=4*2=8.sum_b_part=(3*4 - (1-2)*(1-1))/2 → (12 -0)/2=6. sum_b=1*6=6. sum_total=14 &lt;=15 → ans=4.So code would return 4.Sample output is correct.Another sample case:Sample Input:3 3 10 → perhaps from the sample input&#39;s second query.Wait, the sample input&#39;s second line:The next lines are:1 5 3 → output 43 3 10 → output -17 10 2 → output 86 4 8 → output -1Then another line:1 5 2 → output 11 5 10 → output 22 7 4 → output -1.Sample output is:4-18-112So for the second query, 3 3 10.A=2, B=1.s_l = 3 → l=3.s_l = 2 + (3-1)*1=4. Which is 4&gt;3. So output is -1. Which matches the sample.So code works.Another sample case: query 3 in sample input:7 10 2 → l=7, t=10, m=2.A=2, B=1.s_l=2+6*1=8 &lt;=10.r_max = (10-2)/1 +1=8+1=9.sum from 7 to9: s_7=8, s_8=9, s_9=10.sum is 8+9+10=27. t*m=10*2=20. 27&gt;20. So binary search between 7 and9.Compute mid=8 → sum from7-8: 8+9=17 &lt;=20 → ans=8, low=9.mid=9: sum=27&gt;20 → high=8. loop ends. So ans=8. Which matches sample.So code works.Thus, the code should be correct.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest range of Karafses (a sequence of vegetables with heights in an arithmetic progression) that can be completely eaten using a given number of operations. Each operation can decrease the height of up to `m` distinct Karafses by 1. The solution involves efficiently checking constraints and using binary search to find the maximum valid range. Approach1. Problem Analysis:   - Each Karafs has a height defined by an arithmetic sequence.   - For each query, we need to determine the maximum range `[l, r]` such that all Karafses in this range can be eaten within `t` operations, each operation affecting at most `m` Karafses.2. Key Insights:   - The height of the `i`-th Karafs is `s_i = A + (i-1) * B`.   - To eat all Karafses in the range `[l, r]`, two conditions must be met:     1. The maximum height in the range must be ≤ `t`.     2. The total sum of heights in the range must be ≤ `t * m`.3. Algorithm:   - For each query, check if the height of the `l`-th Karafs exceeds `t`. If so, the answer is `-1`.   - Calculate the maximum possible `r` (`r_max`) such that the height of the `r`-th Karafs is ≤ `t`.   - Use binary search within the range `[l, r_max]` to find the largest `r` where the sum of heights from `l` to `r` is ≤ `t * m`.

Reading Input: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the large constraints.2. Initial Check: For each query, immediately check if the first element&#39;s height exceeds `t`, which would make the answer `-1`.3. Calculate `r_max`: Determine the maximum possible `r` where the height of the `r`-th Karafs is within `t`.4. Binary Search: Perform binary search within the valid range `[l, r_max]` to find the largest `r` where the sum of heights from `l` to `r` is within `t * m`.5. Output Results: Collect results for all queries and print them at once to minimize I/O operations.This approach ensures that each query is processed efficiently using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large input sizes.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c068b9fe data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review" data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review-title" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>❓:</span>Ivan has an array consisting of *n* different integers. He decided to reorder all elements in increasing order. Ivan loves merge sort so he decided to represent his array with one or several increasing sequences which he then plans to merge into one sorted array.Ivan represent his array with increasing sequences with help of the following algorithm.While there is at least one unused number in array Ivan repeats the following procedure: -  iterate through array from the left to the right; -  Ivan only looks at unused numbers on current iteration; -  if current number is the first unused number on this iteration or this number is greater than previous unused number on current iteration, then Ivan marks the number as used and writes it down. For example, if Ivan&#39;s array looks like [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] then he will perform two iterations. On first iteration Ivan will use and write numbers [1, 3, 5], and on second one — [2, 4].Write a program which helps Ivan and finds representation of the given array with one or several increasing sequences in accordance with algorithm described above.The first line contains a single integer *n* (1&lt;=≤&lt;=*n*&lt;=≤&lt;=2·105) — the number of elements in Ivan&#39;s array.The second line contains a sequence consisting of distinct integers *a*1,&lt;=*a*2,&lt;=...,&lt;=*an* (1&lt;=≤&lt;=*ai*&lt;=≤&lt;=109) — Ivan&#39;s array.Print representation of the given array in the form of one or more increasing sequences in accordance with the algorithm described above.

Let&#39;s read the problem statement carefully.So the algorithm is: while there are unused numbers, iterate left to right, and collect numbers that are either the first unused or greater than the previous collected in this iteration. Each such collected number forms part of a sequence, and each iteration creates one sequence.For example, the sample input [1,3,2,5,4] gives two sequences. First pass takes 1,3,5. Then the next pass takes 2 and 4.The task is to output all these sequences in the order they were generated.Hmm. How can I model this process efficiently?Let&#39;s think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to simulate each iteration. But for n up to 2e5, a naive approach might be too slow. So we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.Wait, each element is processed exactly once. So the total time is O(n) if we can find for each element which pass it belongs to.The key is to determine for each element the number of the sequence (pass) it belongs to, then group them accordingly.How can we compute the pass number for each element?Let&#39;s think. For each element, the pass number is the number of elements before it (in the original array) that are greater than it. Because each such greater element would block it in previous passes.Wait, perhaps that&#39;s the case. Let me see.Take the sample input: 1,3,2,5,4.For element 2 (index 2, value 2):The elements before it are 1 and 3. 3 is greater than 2. So during the first pass, 1 is taken, then 3 is taken. Then 2 is considered, but since the previous in this pass is 3 which is greater, it&#39;s not taken. So 2 must be in the next pass. So the number of elements before it that are greater than it and appear before it in the array (i.e., to the left) and are in the same or earlier passes?Alternatively, the pass number of an element is equal to the number of elements before it (to the left) that are greater than it. Let&#39;s check the sample.Sample 1: element 2 has one element (3) before it that&#39;s greater. So pass number 1+1=2? Wait no. For 2, in the sample, it&#39;s in the second pass. So the count of elements before it that are greater is 1. So maybe the pass number is that count plus 1.Wait, let&#39;s take another example. For the array [4,3,2,1], each element&#39;s pass is:4 is in pass 1.3: elements before it (4) which are greater. Count is 1, so pass 1+1=2?But in the sample output, the sequences are 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. Each in their own pass. So 3&#39;s pass is 2, 2&#39;s pass is 3, etc. So the number of elements before them that are greater than them is their pass number minus 1. For 3, there&#39;s 1 element (4) greater. So 1+1=2. For 2, elements before it are 4 and 3, both greater. So count is 2, pass is 3. For 1, count is 3, pass is 4.So yes, the pass number for each element is equal to the number of elements before it (in the array) that are greater than it, plus 1. Because each of those elements would have to be processed in an earlier pass, thus blocking the current element.So the key is to compute for each element the number of elements before it that are larger than it. Then, the maximum of these counts plus 1 gives the total number of passes.Once we have the pass numbers for each element, we can group them into sequences. Each sequence is formed by the elements in the order they appear in the original array, but only those with the same pass number. But wait, no. Because the way the passes are generated: in each pass, the elements are collected left to right, but only those not used yet. So the order of the sequences in the output is such that all elements of pass 1 come first (in their order in the array), then pass 2 elements in their order, etc.Wait, no. Let me think again. Each pass processes the array left to right, collecting elements that can form an increasing sequence. So for each pass, the elements added to the sequence are those that are the first in this pass or greater than the previous in this pass.But how does the pass number relate to the order of elements?Alternatively, perhaps the pass number can be determined as the number of elements greater than the current one that are to the left and are part of earlier passes. So for each element, the pass number is 1 + the maximum pass number of the elements before it that are greater than it.Wait, this could be a possible approach. Let&#39;s think recursively. For an element a[i], its pass number is 1 plus the maximum pass number of all elements a[j] where j &lt; i and a[j] &gt; a[i]. If there are no such elements, then it&#39;s 1.This would make sense because, for example, in the sample where the array is [4,3,2,1], each element&#39;s pass number is 1 more than the previous element. Let&#39;s see:For 4: no elements before, pass 1.3: elements before are 4, which is greater. The max pass of those elements is 1. So 3&#39;s pass is 2.2: elements before are 4 (pass 1) and 3 (pass 2). Max is 2. So 2&#39;s pass is 3.1: elements before have max pass 3, so 1&#39;s pass is 4.This matches the sample. For the first sample:Elements 1: pass 1 (no elements before).3: elements before (1) which is smaller. So pass 1.2: elements before are 1 and 3. 3 is greater. Its pass is 1. So 2&#39;s pass is 2.5: elements before are 1,3,2. All smaller. So pass 1.4: elements before are 1,3,2,5. 5 is greater. Its pass is 1. So 4&#39;s pass is 2.Which matches the first sample&#39;s output: sequences 1,3,5 (pass 1) and 2,4 (pass 2).So this seems to be the correct approach. So the problem reduces to, for each element, compute the maximum pass number among all elements before it that are greater than it, add 1, and that&#39;s the current element&#39;s pass.Now, how to compute this efficiently?The straightforward approach would be for each element, look at all previous elements that are greater and find their maximum pass. Then add 1. But with n up to 2e5, this would be O(n^2), which is not feasible.So we need a way to compute for each element the maximum pass of elements before it that are larger than it, but in O(n log n) time.This sounds similar to some problems where we need to find for each element the maximum (or something) in the elements before it that are greater. For example, using a Fenwick tree or a segment tree.But the pass numbers can be up to O(n) in the worst case (like the 4,3,2,1 example). So for each element, we need to query the maximum pass in the elements before it that are larger than the current element.How can we model this?An alternative approach is to process the elements in reverse order. Let&#39;s think: for each element, we need to track the maximum pass number among elements that are to the left and greater than it. So if we can, for each possible value (but since the elements are distinct, perhaps we can manage with their sorted order), maintain a data structure that allows querying the maximum pass for elements greater than a certain value.Wait, but the elements are distinct. So we can sort the elements and assign them a rank. Then, for each element, we can use a Fenwick tree (Binary Indexed Tree) or a segment tree that allows us to query the maximum pass number for elements with rank higher than current (since higher rank implies higher value). Then, for each element from left to right:1. Assign a rank based on the sorted array. For example, sort all elements, then assign a unique rank (like coordinate compression).2. For element a[i], the elements greater than a[i] are those with a higher rank. So when processing a[i], we need to query the maximum pass in the range (current rank +1, max_rank).3. Then, the current pass for a[i] is that maximum plus 1. If no such elements exist, then pass is 1.4. Then, we update the data structure with the current a[i]&#39;s rank and its pass.This way, as we process elements left to right, we can efficiently compute the required maximum for each element.Yes, this approach makes sense. Let&#39;s see:For example, in the first sample:Elements are [1,3,2,5,4]. Sorted gives [1,2,3,4,5], so ranks are 1,3,2,5,4.Processing each element in order:1. 1 (rank 1): query max in ranks &gt;1. Since the tree is empty, returns 0. So pass is 0+1=1. Update tree with rank 1, pass 1.2. 3 (rank 3): query max in ranks &gt;3 (i.e., 4,5). No elements. So pass 1. Update tree with 3 → pass 1.3. 2 (rank 2): query ranks &gt;2 (3,4,5). There&#39;s a 3 with pass 1. So max is 1 → pass 2. Update tree with 2 → pass 2.4. 5 (rank 5): query ranks &gt;5 → none. Pass 1. Update tree with 5 → pass 1.5. 4 (rank4): query ranks&gt;4 → 5. Pass 1. So pass 2. Update tree with 4 → pass 2.Which matches the sample pass numbers.Another sample: [4,3,2,1]. Ranks are 4,3,2,1 (since sorted is [1,2,3,4], so the ranks of 4 is 4, 3 is 3, etc.)Processing:1. 4 (rank4): query &gt;4 → none. pass 1. update.2. 3 (rank3): query &gt;3 → 4. pass 1 → pass 2. update.3. 2 (rank2): query &gt;2 →3 and 4. Max pass is 2 (from 3). So pass 3. update.4. 1 (rank1): query &gt;1 → 2,3,4. Max pass is 3 (from 2). So pass 4. update.Which again matches the sample.So this approach works.Now, how to implement this?First, we need to assign ranks based on the sorted elements. Since the elements are distinct, we can sort them and assign a rank from 1 to n. The smallest element gets rank 1, next 2, etc.Then, we need a data structure that can, for a given query (a range of ranks), return the maximum pass in that range, and allow updates (inserting a new rank with a pass value).A Fenwick Tree (BIT) can be used if we can represent the queries as ranges and find the maximum. But standard Fenwick Trees are for prefix sums. For maximum queries, a Fenwick Tree can be used, but only for certain operations.Alternatively, a segment tree that can handle range maximum queries and point updates is suitable here.The steps are:1. Read the array.2. Create a sorted list of the elements, and assign a rank to each element. For example, use a dictionary to map each element to its rank (like, sorted_list.index(elem) + 1).3. For each element in the original array, get its rank.4. Initialize a segment tree (or another structure) that can, given a range [l, r], return the maximum value in that range, and support point updates.5. For each element in the original array (processed left to right):   a. Query the segment tree for the maximum pass in the range (current_rank +1, max_rank). Since ranks are sorted in ascending order, elements with rank &gt; current_rank have values greater than current element.   b. The current element&#39;s pass is max_pass + 1.   c. Update the segment tree at current_rank with the current pass value, but only if it&#39;s higher than the existing value. Because if there was a previous element with the same rank (but that&#39;s impossible here since all elements are distinct), but since all elements are unique, each rank is processed once. Wait, no. Each element has a unique rank. So each point in the segment tree will be updated once. So when processing, we can safely update the position for current_rank with the current pass.6. After processing all elements, collect the pass numbers for each element, then group them in the order of the original array, grouped by their pass numbers.But how to collect the groups? For example, the elements in pass 1 are those with pass 1, and they should appear in the order they were processed (original array order). Then pass 2 elements in original order, etc.So, after computing the pass for each element, we can create a list of lists. Each sublist corresponds to a pass number. Then, for each element in the original array, append it to the sublist of its pass.Once all elements are processed, output each sublist in order (from pass 1 to max_pass), each on a line.So the steps are:- For each element, compute pass.- Create a list of lists. passes = [[] for _ in range(max_pass)]But max_pass can be up to n (as in the 4,3,2,1 case). So for n=2e5, we need to handle that.But in Python, creating a list of lists with up to 2e5 elements is feasible.Alternatively, use a dictionary where keys are pass numbers, and values are lists. Then, after processing all elements, iterate the pass numbers from 1 to max_pass and collect the elements.So, the plan is:- Read n and the array.- Sort the array and assign ranks.- Process each element in the array in order, using a segment tree to track the maximum pass for ranks higher than current.- Collect the pass numbers.- Then, group elements by their pass numbers in the original order.- Output each group&#39;s elements separated by spaces, each group on a new line.Now, the main challenge is implementing the segment tree for range maximum queries and point updates.But in Python, for n up to 2e5, a segment tree with O(n log n) time is acceptable.Wait, but the maximum rank can be up to 2e5 as well. So the size of the segment tree is based on the maximum rank. For example, if the elements are sorted, the ranks are from 1 to n. So the segment tree can be built for size n.So here&#39;s the outline:Implement a segment tree that can:- Query the maximum value in a range [l, r].- Update a position to a new value.Then, for each element in the original array (processed in order):- Get its rank.- Query the segment tree for the maximum in [current_rank + 1, max_rank], which is the maximum pass of elements to the left (since we process left to right) that are larger (higher rank) than current element.- current_pass = max_query + 1.- Update the segment tree at current_rank with current_pass.- Record the current_pass for the element.Once all elements are processed, group the elements by their current_pass in the order of the original array.Now, the segment tree implementation:Implement a standard segment tree for range maximum queries.In Python, implementing a segment tree for 2e5 elements is manageable.Alternatively, use a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree), but standard BITs are for prefix sums. For range max queries, BIT is not straightforward.So the segment tree is the way to go.Let&#39;s code the segment tree.The segment tree can be built with size equal to the maximum rank (which is n). Since all elements are distinct, the ranks are from 1 to n.Wait, yes. Because when sorted, the elements are unique, so each gets a unique rank. So the maximum rank is n.So the segment tree can be initialized with size n, and all nodes initialized to 0. Then, for each element, we query the range [current_rank + 1, n] for the maximum, which gives the maximum pass of elements processed so far (since we process left to right) that are greater than current element.Wait, but elements processed so far? Because when processing left to right, all elements before the current one (in the array) have already been processed. So for the current element, the query is over the ranks of elements that are greater than current (which are those with higher rank), and have been processed (i.e., their data is already in the segment tree). Because we process elements left to right.Yes. So for example, in the first sample, when processing the third element (2, rank 2), the elements before it (1 and 3) have ranks 1 and 3 respectively. So the query is for ranks 3 to n (n=5). The segment tree will have entries for 1 and 3, with pass 1 and 1. So the maximum is 1, so current_pass is 2.Thus, the approach works.Now, code steps:1. Read n and the array.2. Sort the array and assign ranks. Since the array elements can be up to 1e9, but are distinct, we can create a dictionary that maps each element to its rank. For example:sorted_a = sorted(a)rank = {v: i+1 for i, v in enumerate(sorted_a)}3. For each element in the original array, get its rank.ranks = [rank[x] for x in a]4. Initialize the segment tree for size n.5. For each i in 0..n-1:current_rank = ranks[i]query the segment tree for max in [current_rank+1, n]current_pass = query_result + 1update the segment tree at current_rank with current_passstore current_pass in a list passes.6. Group the elements into their passes. For each element in a, append it to the list of its pass.7. For each pass in 1 to max_pass, print the elements separated by space, followed by a space and newline (even if it&#39;s the last element? The sample output shows a trailing space in the first line. For example, the first line is &quot;1 3 5 &quot; with a trailing space. So perhaps we need to print each sequence with a space after each element, including the last one, then a newline.)Wait, looking at the sample input and output:Sample Input 1:51 3 2 5 4Sample Output:1 3 5 2 4 So each line ends with a space. So each sequence is printed with the elements separated by spaces, followed by a space and then a new line. Or perhaps it&#39;s the trailing space. But how to handle that?Alternatively, maybe the sample&#39;s trailing space is a mistake in the problem statement. For example, in the sample input 3, the output is &quot;10 30 50 101 &quot; with four elements and four spaces. But perhaps the code is expected to print each element followed by a space, but that would leave a trailing space. So the correct approach is to join the elements with spaces and then add a space at the end.But that would be odd. Wait, looking at the sample output:The first line is &quot;1 3 5 &quot;, then &quot;2 4 &quot;, etc. So each line ends with a space. So perhaps the problem expects each line to end with a space. So when the elements are [1,3,5], the output line is &quot;1 3 5 &quot;.Thus, in the code, for each sequence, we can print &#39; &#39;.join(map(str, seq)) + &#39; &#39;, then a new line.But perhaps in the sample, the trailing space is part of the required output. So the code should generate each line as a space-separated list of elements followed by a space.But in Python, when you print with end=&#39; &#39;, it may add a space, but for the lines, perhaps the way to do this is to join with spaces and then add a space at the end.Wait, for example, for the sequence [1,3,5], the output line should be &quot;1 3 5 &quot; followed by a new line. So &#39; &#39;.join([&#39;1&#39;,&#39;3&#39;,&#39;5&#39;]) + &#39; &#39;.But in that case, the sample output shows that. So in code, for each group, we can print &#39; &#39;.join(map(str, group)) followed by a space, then a newline.But how to handle empty groups? Well, the groups are from pass 1 to max_pass, and each group is non-empty.Thus, in code:groups = [[] for _ in range(max_pass)]for i in range(n):    groups[passes[i]-1].append(a[i])for group in groups:    print(&#39; &#39;.join(map(str, group)), end=&#39; n&#39;)But the sample output shows that the last element is followed by a space and then a new line. So in Python, when you do print(&#39; &#39;.join(...), end=&#39; n&#39;), the end parameter would be &#39; n&#39;, which adds a space and a new line. Wait, but the default is to add a new line. For example, the sample output lines end with a space and a new line. So for each group, the code should print the elements separated by spaces, followed by a space, then a new line.But how?For example, in the first sample, the first line is &quot;1 3 5 &quot;.So it&#39;s &#39;1 &#39; + &#39;3 &#39; + &#39;5 &#39;.So the code should print each element followed by a space, then a space after the last element.Alternatively, print &#39; &#39;.join(...) followed by a space and then a new line.But that would require:print(&#39; &#39;.join(map(str, group)) + &#39; &#39;)Which would add the trailing space. Then, for each group, this line.Yes, that&#39;s the way to get the sample output.So for group in groups:    line = &#39; &#39;.join(map(str, group)) + &#39; &#39;    print(line)But when the group is empty, but according to the problem statement, each group is non-empty, since each pass is generated only if there are elements.So code steps are:Compute passes for each element.max_pass = max(passes)Create a list of lists, groups, with indices from 0 to max_pass-1.For each element in a, append to groups[pass-1].Then, for each group in groups, print the elements space-separated, with a trailing space and new line.Now, the main part is implementing the segment tree.Implementing a segment tree in Python for range maximum queries and point updates.The segment tree can be built as follows:The tree is represented as a list, with size 2^ceil(log2(n)), or some other approach. But for a maximum of n up to 2e5, we need a tree that can handle up to 2e5 leaves.Alternatively, use a 1-based array for the tree. For n leaves, the size of the tree can be 4*n.Each node represents a certain interval. For each node, we store the maximum value in its interval.The query function for a given range [l, r] returns the maximum in that range.The update function updates a position to a new value, and propagates up the tree.Here&#39;s a possible implementation:class SegmentTree:    def __init__(self, size):        self.n = 1        while self.n &lt; size:            self.n &lt;&lt;=1        self.size = self.n        self.tree = [0] * (2 * self.n)        def update(self, pos, value):        pos += self.n -1  # convert to 0-based index in the leaves        if self.tree[pos] &gt;= value:            return        self.tree[pos] = value        while pos &gt; 1:            pos &gt;&gt;=1            new_val = max(self.tree[2*pos], self.tree[2*pos+1])            if self.tree[pos] == new_val:                break            self.tree[pos] = new_val        def query_max(self, l, r):        res = 0        l += self.n -1        r += self.n -1        while l &lt;= r:            if l %2 ==1:                res = max(res, self.tree[l])                l +=1            if r %2 ==0:                res = max(res, self.tree[r])                r -=1            l &gt;&gt;=1            r &gt;&gt;=1        return resWait, but in this code, the leaves are from 0 to n-1, but the positions passed to update and query are 1-based. For example, if the size is 2e5, then the leaves are stored in the array starting at index self.n.But maybe this code needs to be adjusted.Alternatively, here&#39;s another approach. Let&#39;s use a 1-based index for the nodes. The leaves are from 1 to size, where size is the next power of two after the maximum rank (n). For example, if n is 5, the next power of two is 8. Leaves 1-8, but only 1-5 are used.But maybe this is getting complicated.Alternatively, use a segment tree that is initialized with all zeros and can handle up to n elements.But perhaps a better approach is to use a list-based segment tree. Here&#39;s a possible implementation:The segment tree for range max queries:class SegmentTree:    def __init__(self, max_size):        self.size = 1        while self.size &lt; max_size:            self.size &lt;&lt;= 1        self.data = [0] * (2 * self.size)        def update(self, pos, value):        pos += self.size  # leaves are in [self.size, 2*self.size -1)        if self.data[pos] &gt;= value:            return        self.data[pos] = value        while pos &gt; 1:            pos &gt;&gt;= 1            new_val = max(self.data[2*pos], self.data[2*pos+1])            if self.data[pos] == new_val:                break            self.data[pos] = new_val        def query(self, l, r):        res = 0        l += self.size        r += self.size        while l &lt;= r:            if l %2 ==1:                res = max(res, self.data[l])                l +=1            if r %2 ==0:                res = max(res, self.data[r])                r -=1            l &gt;&gt;=1            r &gt;&gt;=1        return resWait, but in this code, the positions are 0-based. So for a maximum rank of n, the positions passed to update and query are 0-based. Wait, no. For example, if the maximum rank is 5, the leaves are from 0 to 4? Or 1-based? This needs to be clarified.Hmm. Let&#39;s see. For example, when the segment tree is initialized with max_size =5, then size becomes 8 (next power of 2). The leaves are 8 to 8+5-1=12? Or maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding.Alternatively, perhaps the code above uses 1-based indexing for the data. For example, for a segment tree of size 4, the leaves are at positions 4,5,6,7. Then, the code&#39;s update function takes pos as 0-based (e.g., 0 to 3), adds size (4) to get 4,5,6,7.So the code assumes that the positions are 0-based. So for a maximum rank of n, the possible positions are 0 to n-1. So when the ranks are 1-based (1 to n), we need to subtract 1 to make them 0-based.So, when the current_rank is 5 (1-based), the code would pass 4 as the position (0-based).Yes. So during processing, for current_rank (1-based), the code calls update with pos=current_rank-1.Similarly, when querying the range [current_rank+1, n], which in 1-based is (current_rank+1) to n. Converted to 0-based: current_rank to n-1.So for example, current_rank is 2 (1-based), the query is from 3 (current_rank+1=3 in 1-based, which is 2 in 0-based) to n-1 (since n is 5, 0-based is 4). So the query range is 2 to 4 (0-based), which in the segment tree code is l=2, r=4.Thus, the code should process:current_rank = ranks[i] (1-based)so pos in the segment tree is current_rank -1 (0-based).The query is for [current_rank +1, n] (1-based) → [current_rank, n-1] (0-based).Thus, the code for processing each element would be:passes = []for x in a:    rank = rank_dict[x]  # 1-based    # query the range [rank+1, n] (1-based) → [rank, n-1] (0-based)    max_prev = st.query(rank, n-1)    current_pass = max_prev +1    passes.append(current_pass)    st.update(rank-1, current_pass)  # since the segment tree&#39;s pos is 0-based.But wait, the current_rank is 1-based. So the code should:current_rank = rank_dict[x]query_l = current_rank +1 → in 1-based. But the segment tree uses 0-based positions. So for example, current_rank+1 in 1-based is (current_rank+1) -1 = current_rank in 0-based.Wait, the query is for elements with rank greater than current_rank (1-based). So their ranks are current_rank+1 to n (1-based). In 0-based, this is (current_rank) to (n-1).Thus, the code for the query should be:l = current_rank (since current_rank+1 in 1-based is current_rank in 0-based)r = n-1 (since n in 1-based is n-1 in 0-based)Thus, the code for the query is:max_prev = st.query(l, r)So for example, if current_rank is 2 (1-based), then l=2 (0-based 2 is 1-based 3?), wait no. Wait, the rank_dict[x] is 1-based. So current_rank is 2 (1-based). So the query for elements greater than current_rank is current_rank+1 (3) to n in 1-based. Which translates to 2 (3-1) to n-1 (since n is 1-based) in 0-based.Yes. So the code for querying is:current_rank_1based = rank_dict[x]l_0based = current_rank_1based  # since (current_rank_1based +1) -1 = current_rank_1basedr_0based = n_1based -1st.query(l_0based, r_0based)Wait, no. current_rank_1based is the rank of the current element, which is 1-based. Elements greater than it have ranks from current_rank_1based +1 to n_1based. Which in 0-based terms is current_rank_1based to n_1based -1.So yes, the code for querying is:l = current_rank_1basedr = n_1based -1max_prev = st.query(l, r)Then, current_pass is max_prev +1.Then, update the segment tree at current_rank_1based -1 (since the code uses 0-based positions for update) with current_pass.Yes.Thus, the code for processing each element is:for x in a:    r = rank_dict[x]    l = r    r_max = st.query(l, n_1based -1)    current_pass = r_max +1    passes.append(current_pass)    st.update(r-1, current_pass)Thus, the code.Now, let&#39;s test this with the first sample:Sample input 1:n =5array = [1,3,2,5,4]sorted array is [1,2,3,4,5]rank_dict:1 →12 →23 →34 →45 →5Processing each element:1. Element 1, rank 1 (1-based). l=1, r=5-1=4 (0-based). query [1,4] in 0-based (but the segment tree is initialized to 5 elements (n=5). So the code:st = SegmentTree(5). The size is 8 (next power of two after 5 is 8). The code&#39;s query for [1,4] (0-based). Initially, all elements are 0. So the query returns 0. current_pass is 1. Update position 0 (1-based rank 1 → 0-based pos 0) to 1.2. Element 3, rank 3. l=3, r=4. query [3,4]. But the segment tree has only updated position 0 (rank 1 → pos 0) and position 2 (rank 3 → pos 2). Wait no, current_rank is 3 (1-based), so update pos is 3-1=2. So after first update, pos 0 is 1.So when processing element 3 (rank 3):l=3 (0-based), r=4.But initially, no elements are in the segment tree except pos 0 (rank 1). So querying 3-4 returns 0. So current_pass is 1. Then, update pos 2 (3-1=2) to 1.3. Element 2, rank 2. l=2 (0-based). r=4.The segment tree has pos 0 (1), pos 2 (1). Now, query [2,4]. The data includes pos 2 (value 1), but what about positions 3 and 4 (0-based)? They are 0. So the maximum is 1. So current_pass is 2. Update pos 1 (rank 2-1=1) with 2.4. Element5, rank5. l=5, but n=5, which is 1-based. So 5 in 0-based is 4. So l=5-1=4 (since the query for l=5 (1-based) → 0-based 4. So query [4,4]. Initially, no elements there. So returns 0. current_pass=1. Update pos 4 (5-1=4) with 1.5. Element4, rank4. l=4 (0-based 4). query [4,4]. There&#39;s a previous update for 4 (element5&#39;s rank 5 was processed earlier). Wait, no. Element5&#39;s rank is 5 (1-based). So in update, pos 5-1=4. So after element5 is processed, pos4 is updated to 1. Now, element4 has rank4 (1-based). l=4 (0-based), r=4. So query [4,4] (0-based) returns 1. current_pass=1+1=2. Update pos3 (4-1=3) to 2.Thus, passes are [1,1,2,1,2]. So groups are:pass 1: elements 1,3,5 → indices 0,1,3.pass 2: elements 2,4 → indices 2,4.Which matches the sample.Great.Now, the code for the segment tree and processing.Now, in Python, implementing the segment tree with this approach:class SegmentTree:    def __init__(self, max_size):        self.size = 1        while self.size &lt; max_size:            self.size &lt;&lt;=1        self.data = [0] * (2 * self.size)        def update(self, pos, value):        # pos is 0-based        pos += self.size        if self.data[pos] &gt;= value:            return        self.data[pos] = value        while pos &gt;1:            pos &gt;&gt;=1            new_val = max(self.data[2*pos], self.data[2*pos+1])            if self.data[pos] == new_val:                break            self.data[pos] = new_val        def query(self, l, r):        # l and r are 0-based, inclusive        res = 0        l += self.size        r += self.size        while l &lt;= r:            if l %2 ==1:                res = max(res, self.data[l])                l +=1            if r %2 ==0:                res = max(res, self.data[r])                r -=1            l &gt;&gt;=1            r &gt;&gt;=1        return resThen, the code for processing:n = int(input())a = list(map(int, input().split()))sorted_a = sorted(a)rank_dict = {v:i+1 for i, v in enumerate(sorted_a)}  # 1-based ranksranks = [rank_dict[x] for x in a]st = SegmentTree(n)passes = []for r in ranks:    # query from r to n (1-based), which is (r) to (n) in 1-based → (r-1) to (n-1) in 0-based.    # Wait, wait. r is the current element&#39;s rank (1-based). We need to find elements with rank &gt; r (1-based), which is elements with rank &gt;= r+1 (1-based). So in 0-based, ranks are r to n-1 (since r+1 in 1-based is r in 0-based, and n in 1-based is n-1 in 0-based).    l_query = r  # 1-based r+1 → 0-based r    r_query = n  # 1-based n → 0-based n-1    # convert to 0-based:    l_0 = l_query    r_0 = n-1    max_prev = st.query(l_0, r_0)    current_pass = max_prev +1    passes.append(current_pass)    # update the segment tree at position (r-1) (since rank is 1-based)    st.update(r-1, current_pass)# Now group the elements by their passmax_pass = max(passes)groups = [[] for _ in range(max_pass)]for i in range(n):    groups[passes[i]-1].append(str(a[i]))for group in groups:    print(&#39; &#39;.join(group) + &#39; &#39;)Wait, but the query in the code is st.query(l_0, r_0), where l_0 is r (the current_rank 1-based). For example, if current_rank is 1 (1-based), then l_0=1, r_0=4 (if n=5). But in the segment tree, the leaves are 0-based. So for n=5, the leaves are 0..4. So when current_rank is 1 (1-based), l_0=1 (0-based) which is the second leaf. So querying from 1 to 4 (0-based) will include elements with ranks 2,3,4,5 (1-based).Yes. Because 1-based rank 1&#39;s next rank is 2, which is 1-based, but in 0-based that&#39;s 1.Thus, the code for the query should use l_0 = r (1-based), which is the 0-based start of the query.But wait, current_rank is 1-based, so for example, for rank 3 (1-based), we need to query ranks &gt;=4 (1-based). Which is 4,5, etc. In 0-based, 4-1=3, 5-1=4. So the query is from 3 to n-1 (0-based).Thus, the code correctly sets l_0 = r (1-based current_rank), which is the 0-based start of the query.Thus, the code is correct.Now, test the code with sample input 2:Sample Input 2:44 3 2 1Sample Output:4 3 2 1 Processing:ranks are 4,3,2,1 (since sorted is [1,2,3,4], so 4 is 4, 3 is 3, etc.)st is initialized for max_size=4.Processing each element:1. element4, rank4 (1-based). l_0 =4. But max_size is4. Wait, the problem here is that in the code, n is the input n (4 in this case). So when building the segment tree, max_size is 4. So the segment tree can handle ranks up to 4 (1-based) which are 0-based 0-3.Wait, no. Because in this case, ranks are 4,3,2,1. So when the code initializes the segment tree with max_size =4 (n=4), the segment tree can handle positions 0-based up to 3 (since max_size is4, which is the size of the leaves). But in this case, the current_rank is4, which is 1-based, so when converting to 0-based, it&#39;s 3. So when processing the first element (4, rank4):l_0 =4 (1-based rank4) → which is 3 in 0-based.r_0 =4-1=3 (since n=4, 1-based n is4, 0-based is3).So query is from 3 to3 (0-based). Initially, the segment tree is all zeros. So max_prev is0. current_pass=1. Update position 3 (rank4-1=3) to1.Second element:3, rank3 (1-based). l_0=3 (0-based 2). r_0=3. query [2,3]. The segment tree has 0 in those positions except position3 (value1). So the maximum is1. current_pass=2. Update position2 (3-1=2) with2.Third element:2, rank2 (1-based). l_0=2 (0-based1). r_0=3. query [1,3]. The segment tree has positions2 (2), 3 (1). So the maximum is2. current_pass=3. Update position1 (2-1=1) to3.Fourth element:1, rank1 (1-based). l_0=1 (0-based0). r_0=3. query [0,3]. The elements are position0 (0), position1 (3), position2 (2), position3 (1). So maximum is3. current_pass=4. Update position0 (1-1=0) to4.Thus, passes are [1,2,3,4].Groups:Group0: [4]Group1: [3]Group2: [2]Group3: [1]Each printed with trailing space. Which matches the sample output.Another sample input:410 30 50 101Sample Output:10 30 50 101 The elements are already sorted. So ranks are 1,2,3,4.Processing each element:For 10, rank1. query [1,3] (0-based). No elements. pass1.Update pos0 to1.30: rank2. query [2,3] →0. pass1. update pos1 to1.50: rank3. query [3,3] →0. pass1. update pos2 to1.101: rank4. query [4,3] → which is invalid. Wait, wait. n=4. So in this case, during processing the fourth element:current_rank is4 (1-based).l_0 =4 (0-based3).r_0 =4-1=3 (since n=4).So the query is from3 to3.But the segment tree has been updated with pos3 (since 101&#39;s rank is4, which is 0-based3) after the update.Wait, let&#39;s step through:n=4, so the segment tree is initialized with max_size=4.First element:10, rank1. l_0=1 (0-based0+1?), no.Wait, no. For the first element, rank is1 (1-based). So l_0 is1 (since query is for elements with rank &gt;1). But wait, the code computes l_0 as r (the current_rank in 1-based). Because the current_rank is1, and the query is for elements with rank &gt;1.So the query should be from current_rank+1 (2) to n (4), in 1-based. Which is 2-4. In 0-based, that&#39;s 1-3.So l_0 = current_rank →1 (1-based) becomes 0-based1-1=1-1=0+1? No. Wait, the code has:r is current_rank_1based.For example, current_rank is1 (1-based). The code computes l_0 = r (current_rank_1based=1). Then, r_0 = n-1 (4-1=3). So the query is from1 to3 (0-based), which are ranks2,3,4 in 1-based.But in the code, the first element&#39;s rank is1 (1-based). l_0=1, r_0=3.But in the segment tree, nothing has been updated yet. So the query returns0. So current_pass=1. Then update position0 (current_rank-1=0) with1.Second element:30, rank2. l_0=2 (1-based), r_0=3. query [2,3] →0. current_pass=1. update pos1 (2-1=1) with1.Third element:50, rank3. l_0=3 (1-based), r_0=3. query [3,3] →0. current_pass=1. update pos2 (3-1=2) with1.Fourth element:101, rank4. l_0=4 (1-based) → which is3 in 0-based. r_0=3. So query [3,3] →0. current_pass=1. update pos3 (4-1=3) with1.Thus, all elements are pass1. So the group is all elements in order. Which matches the sample.Thus, the code works.Now, let&#39;s code this in Python.But wait, the code for the query in the SegmentTree class uses l and r in 0-based. For the first sample where the code for the first element (rank1) is:l_0=1 (0-based), r_0=3 (since n=5, 1-based, so n-1=4 (0-based? Wait, no, n is 5. So for the first sample:n=5. current_rank is1 (1-based). l_0=1, r_0=5-1=4.So query [1,4]. But the segment tree&#39;s leaves are from 0 to4 (since max_size=5). So the code&#39;s query would return the maximum in that range.Yes.But in the SegmentTree&#39;s query function, l and r are the 0-based positions. So the code should work.Now, code:But in Python, for n up to 2e5, the SegmentTree&#39;s data array will be of size 2 * 2^ceil(log2(2e5)), which is manageable.Now, the code:Read n.Read the array.Sort the array, create rank_dict.Process each element as per the code.Group elements and print.So the code should be correct.Now, let&#39;s code it.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine how Ivan&#39;s array can be split into increasing sequences according to a specific algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly forms increasing sequences by iterating through the array from left to right, collecting unused numbers that form an increasing sequence in each pass. The goal is to efficiently determine which elements belong to each pass and output these sequences. Approach1. Rank Assignment: Assign a rank to each element based on its value when the array is sorted. This helps in efficiently determining the relative order of elements.2. Segment Tree: Use a segment tree to keep track of the maximum pass number for elements greater than the current element. This allows us to efficiently query the maximum pass number of elements that are greater than the current element and have been processed so far.3. Pass Calculation: For each element, determine its pass number by querying the segment tree for the maximum pass number of elements with higher ranks (greater values) that have been processed. The current element&#39;s pass number is one more than this maximum.4. Grouping Elements: Group elements based on their calculated pass numbers and output these groups in the order they were formed.

Rank Assignment: Each element is assigned a rank based on its position in the sorted array. This helps in efficiently comparing elements.2. Segment Tree: The segment tree is used to maintain and query the maximum pass number for elements greater than the current element. This allows us to determine the correct pass number for each element in logarithmic time.3. Pass Calculation: For each element, the pass number is determined by querying the segment tree for the maximum pass number of elements with higher ranks. This pass number is incremented by 1 to get the current element&#39;s pass.4. Grouping and Output: Elements are grouped by their calculated pass numbers and printed in the order they appear in the original array, ensuring the correct sequence for each pass.This approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the solution runs in O(n log n) time, making it suitable for large input sizes.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c068b9fe data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review" data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review-title" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>❓:</span>There are a lot of things which could be cut — trees, paper, &quot;the rope&quot;. In this problem you are going to cut a sequence of integers.There is a sequence of integers, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers. Given a limited budget, you need to make maximum possible number of cuts such that each resulting segment will have the same number of odd and even integers.Cuts separate a sequence to continuous (contiguous) segments. You may think about each cut as a break between two adjacent elements in a sequence. So after cutting each element belongs to exactly one segment. Say, [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5] to two cuts to [4, 1 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 4, 4, 5, 5].

The problem is about cutting a sequence of integers into segments where each segment has an equal number of even and odd numbers. And we need to do this with the maximum number of cuts possible without exceeding the budget B. The cost of each cut is the absolute difference between the two adjacent elements. So the challenge is to find all possible valid cut points, determine which ones to use in order to maximize the number of cuts under the budget.First, I need to understand the conditions for a valid cut. Each segment must have the same number of evens and odds. Since the entire sequence already has equal numbers, maybe the cuts can only be made at certain points where the cumulative evens and odds up to that point are equal. So the idea is to find all possible positions where a cut can be made such that the prefix up to that position has a balanced count of even and odd numbers. Then, those cuts can be candidates.So the first step is to compute the cumulative even and odd counts as we go through the sequence. For each possible cut position (between i and i+1 elements), we check if up to that point, the number of evens and odds are equal. If yes, then that&#39;s a possible cut point.Once we have all the possible cut positions, the next step is to select a subset of them such that the sum of their costs (which is the absolute difference between the adjacent elements) is &lt;= B, and the number of cuts is maximized.But wait, since each cut divides the sequence into segments, the positions of the cuts must be such that each segment between cuts is balanced. So the valid cuts are those positions where the cumulative balance up to that point is zero. But how do the cumulative counts work here?Let&#39;s think. The entire sequence has even and odd counts equal. So suppose after the first k elements, the counts are equal. Then, the first segment is the first k elements, and the next segment starts from k+1. Then, in the next segment, we again need a cumulative balance at some point. So the valid cuts are positions where the cumulative balance (even - odd) is zero. Each time we reach a balance of zero, we can make a cut there. So the possible cut points are those indices where the cumulative count of even and odd numbers up to that index (inclusive) is equal.For example, in the sample input 1:1 2 5 10 15 20Let&#39;s compute the cumulative even and odd counts:Index 0: element 1 (odd) → even:0, odd:1 → balance -1Index 1: 2 (even) → even:1, odd:1 → balance 0 → possible cut after index 1 (between 1 and 2)Index 2: 5 (odd) → even:1, odd:2 → balance -1Index 3: 10 (even) → even:2, odd:2 → balance 0 → possible cut after index 3 (between 3 and 4)Index 4:15 (odd) → even:2, odd:3 → balance -1Index 5:20 (even) → even:3, odd:3 → balance 0. But since the entire sequence is of even and odd counts equal, this is the end.Wait, but the sample input 1 has 6 elements. The possible cuts are between index 1 and 2 (cost |2-5|=3), between 3 and4 (10 and15, cost 5), and between 5 and6 (but that&#39;s the end, which is not considered a cut. Wait, the cuts are the breaks between elements. So for a sequence of 6 elements, there are 5 possible cut positions (indices 0 to 5 between elements 1-2, 2-5, etc. Wait, maybe I should index the cut positions as between a[i] and a[i+1]. So for n elements, there are n-1 possible cut positions. So in sample input 1, n=6, so 5 possible positions. Let&#39;s re-express the sample input:Sample Input 1:6 41 2 5 10 15 20The possible cuts where the cumulative balance is zero are after index 1 (cut between 2 and5), after index3 (cut between 10 and15), and after index5 (but that&#39;s the end, so not a cut. So wait, the first two possible cuts are positions 1 and 3. So the possible cuts are at positions 1 and 3. The cost of the first cut is |2-5|=3, the cost of the second is |10-15|=5.The budget is B=4. So we can choose either to take the first cut (cost 3) which allows 1 cut. If we take both, sum is 3+5=8&gt;4. So the maximum is 1, which matches the sample output.So the steps are:1. Find all possible cut positions where the cumulative even and odd counts up to that point are equal. These are the positions where a cut can be made, splitting the sequence into a segment up to that point, which is balanced, and the remaining sequence.2. For each such possible cut position, calculate the cost (absolute difference of the two elements adjacent to the cut).3. Then, select a subset of these cuts such that the sum of their costs is &lt;= B, and the number of cuts is maximized. The order of cuts must be such that the positions are in order, but since the cuts are made between elements, the positions must be non-overlapping. For example, if a cut is made at position i, then the next possible cut must be at a position j &gt; i, but only after the next segment. Wait, no. Because each cut splits the sequence into parts. Each subsequent cut can be in the next segment. Wait, the problem says that after all cuts, each segment must have even and odd counts equal. So the cuts must partition the sequence into segments, each of which is balanced. So the way to do this is that each cut must be at a position where the cumulative count up to that point is balanced, and the remaining segments after that are also balanced.Wait, but how to ensure that when we make a cut at position i, the rest of the sequence can also form valid segments. For example, suppose after the first cut at position i, the remaining part (from i+1 to end) must also have even and odd counts equal. Because each segment must have equal counts. So the sum of the segments must equal the total, which is even and odd counts equal.Wait, but the entire sequence has equal counts. So if we split the sequence into two parts, each part must have equal counts. Because the total even and odd are equal. So when we split into segments, each must have even and odd counts equal. Therefore, the first cut must be at a position where the cumulative counts are equal (so the first segment is balanced), and the remaining part (the rest of the sequence) must also have even and odd counts equal. But since the total is equal, the remaining part will automatically have equal counts if the first part does. Because total even = total odd. So if the first part has E evens and O odds, E=O, then the remaining part will have (total E - E) = (total O - O) = (E_total - E). Which since E=O, and total E = total O, this will be equal.So, the possible cuts are all the positions where the cumulative counts up to that point are equal. Each such position can be a candidate, but after cutting there, the remaining sequence is split into parts which also have equal counts. So the entire problem reduces to finding all possible positions where the cumulative balance is zero, and then selecting a subset of these positions (sorted in order) such that the sum of their costs is within B. Each cut can be made, and each cut must be made in the order of their positions (since you can&#39;t cut at a later position before an earlier one).Wait, but the cuts are made in the original sequence. For example, if the valid cut positions are at i and j (i &lt; j), then if you cut at i, then the next possible cuts in the remaining part of the sequence (after i) must be found again. Wait, but maybe the way to model this is that all possible valid cut positions are the points where the cumulative balance is zero. Then, the selection of these positions must be such that they form a partition of the entire sequence into segments. So the cuts can be made in any order, but the positions must be in order. For example, you can&#39;t cut at position j before cutting at i, where j &gt; i, unless i is not a valid cut point. Wait, no, because each cut is made in the original sequence, not in the segments. So the order in which you make cuts doesn&#39;t matter. Once a cut is made, the sequence is split into two parts, and each part can be split again. But in this problem, since all the valid cut points are those where the cumulative balance up to that point is zero, making a cut at position i allows the rest of the sequence (from i+1 to end) to have their own valid cuts. So, the possible cuts are all the positions where the cumulative balance is zero. Then, the problem is to select a subset of these positions (sorted in order) such that the sum of their costs is &lt;= B, and the number of cuts is maximum.So the key steps are:1. Precompute all possible cut positions (indices between elements) where the cumulative even and odd counts up to that index (the elements before the cut) are equal.2. For each such cut position, calculate the cost (|x - y| where x is the element before the cut, y is after).3. Then, select a subset of these cuts in order (since they have to be made between elements in the original sequence in order) such that the sum of their costs is &lt;= B, and the number of cuts is as large as possible.This is similar to the classic knapsack problem where you select items (cuts) to maximize the count, with the sum of their weights (costs) not exceeding B. However, in this case, the order of the cuts is not important because once a cut is made at a position, the other cuts must be in the same sequence. Wait, but the cuts are made in the original sequence. For example, if there are two possible cut positions at i and j, where i &lt; j, and you can choose to take both, but their sum of costs must be &lt;= B. However, if you take both, that splits the sequence into three parts. Each part must have even and odd counts equal, which is guaranteed by the fact that each cut is at a balance-zero position.So the problem reduces to selecting a subset of the possible cuts (with their costs) such that the sum of the costs is &lt;= B, and the number of cuts is maximized. However, since the cuts must be made in order (i.e., you can&#39;t make a cut at position j if you already made a cut at a position i &gt; j), but wait, the cuts are between elements. So the positions are ordered. For example, the cut positions are in the order they appear in the sequence. So if you have possible cuts at positions 1,3,5, then you can select to take 1 and 5 (if their sum is within B), but the actual cuts would split the sequence into segments. But each of those segments must also be valid. However, the cuts at 1 and 5 would split the sequence into [0-1], [2-5], [6-end]. But the middle segment [2-5] must have even and odd counts equal. So how is that ensured?Ah, because each cut position is a point where the cumulative balance up to that point is zero. So, for example, if you make cuts at positions i and j (i &lt; j), the first cut splits the sequence into [0-i] and [i+1 - end]. The second cut is in the second part. But in the second part, the cumulative balance up to j (relative to the start of the second part) must be zero. Wait, but how do we ensure that?Wait, perhaps the approach is that the valid cut positions are all positions in the original sequence where the cumulative balance up to that position is zero. Then, any subset of these positions (in order) will split the sequence into segments, each of which has a cumulative balance of zero (since the cumulative up to the first cut is zero, the next segment&#39;s cumulative up to the next cut is zero when considering the entire sequence, but in the next segment, the cumulative starts from the first cut&#39;s end. Wait, maybe not.Wait, the key insight here is that the sum of even and odd in each segment must be equal. The entire sequence has even and odd counts equal. When we split the sequence into two parts at a position where the first part has even and odd counts equal, the remaining part must also have even and odd counts equal. Because total even = total odd, so if first part is even=odd, then the remaining part is (total even - first even) = (total odd - first odd) → which is equal since first even = first odd.So, any cut made in the original sequence at a position where the cumulative up to that point is zero will split the sequence into two parts, each of which has even and odd counts equal. Then, each of those parts can be split again into parts by making cuts at their own positions where their cumulative counts are zero. However, those positions in the original sequence may not be the same as the positions where the cumulative in the entire sequence is zero.Wait, no. Because the positions where the cumulative up to that point (in the entire sequence) is zero are the valid cut points for splitting the entire sequence. But the splits of the subsequent parts may require their own cumulative counts to be zero. But since the subsequent parts themselves are parts of the original sequence, the cumulative counts in their own segments may not be zero. For example, suppose the original sequence is split at position i. The next segment is from i+1 to j, which must have even and odd counts equal. But in terms of the original sequence, the cumulative counts up to j is zero. So the entire sequence&#39;s cumulative up to j is zero, which implies that the first part (up to i) has even=odd, and the entire sequence up to j also has even=odd. Therefore, the part from i+1 to j must have even=odd counts as well. Because the total up to j is even=odd (0), and up to i is even=odd (0), so the difference (i+1 to j) is even=odd.Ah, right! So when you split the original sequence into parts by making cuts at positions where the cumulative up to that position is zero, then each of the resulting segments will have even=odd counts. Because the entire sequence&#39;s cumulative up to each cut is zero, so each segment is between two such cuts, and the counts in each segment are even=odd.So, the valid cuts are all the positions in the original sequence where the cumulative even and odd counts up to that position are equal. Once we collect all such positions (excluding the end of the sequence, since that&#39;s not a cut), we can select any subset of them, ordered from left to right, and each subset of cuts will split the sequence into valid segments. The order of the cuts must be such that they are in the order of their positions (since you can&#39;t cut after a later position first).So the problem now is to select a subset of these cut positions (sorted by their order in the sequence) such that the sum of their costs is &lt;= B, and the number of cuts is as large as possible.This is similar to the classic 0/1 knapsack problem, but here we are trying to maximize the number of items (cuts) selected, with their total cost &lt;= B. However, the order of the cuts doesn&#39;t matter in the sense that you can select any subset of the possible cuts (as long as they are in order, but since the cuts are sorted in order, the selection is just a subset in order). So the solution is to collect all possible cut positions, sort them in order (they are already in order as per the sequence), and select a subset of them, possibly with any combination, to maximize the count.But since we want to maximize the number of cuts, the optimal strategy is to select the cuts with the smallest possible costs first. Because each cut adds 1 to the count, and we need to minimize the sum of costs. So the approach is:1. Collect all possible cut positions (where the cumulative balance is zero).2. Collect their costs.3. Sort these costs in ascending order.4. Select as many as possible starting from the smallest until the sum exceeds B.This is a greedy approach. But is this always correct? Because in some cases, choosing a higher cost cut early might allow more cuts to be selected later. Wait, no. Because each cut&#39;s cost is independent of others, and we need to maximize the number of cuts. Since each cut contributes exactly 1 to the count, the maximum number is achieved by selecting as many as possible, which would require choosing the cuts with the least cost first.Yes. For example, suppose we have three cuts with costs 1, 2, 3 and B=3. If we take 1 and 2, sum is 3, which allows two cuts. If we take 3, sum is 3, allows one cut. So the greedy approach is better.Therefore, the algorithm is:- Find all possible cut positions (balance zero) and their costs.- Sort the costs in ascending order.- Take as many as possible starting from the smallest, adding their costs until the sum exceeds B. The maximum number of cuts is the number of elements taken before the sum exceeds B.But wait, the positions must be in order. Because, for example, if you have two cuts at positions 2 and 3 (adjacent), can you make both? Well, if you have a cut between elements 2 and 3, and between 3 and4, then the sequence is split into three parts. Each of the two cuts is in the original sequence. So, the order of the cuts is determined by their positions. However, in the list of possible cuts, the positions are sorted in the order they appear. So when you select them in the order of increasing cost, you might select cuts that are not in order. But the problem is that the cuts need to be made in the original sequence in such a way that each subsequent cut is made in a segment that exists after previous cuts.Wait, but the cuts are made in the original sequence. So for example, if there are two possible cuts at positions 1 and 3. If you cut at 3 first, then position 1 is still present in the original sequence, but after cutting at 3, the sequence is split into two parts. The first part is up to 3, and the second part is after. So cutting at 1 would split the first part. But in our problem, the cuts are made between elements of the original sequence, not the segments. So, the cuts can be made in any order. Wait, no. Because after making a cut at position 3, the next cuts must be in the remaining parts. But the original possible cut positions are positions in the original sequence. So for example, if a cut is made at position 3, then the next cut can be made at position 1, but that would split the first part again. But in the original problem, the cuts are made between elements, and the order in which they are made is not relevant. For example, the sequence [a, b, c, d] with possible cuts at positions 1 and 2. If you make cuts at 1 and 2, the sequence is split into [a | b | c | d]. So the order of cuts doesn&#39;t matter. Each cut is made in the original sequence. So the positions must be in order, but the selection of cuts can be any subset of the possible positions. However, if you select a subset of positions that are not in order (like positions 3 and 1), then that&#39;s impossible. So the possible cuts must be selected in the order of their positions, and they must be non-overlapping. Wait, but how?Wait, each cut is a position between two elements. So the positions are 0-based indices between elements. For example, in a sequence of n elements, the positions are 0 to n-2 (since between element 0 and 1 is position 0, between 1 and 2 is position 1, etc.). So for the original sequence, any subset of these positions can be chosen, but they must be such that the segments they form are balanced. However, according to the problem&#39;s condition, the cuts are valid if each segment has even and odd counts equal. This is ensured by the fact that the cut positions are those where the cumulative balance in the entire sequence up to that point is zero.But if two cuts are made at positions i and j, where i &lt; j, then the first split is at i, the next at j. The first split creates two segments: 0..i and i+1..end. The second split is in the second segment, but in the original sequence, the split at j would split the original sequence into 0..j and j+1..end. Wait, that&#39;s not possible. Because when you make a split at j, you&#39;re splitting the entire sequence, not just a segment. So the problem here is that the cuts are made in the original sequence, and each cut must split the entire sequence into parts where each part has even and odd counts equal.But if you have two cuts, say at i and j (i &lt; j), then the first cut splits the sequence into [0..i] and [i+1..end]. The second cut splits [i+1..end] into [i+1..j] and [j+1..end], but only if j is a valid cut position in the original sequence. Wait, no. Because the cumulative up to j is zero in the entire sequence, so the split at j in the entire sequence is valid. But the split at j would split the entire sequence into [0..j] and [j+1..end], but the first split is already at i. So this would split the entire sequence into three parts: [0..i], [i+1..j], [j+1..end], but each of these parts must have even and odd counts equal.But how is that possible? Because the cumulative up to i is zero (even=odd), cumulative up to j is zero (even=odd). So the total even up to j is equal to total odd. The first segment is even=odd. The second segment (i+1 to j) must also be even=odd. Because the cumulative up to j is the sum of the first segment (even=odd) and the second segment (even=odd). So the entire sequence is split into three segments, each with even=odd counts.Therefore, making multiple cuts at positions i and j (i &lt; j) is allowed, as long as each position is a valid cut point (cumulative balance zero in the original sequence). So the cuts can be made in any order, but their positions must be in the order of the original sequence. So the subset of cuts must be sorted in increasing order of positions, but their selection is such that the sum of their costs is &lt;= B.But in this case, when you select a subset of cuts, the positions must be in order, but the way they split the sequence into segments is automatically handled by the positions. So the cuts can be made in any subset of the possible positions, as long as the positions are sorted.So the problem reduces to selecting a subset of possible cuts (sorted by position) where the sum of their costs is &lt;= B, and the number of cuts is maximized. However, the positions are already sorted (since we process the sequence left to right), so the possible cuts are in order. For example, if we have cuts at positions 1,3,5, then the possible subsets are any combination, but they must be in order. So the selection can include any subset of these positions, and the order of the cuts is already enforced by their positions.Therefore, the optimal way to maximize the number of cuts is to select as many cuts as possible with the smallest costs. Because each cut contributes +1 to the count, and we need to minimize the sum of costs. So the greedy approach of selecting the cuts with the smallest cost first will yield the maximum number of cuts possible.Thus, the steps are:1. Compute all possible cut positions where the cumulative even and odd counts up to that position are equal.2. For each such position, compute the cost (abs difference between adjacent elements).3. Sort these costs in ascending order.4. Accumulate the costs from smallest to largest, counting how many can be added before the sum exceeds B.The maximum count is the answer.Let&#39;s test this approach against the sample inputs.Sample Input 1:6 41 2 5 10 15 20Possible cut positions:After index 0: cumulative even=0, odd=1 → balance -1 → no.After index 1: elements 1 (odd) and 2 (even) → cumulative even=1, odd=1 → balance 0. So cut at position 1 (between index 1 and 2). Cost is |2 -5| =3.After index 2: elements up to index 2 are 1,2,5 → even=1 (2), odd=2 (1 and5) → balance -1.After index3: elements up to 3 are 1,2,5,10 → even=2 (2,10), odd=2 (1,5) → balance 0. Cut at position3. Cost is |10 -15|=5.After index4: elements up to4: 15 is odd. Even count 2, odd count3. Balance -1.So possible cuts are positions 1 and 3. Costs 3 and5. Sorted: 3,5. Summing 3 gives total 3 &lt;=4 → 1 cut. Summing 3+5=8&gt;4. So maximum is1. Which matches the sample output.Sample Input 2:4 101 3 2 4Check cumulative even/odd counts:After index0: 1 (odd) → even 0, odd1 → balance-1.After index1:1,3 → both odd → even0, odd2 → balance-2.After index2:1,3,2 → even1, odd2 → balance-1.After index3:1,3,2,4 → even2, odd2 → balance0. So possible cut at position3 (between index3 and4). But that&#39;s the end of the sequence. So no possible cuts except after index3. But making a cut there would split the sequence into [1,3,2,4] and nothing else. So the possible cut is at position3 (end of sequence?), which is not allowed. So the possible cuts are none. So output is0. Which matches the sample.Sample Input3:6 1001 2 3 4 5 6Possible cuts:Let&#39;s compute cumulative even and odd:element1 (1) → odd=1, even=0 → balance-1.element2 (2) → even=1 → balance0 → cut at position1 (between 2 and3). Cost |2-3|=1.element3 (3) → odd=2 → even=1 → balance-1.element4 (4) → even=2 → balance0 → cut at position3 (between4 and5). Cost |4-5|=1.element5 (5) → odd=3 → even=2 → balance-1.element6 (6) → even=3 → balance0. Cut at position5. But that&#39;s the end, so not allowed.So possible cuts are positions1 and3. Costs 1 and1. Total sum is 2, which is &lt;=100. So maximum cuts is2. Which matches the sample output.So the approach works for the samples.Therefore, the steps for the code are:- Read n and B.- Read the array a.- Compute the possible cut positions and their costs.- Sort the costs in ascending order.- Sum as many as possible starting from the smallest until B is exceeded.Now, code steps:Implement the steps.First, iterate through the array, compute cumulative even and odd counts.For each possible cut position between i and i+1, check the cumulative up to i (since the cut after i is the split between i and i+1). So for each index i from 0 to n-2 (since cut positions are 0 to n-2), compute the even and odd counts from the start to i (inclusive). If even == odd, then this is a valid cut position. Compute the cost as |a[i] - a[i+1]|.Collect all such costs.Sort the list.Then, greedily take the smallest costs first.Now, code:Read n and B.a = list of integers.Compute the possible cuts:cuts = []current_even = 0current_odd = 0for i in range(n):    if a[i] %2 ==0:        current_even +=1    else:        current_odd +=1    if i &lt; n-1:  # because the cut is between i and i+1, so after processing i, check if up to i it&#39;s balanced.        if current_even == current_odd:            cost = abs(a[i] - a[i+1])            cuts.append(cost)Sort cuts.sum_cost =0count =0for cost in sorted(cuts):    if sum_cost + cost &lt;= B:        sum_cost += cost        count +=1    else:        breakprint(count)Wait, but in the sample input3, the cuts are positions1 and3 (costs1 and1). Sorted, sum 2. So count is2.In sample input1, cuts are [3,5], sorted [3,5], sum 3 is 3 &lt;=4 → count1. The sample output is1. Correct.Sample input2: no cuts, so count0.Yes.So the code seems correct.But what about cases where there are multiple cuts and overlapping?Wait, for example, if the sequence allows for cuts at positions1,2,3. Then, including all possible cuts. But according to the code, they are sorted by cost. So even if positions are 1,2,3 with costs 5,1,10. The code will take the cut at2 (cost1) first, then position1 (cost5) → sum 6, but then position3&#39;s cost10 may be added. Wait, but the code sorts all the costs, so the order is 1,5,10. So in the code, they are added in that order, which is the optimal way. However, the positions are in the original sequence. But in the code, the cuts are made in the original sequence&#39;s positions. But the code&#39;s approach is to take the cuts with the smallest costs, regardless of their order. However, in reality, the order of the cuts in the sequence doesn&#39;t matter, as each cut is between elements and can be made in any order, but they must be made at their positions in the original sequence. However, the problem is that when you make a cut at position j, you can&#39;t make a cut at position i &lt; j afterward, because the sequence is already split into parts. Wait, no. Because the cuts are made between elements. So making a cut at position j and then at position i &lt;j would split the sequence into three parts: up to i, i+1 to j, j+1 to end. But each of those must have even=odd counts. But according to the way the code collects cuts, these positions are all in the original sequence where the cumulative up to that position is zero. So even if i&lt;j, the cuts at i and j would split the sequence into three parts. The first part (0 to i) has even=odd. The second part (i+1 to j) is even=odd. The third part (j+1 to end) is even=odd. Because the cumulative up to j is even=odd. So the code&#39;s approach is correct.But in the code, the cuts are added in the order of their costs, not their positions. However, the code doesn&#39;t track their positions. So if the code selects two cuts at positions j and i (j &gt;i), but in the code&#39;s sorted list, the cost of j is smaller than i, then the code will take j first, then i. But in reality, the cuts are made in the original sequence. But since the cuts are made between elements, the order of the cuts does not affect the total sum. For example, making cuts at i and j (i &lt;j) in any order results in the same segments. So the code&#39;s approach of considering the sum of the costs (without considering the order of the cuts) is correct. Because the sum of the costs is the same regardless of the order in which the cuts are made.So the code&#39;s approach is correct.Therefore, the code can be written as follows.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of cuts that can be made on a sequence of integers such that each resulting segment has an equal number of even and odd integers, while staying within a given budget for the cost of the cuts. Approach1. Identify Valid Cut Positions: Traverse the sequence to find positions where the cumulative count of even and odd numbers up to that position is equal. These positions are valid cut points.2. Calculate Costs: For each valid cut position, compute the cost as the absolute difference between the elements adjacent to the cut.3. Optimize Cuts: Use a greedy approach to maximize the number of cuts by selecting the cuts with the lowest costs first, ensuring the total cost does not exceed the budget.

Identify Valid Cut Positions: As we iterate through the sequence, we maintain cumulative counts of even and odd numbers. Each time these counts are equal, we mark the position as a valid cut.2. Calculate Costs: For each valid cut position, compute the cost using the absolute difference between the elements adjacent to the cut.3. Optimize Cuts: By sorting the valid cuts by their costs in ascending order, we can select the maximum number of cuts starting from the cheapest, ensuring the total cost remains within the budget. This greedy approach ensures we maximize the number of cuts efficiently.This approach efficiently identifies the optimal cuts using a combination of cumulative counting and greedy selection, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c068b9fe data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review" data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review-title" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>❓:</span>You are given a tree *T* consisting of *n* vertices.

Let&#39;s read through it carefully. The problem is about a tree where each vertex has a number, and we need to calculate the sum of I(x, y) for all pairs of vertices x and y, where I(x,y) is the difference between the maximum and minimum values on the path between x and y. Oh right, the sum is over all ordered pairs, right? Wait, the sample input shows that for 4 vertices, the sum is 6. Let&#39;s check the sample to understand better.The sample input is a tree where the root (vertex 1) is connected to 2, 3, 4. The values are 2, 2, 3, 1. So for all pairs (x,y), the path between them will have certain max and min. For example, the path from 2 to 3 is through 1, so the max is 3, min 2. So difference is 1. But how many pairs contribute each difference?Wait, but the sum in the sample is 6. Let me see. Let&#39;s think of all possible pairs (since it&#39;s unordered pairs? Or ordered? The problem says &quot;all pairs of vertices x and y&quot;, so ordered pairs. Wait, no, the problem statement says &quot;the sum over all pairs x, y&quot;, but in mathematics, sometimes that&#39;s all unordered pairs. But the sample output suggests that. Let&#39;s see the sample:The vertices are 4. The total number of ordered pairs is 4*4=16. But the sum is 6. Hmm. So maybe the problem counts all ordered pairs (x,y) where x &lt;= y? Or perhaps it&#39;s considering unordered pairs, meaning each pair (x,y) is counted once, not both (x,y) and (y,x). Wait, the sample input sum is 6. Let&#39;s compute the possible I(x,y) for the sample.For all pairs (x,y), compute the max minus min on their path.The vertices are connected as 1 connected to 2,3,4. So the tree is like a star.Let&#39;s list all possible pairs (there are 4*3/2 =6 unordered pairs plus the 4 same pairs (x,x) which contribute 0. But sample output is 6, so perhaps the sum includes all ordered pairs, including (x,x), but since those contribute zero, maybe the sample output is 6 even with those included. Let&#39;s see.Sample output is 6. So the sum must be adding up all possible ordered pairs (including x=y), but the ones where x=y contribute 0, so they don&#39;t affect the sum. Let&#39;s check:In the sample:The values are a1=2, a2=2, a3=3, a4=1.Let&#39;s compute for all ordered pairs (x,y):For (1,1): path is just 1. Max and min are 2. So 0.For (1,2): path is 1-2. Values 2,2. Difference 0.(1,3): path 1-3: values 2,3. Difference 1.(1,4): 2,1. Difference 1.(2,1): same as (1,2) → 0.(2,2): 0.(2,3): path is 2-1-3. Values 2,2,3 → max 3, min 2 → difference 1.(2,4): path 2-1-4. Values 2,2,1 → max 2, min 1 → difference 1.(3,1): same as (1,3) → 1.(3,2): same as (2,3) → 1.(3,3): 0.(3,4): path 3-1-4. Values 3,2,1 → max 3, min 1 → difference 2.(4,1): same as (1,4) →1.(4,2): same as (2,4) →1.(4,3): same as (3,4) →2.(4,4):0.Now sum all these differences:Let&#39;s list all ordered pairs (16 total):0 (1,1), 0 (1,2), 1 (1,3), 1 (1,4)0 (2,1), 0 (2,2), 1 (2,3), 1 (2,4)1 (3,1), 1 (3,2), 0 (3,3), 2 (3,4)1 (4,1), 1 (4,2), 2 (4,3), 0 (4,4)Adding all the non-zero contributions:1 (1,3) +1 (1,4) +1 (2,3) +1 (2,4) +1 (3,1) +1 (3,2) +2 (3,4) +1 (4,1) +1 (4,2) +2 (4,3)Wait, let&#39;s count each of them:Looking at the list:1 (1,3)1 (1,4)1 (2,3)1 (2,4)1 (3,1)1 (3,2)2 (3,4)1 (4,1)1 (4,2)2 (4,3)So sum: 1+1 +1+1 +1+1 +2 +1+1 +2 = Let&#39;s compute step by step:1+1=2+1+1=4+1+1=6+2=8+1+1=10+2=12?Wait that&#39;s 12. But sample output is 6. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. So either my analysis is wrong, or the problem counts unordered pairs, not ordered. Because the sample output is 6. So perhaps the sum is over all unordered pairs (x,y) where x ≤ y. Let&#39;s re-calculate that.In that case, the pairs (x,y) where x ≤ y are 4 (same nodes) and the 6 unordered pairs:(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4).Now for each:(1,1): 0(1,2): 0(1,3):1(1,4):1(2,2):0(2,3):1(2,4):1(3,3):0(3,4):2(4,4):0Summing these: 1+1+1+1+2 =6. Which matches the sample. So the problem is asking for the sum over all unordered pairs (x,y) where x ≤ y. So the total pairs are n*(n+1)/2, including same nodes. So same nodes contribute 0, so sum is sum over x&lt;=y of (max - min on path x to y).Now the problem is, given a tree, compute this sum.The constraints are up to 1e6 nodes, which means that O(n^2) algorithms are impossible. So we need a smart way to compute the sum without enumerating all pairs.The key insight here is that the sum of (max - min) over all paths can be computed as the sum of max over all paths minus the sum of min over all paths. So sum_total = sum_max - sum_min. So if we can compute the sum of the maximums for all paths and the sum of the minimums for all paths, subtracting the two gives the answer.So the problem reduces to two separate problems: compute sum of maximums over all paths, compute sum of minimums over all paths, then subtract.So now the problem is to compute these two sums. Let&#39;s focus on sum_max first.How to compute the sum of maximums over all paths in a tree?This is a classic problem. The standard approach is to use a monotonic stack or union-find data structure to compute for each element the number of subarrays (or paths) where it is the maximum. But in a tree, paths are more complex than in arrays. So perhaps we can find a way to count for each node, the number of paths where it is the maximum. Then multiply by the value of the node and sum all contributions. Similarly for the min.But how to compute for each node, how many paths have their maximum as a_i.Similarly, for the min: count the number of paths where a_i is the minimum, then sum a_i multiplied by that count.So sum_max is the sum over all a_i * (number of paths where a_i is the maximum).Similarly sum_min is sum over a_i * (number of paths where a_i is the minimum).So how to compute for each a_i, the number of paths where it is the maximum.In a tree, each path is between two nodes. So for a given node u with value a_i, we need to find the number of pairs (x,y) such that u is on the path between x and y, and a_i is the maximum value on that path.So for each node u, the number of pairs (x,y) where u is the maximum in their path.To compute this, we can use a technique similar to the one used in finding the number of subarrays where a[i] is the maximum. For arrays, we find the next greater element to the left and right. For trees, perhaps we can decompose the tree into components where nodes are connected with values less than a_i, and then compute the number of nodes in each component.Alternatively, here&#39;s a possible approach:Sort all nodes in decreasing order of a_i. For each node u, when processing it, we can consider that it&#39;s the maximum in any path that includes u and only nodes from the processed set (since we process in decreasing order). So we can use a DSU (disjoint set union) structure where each time we process a node, we connect it to its adjacent nodes that have already been processed (since their a_j is larger than a_i, so u is larger than them). Wait, no. Wait, we process in decreasing order. So the first node processed has the highest a_i. For each node u, when we process it, any adjacent nodes already processed (and thus have a_i &gt;= u&#39;s a) can&#39;t have u as the maximum in their paths. So perhaps the approach is to for each node u, find the number of pairs (x,y) where the maximum on the path x to y is exactly a_i. To do this, when processing nodes in decreasing order, for u, we can find the size of the connected components adjacent to u that have been processed (since those nodes have higher or equal a_i, but since we process in decreasing order, the already processed nodes have higher or equal a_i). Wait, perhaps the idea is:When processing u (in order of decreasing a_i), the current connected components consist of nodes with a_i &gt;= u&#39;s a. So any path that includes u and any nodes in its connected components can&#39;t have u as the maximum, since there&#39;s a node with higher a. Therefore, the paths where u is the maximum are those paths that lie entirely within the component formed by u and the neighboring components (which are processed after u, but this is getting a bit confusing).Alternatively, here&#39;s a method inspired by Krusky&#39;s algorithm:We can model the problem as building the maximum spanning tree and for each node u, the number of pairs in its component when it is the maximum. Let&#39;s think:We process nodes in decreasing order of a_i. For each node u, we look at its adjacent edges and connect to nodes that have been processed (i.e., those with a_i &gt;= a_u). Wait, but edges in the original tree are fixed. So when processing u, the adjacent nodes that have already been processed form connected components. So u can connect to those components, but in the original tree structure. So for the current u, the set of nodes that are connected to u and have a_i &gt;= a_u are those in the adjacent components (processed). But since the original tree is a tree, any path through u can only go through the edges in the original tree.So here&#39;s a possible approach:We want to find, for each u, the number of pairs of nodes (x, y) such that the path x-y includes u, and a_u is the maximum on the path.To find this, when u is processed (in decreasing order of a_i), we can consider the connected components formed by the nodes with a_i &gt; a_u that are adjacent to u in the original tree. Because any path that includes u and any of these nodes cannot have u as the maximum. So the valid pairs (x, y) must lie in the subtrees of u that are connected through nodes with a_i &lt;= a_u.Wait, perhaps the correct way is to think that u is the maximum in the path x-y if and only if x and y are in different &quot;clusters&quot; formed by nodes with a_i &gt; a_u. So when u is the maximum, x and y must be in different clusters that are connected through u. Because if any node in the path x-y has a higher a_i than u, then u can&#39;t be the maximum. So for u to be the maximum in x-y&#39;s path, the path must not contain any nodes with a higher a_i than u. But u is part of the path, so the maximum is u. So all the nodes on the path x-y must have a_i &lt;= a_u, and at least one of them is u. So the path x-y must pass through u, and all nodes in the path must have a_i &lt;= a_u. So x and y must be in the same connected component of the tree when considering only nodes with a_i &lt;= a_u, and their path must include u.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of an example.Suppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4, and the values are 3, 2, 4, 1. So when sorted in decreasing order: 4 (node 3), 3 (node1), 2 (node2), 1 (node4).Processing node3 (a=4) first. All paths passing through node3, and all nodes in those paths have a_i &lt;=4. Since 4 is the maximum, any path that includes node3 and any other nodes (since all others have a_i &lt;=4) would have node3 as the maximum. But wait, no. For example, path node1 to node3 would have maximum 3 and 4, so the maximum is 4 (node3). So the number of pairs where node3 is the maximum is the number of pairs (x,y) where x is in the component including nodes with a_i &lt;=4 (which is all nodes except none, since node3 is the first processed). Wait, maybe the way to compute it is:When processing node u (in decreasing order of a_i), the existing components are those that are connected via nodes with a_i &gt;= a_u. So when u is processed, any path that is entirely within the components connected to u (but with nodes that have a_i &gt;= a_u) would have their maximum as a higher a_i. So for u to be the maximum, the paths must be entirely in the part of the tree where all nodes are &lt;= a_u, and the path must include u. But how to model that.Alternatively, here&#39;s a method inspired by the approach used in the problem of finding for each element the number of subarrays where it&#39;s the maximum:For each node u, the number of paths where u is the maximum is equal to the product of the sizes of the &quot;blocks&quot; connected through u where all nodes in the blocks have a_i &lt; a_u, multiplied by 2 (since the path can go either way?), but this might not be the case in a tree.Wait, in an array, the number of subarrays where a[i] is the maximum is left * right, where left is the number of consecutive elements to the left of i that are less than a[i], and right is the same to the right. But in a tree, it&#39;s more complicated.Alternatively, for each node u, we can find all the regions of the tree where the nodes have a_i &lt; a_u, and then the number of pairs (x, y) where the path x-y includes u and all nodes in the path have a_i &lt;= a_u. But how?Let me think of the tree structure. The maximum in the path x-y is u if and only if:1. u is on the path between x and y.2. All nodes on the path have a_i &lt;= a_u.So, to find for each u, the number of pairs (x,y) where these two conditions hold.So the approach is to compute for each u, the number of pairs (x,y) that lie in the subtree (or subgraph) consisting of nodes with a_i &lt;= a_u, and such that u is on the path between x and y.But how to compute this?An alternative approach is:For each node u, find all nodes that can reach u without passing through any node with a_i &gt; a_u. Then, the count for u is the number of pairs (x, y) where x and y are in different branches (relative to u) in this subgraph.This is similar to the problem of finding the number of pairs (x,y) in a tree such that the path x-y passes through u. The standard solution for that is to compute the sizes of the subtrees connected to u, and sum the product of the sizes of each pair of subtrees.So, for each u, if the tree is split into k subtrees when u is removed (each connected component after removing u is a subtree), then the number of pairs passing through u is the sum_{i &lt; j} s_i * s_j, where s_i is the size of the i-th subtree. This is because any pair (x,y) where x is in subtree i and y is in subtree j (i != j) must pass through u.So applying this to our problem: for each u, the subgraph where all nodes have a_i &lt;= a_u. Then, within this subgraph, the number of pairs (x,y) where the path passes through u is the sum over all pairs of subtree sizes after removing u from this subgraph. Each such pair contributes to the count of u being the maximum.But how do we compute this subgraph for each u?This seems computationally challenging for large n (up to 1e6). But perhaps we can process the nodes in order of increasing a_i and use a DSU structure. Here&#39;s a possible plan:Sort all nodes in increasing order of a_i. For each node u in this order, we can consider that any node processed before u has a_i &lt;= a_u. When processing u, we need to connect it to adjacent nodes that have already been processed (since their a_i &lt;= a_u). Then, for each u, the size of its connected component before processing u would be the number of nodes that can be connected to u with a_i &lt;= a_u. But this doesn&#39;t directly give us the subtree information needed for the pairs passing through u.Alternatively, when processing nodes in increasing order, for each u, all adjacent nodes that have a_i &lt;= a_u are already processed. So when u is processed, we can merge it with those adjacent nodes. Then, the connected component of u (after processing) includes all nodes that are connected to u and have a_i &lt;= a_u. But how does this help in computing the number of pairs where u is the maximum?Wait, perhaps when we process u (in increasing order), all nodes in its connected component (after processing u) have a_i &lt;= a_u. So the maximum among all nodes in the connected component is a_u. So the pairs (x,y) within this connected component where the path x-y includes u and u is the maximum in their path.But this approach might not capture all cases. Let&#39;s think: for any pair (x,y) in the connected component of u after processing, the maximum on their path is the maximum a_i in that path. Since all nodes in the path are in the connected component (which has a_i &lt;= a_u), the maximum is either a_u or another node with a_i = a_u. But if a_u is the maximum in the connected component, then all pairs (x,y) in the component have their maximum &lt;= a_u. But how do we count the pairs where the maximum is exactly a_u?Alternatively, the pairs (x,y) where the maximum in their path is a_u are those pairs where the path x-y includes u and there are no nodes in the path with a_i &gt; a_u. But since u is processed in increasing order, when the connected components are merged, all nodes in the component have a_i &lt;= a_u. So any path in this component can have a maximum up to a_u.Wait, perhaps the sum of the maximums can be computed by considering each node u and the number of pairs (x,y) where u is the maximum in their path, which is the number of pairs (x,y) in the connected component formed by u and all nodes with a_i &lt;= a_u, and the path x-y includes u. Then, this would contribute a_u multiplied by the number of such pairs.But how to compute this.Let me try to model this.For sum_max:We process the nodes in increasing order of a_i. For each u, when we process it, we merge it with its adjacent nodes that have already been processed (since those have a_i &lt;= a_u). For each such merge, we can track the size of the connected component. However, the key is to compute the number of new pairs added to the sum_max when processing u.Wait, here&#39;s an alternative approach inspired by the inclusion-exclusion principle. For each node u, the number of pairs (x,y) where the maximum on the path is exactly a_u is equal to the total number of pairs in the component containing u (after considering all nodes with a_i &lt;= a_u) minus the total number of pairs in the components that were merged when adding u.But I&#39;m not sure. Let&#39;s think through an example.Suppose we have a simple tree with nodes connected as 1-2-3. The a values are 1, 3, 2. So sorted order by a_i is 1 (a=1), 3 (a=2), 2 (a=3).Processing node 1 first (a=1). Its component is size 1. No pairs. Sum remains 0.Processing node3 (a=2). Its adjacent nodes are 2, which hasn&#39;t been processed yet (a=3 &gt;2). So no merging. Component size 1. Sum remains 0.Processing node2 (a=3). Adjacent nodes are 1 and 3. Both have been processed. So we merge node2 into components of 1 and 3. The new component size is 1+1 +1 =3. The total pairs in the new component is 3*(3-1)/2 =3. Before merging, the component of 1 had 1, component of 3 had 1. So the existing pairs were 0 + 0. The new pairs added are 3*(3-1)/2 - (1*0 + 1*0) )=3. These new pairs are all pairs that include node2. But node2&#39;s a is 3, which is the maximum. So these pairs contribute 3*3=9 to sum_max. But how does this fit into the algorithm?Alternatively, when processing node2 (highest a_i), all pairs in the component formed by merging 1,2,3 will have their maximum as 3 (since node2&#39;s a_i is 3, which is higher than 1 and 2). So the number of such pairs is 3 choose 2 =3, each contributes 3. So sum_max +=3*3=9.So for this example, sum_max is 9, sum_min would be calculated similarly, and the answer is sum_max - sum_min.But how to model this.So the approach is:- Sort the nodes in increasing order of a_i.- For each node u in this order, when processing u, we merge it with adjacent nodes that have already been processed (since their a_i &lt;= a_u). The DSU helps track the connected components.- The number of new pairs added when processing u is the size of the new component (after merging) multiplied by (size-1)/2, minus the sum of the previous sizes&#39; pairs.But how to compute the number of pairs where the maximum is exactly a_u.Ah, here&#39;s the key: when processing u in increasing order, all nodes in the component that u is part of after processing have a_i &lt;= a_u. Therefore, any pair in this component must have a maximum that is &lt;= a_u. So the maximum could be a_u or some node with a_i =a_u processed after u. Wait, but since we are processing in increasing order, nodes with a_i =a_u would be processed after u only if they have higher indices. So this complicates things.Alternatively, if we process nodes in increasing order, then when processing u, all nodes in the connected components merged into u&#39;s component have a_i &lt;= a_u. So the maximum in any pair in this component is &lt;= a_u. But how to count the pairs where the maximum is exactly a_u.This seems tricky. So perhaps the correct way is to process the nodes in increasing order and for each u, when merging its adjacent components, compute the number of new pairs that have their maximum as a_u. Because when u is processed, all nodes in the merged components have a_i &lt;= a_u. So any pair that includes u and at least one node from each of the merged components will have their maximum as a_u. Wait, no. For example, if a previous component has a node v with a_v = a_u, then pairs within that component could have maximum a_v (equal to a_u). But since the problem requires that the maximum is exactly a_u, those pairs would count towards the sum.So perhaps, when processing u, the number of pairs added where the maximum is a_u is equal to the number of pairs that are formed by connecting the previously separate components (those that are merged into u&#39;s component) through u. Because those pairs (x,y) where x is in one component and y is in another component must pass through u, and since all nodes in those components have a_i &lt;= a_u, the maximum is a_u.So the idea is that when processing u, the number of pairs (x,y) that are formed by connecting k components (through u) is the sum over the product of the sizes of each pair of components. For example, if merging two components of sizes s1 and s2, the number of new pairs is s1 * s2. Then, each such pair (x,y) will have their path go through u, and since all nodes in the components have a_i &lt;= a_u, the maximum is a_u.Yes, this makes sense. So for each u, when merging the adjacent components (those that have a_i &lt;= a_u), the number of new pairs that have their maximum as a_u is the sum of the product of the sizes of each pair of components that are being merged via u. For example, if u is connected to three components of sizes s1, s2, s3, then the number of new pairs is s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3. This is equivalent to (s1 + s2 + s3)^2 - (s1^2 + s2^2 + s3^2)) / 2. But since the initial sum is s1*s2 + s1*s3 + s2*s3, which can be computed as the product of the sum of the components sizes squared minus the sum of squares, divided by 2.So for each u, when processing it, the number of new pairs added where the maximum is a_u is the sum of the product of the sizes of all pairs of adjacent components (including the node u itself, which has size 1). Then, multiply this by a_u and add to sum_max.Similarly, for sum_min, we process nodes in decreasing order and compute the same thing, but subtract from sum_min.Wait, no. For sum_min, we need to find the number of pairs (x,y) where the minimum is a_u. This would require processing nodes in decreasing order, and merging components where adjacent nodes have a_i &gt;= a_u. Then, when merging, the new pairs formed are those where the path x-y passes through u, and all nodes in the path have a_i &gt;= a_u, so the minimum is a_u.So the approach for sum_max and sum_min is similar, but with opposite sorting orders.So the algorithm steps are:1. Compute sum_max:   a. Sort all nodes in increasing order of a_i.   b. Initialize a DSU structure where each node is in its own component. Also, track the size of each component.   c. For each node u in the sorted order:      i. Find all adjacent nodes in the original tree that have already been processed (i.e., their a_i &lt;= a_u).      ii. For these adjacent nodes, collect the sizes of their components.      iii. The current component for u is 1 (since it&#39;s being processed now).      iv. Compute the sum of the products of the sizes of all pairs of the components (including u&#39;s component). For example, if the adjacent nodes have components of sizes s1, s2, ..., sk, then the total new pairs is (sum s_i) * (sum s_j) - sum s_i^2 ) / 2 + sum s_i * 1. Wait, because u&#39;s own component is size 1, and we need to consider pairs between u&#39;s component and all others, and pairs among the others.      Alternatively, suppose we have k components with sizes s_0 (the component of u, which is 1) and s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (the components of the adjacent processed nodes). The total new pairs is the sum over i &lt; j of s_i * s_j.      So the initial sum is 0. For each component merged with u&#39;s component, we accumulate the product of the current total size with the new component&#39;s size.      So the way to compute this is:      total = 0      sum_s = 0      for each component s in the adjacent processed components:          total += sum_s * s          sum_s += s      then, u&#39;s component (size 1) is added to sum_s, so total += sum_s * 1      So the total new pairs is sum_s_prev * 1 + total_prev, but I&#39;m not sure.      Wait, let&#39;s think with an example.      Suppose u has adjacent components of sizes 2 and 3. So when merging u (size 1), the new components are 2,3,1.      The new pairs are:      2*3 (pairs between the two adjacent components)      2*1 (pairs between 2 and u&#39;s component)      3*1 (pairs between 3 and u&#39;s component)      So total new pairs is 2*3 + 2*1 + 3*1 =6 +2 +3=11.      But the way to compute this is sum_{i &lt; j} s_i s_j where s_i are 2,3,1.      Which is (2+3+1)^2 - (2² +3² +1²) ) / 2 = (36 - (4+9+1))/2 = (36-14)/2=22/2=11.      So the formula is (sum_s)^2 - sum_squares) / 2.      So in this case, sum_s =6, sum_squares=14, (36-14)/2=11.      So, for each u, when merging the adjacent components (s_1, s_2, ..., s_k) and the u&#39;s component (size 1), the total new pairs is ( (sum_components + 1)^2 - (sum_components_squares + 1) ) / 2.      But how to compute this efficiently.      Let&#39;s think of the algorithm:      For each u, when processing:         - collect all adjacent components (already processed) and their sizes.         - sum the sizes of these components into a variable sum_adjacent.         - sum the squares of these sizes into sum_squares_adjacent.         - the u&#39;s component is size 1.         - sum_total = sum_adjacent + 1.         - sum_squares_total = sum_squares_adjacent + 1.         - the number of new pairs is (sum_total^2 - sum_squares_total) // 2.         - subtract the pairs that existed before merging the adjacent components. Wait, no. Because before merging, the adjacent components are separate. The pairs that existed in those components are not new. So the new pairs are the cross pairs between the components and between the components and u.         So when processing u, the new pairs is the sum of all possible pairs between the components (including u&#39;s component) that were not possible before.         So for example, if there are two adjacent components with sizes s1 and s2, and u&#39;s component is 1, then the new pairs are s1*s2 (pairs between the two components), s1*1 (pairs between component1 and u), s2*1 (pairs between component2 and u).         Which is exactly the sum over all pairs between the new components. So the formula is (sum_total)^2 - sum_squares_total) / 2.         So the steps are:         For each u:             adjacent_components = [s for s in sizes of adjacent processed nodes&#39; components]             sum_adjacent = sum(adjacent_components)             sum_squares_adjacent = sum(s*s for s in adjacent_components)             total_sum = sum_adjacent + 1             total_squares = sum_squares_adjacent + 1             new_pairs = (total_sum * total_sum - total_squares) // 2             sum_max += new_pairs * a_u             Then, merge all these components and u into a single component with size total_sum.So this seems manageable.Now, how to implement this using DSU.Each time we process a node u, we need to find all its adjacent nodes in the original tree that have already been processed (i.e., their a_i &lt;= a_u). For each such adjacent node v, we find the root of its component. We collect all unique roots (to avoid duplicates), and then compute the sum of their sizes and sum of squares.So the steps for sum_max:Initialize DSU, each node&#39;s parent is itself, size is 1.Sort all nodes in increasing order of a_i.sum_max =0for u in sorted order:    processed_adjacent_components = set()    for v in adjacent[u]:        if v has been processed (a_v &lt;= a_u):            root = find(v)            if root not in processed_adjacent_components:                processed_adjacent_components.add(root)    # Now collect the sizes of these components    sum_adjacent =0    sum_squares_adjacent =0    for root in processed_adjacent_components:        s = size[root]        sum_adjacent += s        sum_squares_adjacent += s*s    total_sum = sum_adjacent + 1 # adding u&#39;s component (size 1)    total_squares = sum_squares_adjacent + 1*1    new_pairs = (total_sum * total_sum - total_squares) // 2    sum_max += a_u * new_pairs    # Merge all the adjacent components and u into one component    # To do this, we can merge all roots with u.    # So first, create a new component for u (if not already merged)    # Then, merge all adjacent components into u&#39;s component.    # The order of merging doesn&#39;t matter for DSU with union by size.    # So for each root in processed_adjacent_components:    for root in processed_adjacent_components:        union(u, root)So after merging, the size of u&#39;s component will be sum_adjacent +1.Wait, but initially, u&#39;s component is size 1. When merging with adjacent components, each merge operation will combine the components, and the size accumulates.So yes, after all merges, the size of the component is sum_adjacent +1.But the DSU needs to track the size of each component. So when we process u, we first check the adjacent nodes that have been processed (a_v &lt;=a_u). For each, we find their root. We collect all unique roots. Then, we compute sum_adjacent and sum_squares_adjacent. Then, we compute new_pairs and add to sum_max.Then, for each of these roots, we merge them with u. So after this, u&#39;s component will have the combined size.But the order in which we merge is important. For example, when merging multiple components into u&#39;s component, each union operation will link them. But the DSU&#39;s union by size or rank ensures that this is efficient.So the key steps are:- Process nodes in increasing order for sum_max.- For each node u, collect the sizes of adjacent components that have been processed.- Calculate the new_pairs as (sum_adjacent +1)^2 - (sum_squares_adjacent +1) // 2.- Add new_pairs * a_u to sum_max.- Merge all these components into u&#39;s component.Similarly, for sum_min, we process nodes in decreasing order of a_i. For each node u, the adjacent nodes that have already been processed (a_v &gt;=a_u) are considered. The same steps as above are followed, but using a different DSU structure. Then, the sum_min is computed as the sum of new_pairs * a_u.Once we have sum_max and sum_min, the answer is sum_max - sum_min.Now, the challenge is to implement this efficiently for n up to 1e6.Potential issues:- Sorting 1e6 nodes is manageable.- For each node, iterating through all its adjacent nodes. Since it&#39;s a tree, each node has O(1) edges on average. So total edges processed are O(n) for sum_max and O(n) for sum_min.- DSU operations: Each union and find is O(alpha(n)) time. For each node in sum_max processing, the number of unions is equal to the number of adjacent processed components, which is O(1) on average, since each edge is processed twice (once for each node). So total DSU operations are O(n) for sum_max and O(n) for sum_min. So overall, the algorithm is O(n alpha(n)) time, which is acceptable for 1e6 nodes.Now, let&#39;s test this approach with the sample input.Sample Input:42 2 3 1Edges:1-21-31-4So nodes are 1 (a=2), 2 (a=2), 3 (a=3), 4 (a=1).Processing for sum_max:Sort nodes in increasing order of a_i.The order would be:4 (a=1), 1 (a=2), 2 (a=2), 3 (a=3).sum_max is 0.Processing node4 (a=1):Adjacent nodes are 1 (a=2, which hasn&#39;t been processed yet). So no adjacent processed components. So sum_adjacent=0, sum_squares_adjacent=0.total_sum=0 +1=1.total_squares=0 +1=1.new_pairs = (1^2 -1)/2 = 0.sum_max +=1 *0=0.No merging. So node4&#39;s component is size 1.Processing node1 (a=2):Adjacent nodes are 2 (a=2, not processed yet), 3 (a=3, not processed yet), 4 (a=1, processed).Adjacent processed nodes: only node4.sum_adjacent = size of node4&#39;s component (1). sum_squares_adjacent=1.total_sum=1+1=2.total_squares=1+1=2.new_pairs=(2^2 -2)/2 = (4-2)/2=1.sum_max +=2 *1=2.Then, merge node1 and node4&#39;s components. New size is 2.Processing node2 (a=2):Adjacent nodes are 1 (a=2, which has been processed (node1 is processed in order after node4, but node1 was processed before node2? Because the processing order is sorted by a_i. So node1&#39;s a_i is 2, same as node2. So the sorted order depends on how the nodes are ordered when a_i is equal. For example, the sorted list for sum_max is nodes sorted by increasing a_i. So nodes with a_i=2 are 4 (a=1), then node1 and node2 (a=2), then node3 (a=3). So processing order for a_i=2 is node1 first, then node2.So when processing node2, the adjacent nodes are 1 (processed already), 3 (a=3, not processed), and others.So node2&#39;s adjacent processed nodes are node1.sum_adjacent is the size of node1&#39;s component (which is 2). sum_squares_adjacent is 2²=4.total_sum=2 +1=3.total_squares=4 +1=5.new_pairs=(9 -5)/2 =4/2=2.sum_max +=2 *2=4. sum_max is now 2+4=6.Merge node2&#39;s component (size1) with node1&#39;s component (size2). New size is 3.Processing node3 (a=3):Adjacent nodes are 1 (processed), and others. So node1 is processed (a=2 &lt;3).sum_adjacent is size of node1&#39;s component (3). sum_squares_adjacent=3²=9.total_sum=3+1=4.total_squares=9 +1=10.new_pairs=(16-10)/2=6/2=3.sum_max +=3 *3=9. sum_max is 6+9=15.Merge node3&#39;s component (size1) with node1&#39;s component (size3). New size is4.So sum_max is 15.Now for sum_min:Processing nodes in decreasing order of a_i.Order: node3 (a=3), node1 (a=2), node2 (a=2), node4 (a=1).sum_min is 0.Processing node3 (a=3):Adjacent nodes are 1 (a=2 &lt;3 → not processed yet). So no processed adjacent nodes.sum_adjacent=0.total_sum=0 +1=1.sum_squares=0 +1=1.new_pairs=(1-1)/2=0. sum_min +=3 *0=0.No merging.Processing node1 (a=2):Adjacent nodes are 2 (a=2),3 (a=3),4 (a=1).Adjacent processed nodes are node3 (processed already? Because node3 was processed first, and a_i=3 &gt;=2. Yes.Wait, for sum_min, we process nodes in decreasing order. So sorted order for sum_min is node3 (3), node1 (2), node2 (2), node4 (1).So when processing node1 (a=2), adjacent nodes are 3 (processed), 2 (not processed yet), 4 (not processed yet).So only node3 is processed.sum_adjacent = size of node3&#39;s component (1). sum_squares_adjacent=1.total_sum=1+1=2.total_squares=1+1=2.new_pairs=(4-2)/2=1. sum_min +=2 *1=2.Merge node1 and node3&#39;s components. Size 2.Processing node2 (a=2):Adjacent nodes are 1 (processed, since node1 has a=2 &lt;= node2&#39;s a=2). So node1 is processed.sum_adjacent = size of node1&#39;s component (2). sum_squares_adjacent=4.total_sum=2+1=3.total_squares=4+1=5.new_pairs=(9-5)/2=2. sum_min +=2 *2=4. sum_min now 2+4=6.Merge node2 and node1&#39;s components. New size 3.Processing node4 (a=1):Adjacent nodes are 1 (processed, a=2 &gt;=1). So node1&#39;s component is size3.sum_adjacent=3. sum_squares_adjacent=9.total_sum=3+1=4.total_squares=9+1=10.new_pairs=(16-10)/2=3. sum_min +=1 *3=3. sum_min now 6+3=9.Merge node4&#39;s component with node1&#39;s component. Size4.So sum_min is 9.Answer is sum_max (15) - sum_min (9) =6, which matches the sample. So the algorithm works.Now, the code.We need to:1. Read the input: n, a list, then edges.2. Build adjacency list.3. Compute sum_max and sum_min as described.Implementing the DSU with path compression and union by size.For sum_max:Sort the nodes in increasing order of a_i, and process them in that order.For each node u in this order:- Check all adjacent nodes v. If v has been processed (i.e., a_v &lt;= a_u), then collect their roots.- Compute sum_adjacent and sum_squares_adjacent.- Compute new_pairs.- Add a_u * new_pairs to sum_max.- Merge u with all these roots.Similarly for sum_min:Sort nodes in decreasing order of a_i, process them in that order.Again, check adjacent nodes v that have been processed (a_v &gt;= a_u).Now, the code.But for the DSU, since we process sum_max and sum_min separately, we need two different DSU structures.Implementing this for large n (1e6) requires efficient code.But how to handle the two passes (sum_max and sum_min) with separate DSU.So code outline:n = int(input())a = list(map(int, input().split()))edges = [[] for _ in range(n)]for _ in range(n-1):    u, v = map(int, input().split())    u -=1    v -=1    edges[u].append(v)    edges[v].append(u)Then, compute sum_max:sorted_max = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: a[x])parent_max = list(range(n))size_max = [1]*nprocessed_max = [False]*nsum_max =0for u in sorted_max:    processed_max[u] = True    roots = set()    for v in edges[u]:        if processed_max[v]:            # find root            root = find_max(v)            roots.add(root)    sum_adj =0    sum_sq =0    for root in roots:        sum_adj += size_max[root]        sum_sq += size_max[root] 2    total = sum_adj +1    total_sq = sum_sq +1    new_pairs = (total * total - total_sq) //2    sum_max += a[u] * new_pairs    # merge    for root in roots:        union_max(u, root)Similarly for sum_min:sorted_min = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: -a[x])parent_min = list(range(n))size_min = [1]*nprocessed_min = [False]*nsum_min =0for u in sorted_min:    processed_min[u] = True    roots = set()    for v in edges[u]:        if processed_min[v]:            root = find_min(v)            roots.add(root)    sum_adj =0    sum_sq =0    for root in roots:        sum_adj += size_min[root]        sum_sq += size_min[root] 2    total = sum_adj +1    total_sq = sum_sq +1    new_pairs = (total * total - total_sq) //2    sum_min += a[u] * new_pairs    for root in roots:        union_min(u, root)ans = sum_max - sum_minprint(ans)But implementing the DSU functions for both sum_max and sum_min.Implement the DSU with path compression and union by size.Implement find and union for both cases.So code for find_max:def find_max(u):    while parent_max[u] != u:        parent_max[u] = parent_max[parent_max[u]]        u = parent_max[u]    return udef union_max(u, v):    u_root = find_max(u)    v_root = find_max(v)    if u_root == v_root:        return    if size_max[u_root] &lt; size_max[v_root]:        u_root, v_root = v_root, u_root    parent_max[v_root] = u_root    size_max[u_root] += size_max[v_root]Similarly for find_min and union_min.But in Python, writing functions like this for large n (1e6) is possible, but the code must be optimized.But since we can&#39;t define functions inside the code due to performance (but for code submission, it&#39;s possible), we&#39;ll implement the DSU with path compression and union by size.But in Python, for efficiency, it&#39;s better to implement the DSU with lists.So here&#39;s the full code:Read the input.Build the adjacency list.Process for sum_max:Sort the nodes by increasing a.Initialize DSU variables.Process each node, collect the adjacent processed components.Compute sum_adj and sum_sq.Compute new_pairs.Add to sum_max.Merge.Same for sum_min.But in Python, for n=1e6, this code may be too slow. But perhaps with proper optimizations, like using path compression and union by size, it can pass.Now, let&#39;s test the sample.Sample input:42 2 3 1edges:1-2 → 0-11-3 →0-21-4 →0-3sorted_max is [3,0,1,2] (a[3]=1, a[0]=2, a[1]=2, a[2]=3).Processing node3 (index 3, a=1):Adjacent nodes are 0. Not processed (processed_max[0] is False). So roots is empty.sum_adj=0, sum_sq=0.new_pairs= (0+1)^2 - (0+1) // 2 = (1-1)/2=0. sum_max remains 0.Then, processed_max[3] = True.Next node0 (a=2):Adjacent nodes: 1,2,3.Processed nodes are 3 (processed_max[3] is True).find_max(3) returns 3 (parent_max[3] =3).sum_adj=1, sum_sq=1.total_sum=1+1=2.total_sq=1+1=2.new_pairs (4-2)/2=1. sum_max += 2*1=2.Merge 0 and 3. Now, parent_max[3] =0, size_max[0] =2.Processing node1 (a=2):Adjacent nodes are 0 (processed).find_max(0) returns 0.sum_adj=2, sum_sq=4.total_sum=2+1=3.total_sq=4+1=5.new_pairs (9-5)/2=2. sum_max +=2*2=4 → sum_max=6.Merge 1 and 0. Now, parent_max[0]=0, parent_max[1]=0. size_max[0] =3.Processing node2 (a=3):Adjacent nodes are 0 (processed).find_max(0) returns 0.sum_adj=3, sum_sq=9.total_sum=3+1=4.total_sq=9+1=10.new_pairs (16-10)/2=3. sum_max +=3*3=9 → sum_max=15.Merge 2 and 0. Now, size_max[0] =4.sum_max is 15.sum_min processing:sorted_min is [2,0,1,3] (a[2]=3, a[0]=2, a[1]=2, a[3]=1).Processing node2 (a=3):Adjacent nodes are 0. Not processed. sum_adj=0.new_pairs 0. sum_min +=3*0=0.processed_min[2] =True.Processing node0 (a=2):Adjacent nodes are 2 (processed).find_min(2) returns 2.sum_adj=1, sum_sq=1.total_sum=2. sum_sq=2.new_pairs (4-2)/2=1. sum_min +=2*1=2.Merge 0 and 2. size_min[0] =2.Processing node1 (a=2):Adjacent nodes are 0 (processed).find_min(0) returns 0.sum_adj=2. sum_sq=4.total_sum=3. sum_sq=5.new_pairs (9-5)/2=2. sum_min +=2*2=4 → sum_min=6.Merge 1 and 0. size_min[0] =3.Processing node3 (a=1):Adjacent nodes are 0 (processed).sum_adj=3. sum_sq=9.total_sum=4. sum_sq=10.new_pairs (16-10)/2=3. sum_min +=1*3=3 → sum_min=9.sum_max - sum_min =15-9=6.Which matches the sample.So the code works.Now, let&#39;s write the code in Python.But note that for n=1e6, using recursion for DSU is impossible. So we&#39;ll use iterative find.The code:Read n, a list.Build adjacency list.Implement DSU for sum_max and sum_min.Now, the code:import sysdef main():    import sys    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 &lt;&lt; 25)    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]    for _ in range(n-1):        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())        u -=1        v -=1        adj[u].append(v)        adj[v].append(u)    # Compute sum_max    sorted_max = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: a[x])    parent_max = list(range(n))    size_max = [1] * n    processed_max = [False] * n    sum_max =0    for u in sorted_max:        processed_max[u] = True        roots = set()        for v in adj[u]:            if processed_max[v]:                # find root                p = v                while parent_max[p] != p:                    parent_max[p] = parent_max[parent_max[p]]                    p = parent_max[p]                roots.add(p)        sum_adj =0        sum_sq =0        for root in roots:            sum_adj += size_max[root]            sum_sq += size_max[root] 2        total = sum_adj +1        total_sq = sum_sq +1        new_pairs = (total * total - total_sq) //2        sum_max += a[u] * new_pairs        # merge u with all roots        for root in roots:            if root == u:                continue            # make sure u is the root after merging            # Union by size            # Find roots again (in case previous unions have changed)            # But since we&#39;re processing in sorted order, and each root is processed once.            # So after find, we can proceed.            # Find root of u (which is u itself, as processed_max[u] is True, but not merged yet.            root_u = u            if size_max[root_u] &lt; size_max[root]:                root, root_u = root_u, root            parent_max[root] = root_u            size_max[root_u] += size_max[root]    # Compute sum_min    sorted_min = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: -a[x])    parent_min = list(range(n))    size_min = [1] * n    processed_min = [False] * n    sum_min =0    for u in sorted_min:        processed_min[u] = True        roots = set()        for v in adj[u]:            if processed_min[v]:                # find root                p = v                while parent_min[p] != p:                    parent_min[p] = parent_min[parent_min[p]]                    p = parent_min[p]                roots.add(p)        sum_adj =0        sum_sq =0        for root in roots:            sum_adj += size_min[root]            sum_sq += size_min[root] 2        total = sum_adj +1        total_sq = sum_sq +1        new_pairs = (total * total - total_sq) //2        sum_min += a[u] * new_pairs        # merge        for root in roots:            if root == u:                continue            root_u = u            if size_min[root_u] &lt; size_min[root]:                root, root_u = root_u, root            parent_min[root] = root_u            size_min[root_u] += size_min[root]    print(sum_max - sum_min)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()This code should handle the problem. However, in Python, for n=1e6, this may be too slow. But given the problem constraints, this is the correct approach.Potential optimizations:- Precompute the sorted order for sum_max and sum_min.- In the DSU find, use iterative path compression.Which is already implemented in the code.But for very large n, this code might TLE. However, in practice, for programming competition settings, this is the standard approach and should work.Now, let&#39;s test this code with the sample input.Sample Input:42 2 3 11 21 31 4The code should output 6.Yes.So the code should work.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of differences between the maximum and minimum values on all simple paths in a tree. Given the constraints, an efficient approach is necessary to avoid an O(n^2) solution. Approach1. Problem Analysis: The key insight is to split the problem into two parts: summing the maximum values over all paths and summing the minimum values over all paths. The result is the difference between these two sums.2. Algorithm Selection: Use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) with path compression and union by size to efficiently manage merging components while processing nodes in sorted order.3. Sorting and Processing: Process nodes in increasing order for maximum values and decreasing order for minimum values. For each node, calculate the contribution of new paths formed by merging adjacent components.4. Complexity: The algorithm runs in O(n log n) time due to sorting and DSU operations, which is efficient for large inputs up to 1e6 nodes.

Reading Input: The input is read and stored in an adjacency list to represent the tree.2. Sorting Nodes: Nodes are sorted by their values in increasing order for computing maximum values and in decreasing order for minimum values.3. DSU Operations: For each node, adjacent components that have already been processed are merged. The size of these components is used to compute the number of new paths where the current node is the maximum or minimum.4. Path Contribution Calculation: For each node, the contribution of new paths formed by merging components is calculated and added to the respective sum (sum_max or sum_min).5. Result Calculation: The final result is the difference between the sum of maximum values and the sum of minimum values over all paths.This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures optimal performance for large inputs.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>🔑:</span></p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c068b9fe data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review" data-v-2d73fe7f><div class="review-title" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>❓:</span>A long time ago (probably even in the first book), Nicholas Flamel, a great alchemist and the creator of the Philosopher&#39;s Stone, taught Harry Potter three useful spells. The first one allows you to convert *a* grams of sand into *b* grams of lead, the second one allows you to convert *c* grams of lead into *d* grams of gold and third one allows you to convert *e* grams of gold into *f* grams of sand. When Harry told his friends about these spells, Ron Weasley was amazed. After all, if they succeed in turning sand into lead, lead into gold, and then turning part of the gold into sand again and so on, then it will be possible to start with a small amount of sand and get huge amounts of gold! Even an infinite amount of gold! Hermione Granger, by contrast, was skeptical about that idea. She argues that according to the law of conservation of matter getting an infinite amount of matter, even using magic, is impossible. On the contrary, the amount of matter may even decrease during transformation, being converted to magical energy. Though Hermione&#39;s theory seems convincing, Ron won&#39;t believe her. As far as Ron is concerned, Hermione made up her law of conservation of matter to stop Harry and Ron wasting their time with this nonsense, and to make them go and do homework instead. That&#39;s why Ron has already collected a certain amount of sand for the experiments. A quarrel between the friends seems unavoidable...Help Harry to determine which one of his friends is right, and avoid the quarrel after all. To do this you have to figure out whether it is possible to get the amount of gold greater than any preassigned number from some finite amount of sand.The first line contains 6 integers *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, *f* (0&lt;=≤&lt;=*a*,&lt;=*b*,&lt;=*c*,&lt;=*d*,&lt;=*e*,&lt;=*f*&lt;=≤&lt;=1000).Print &quot;Ron&quot;, if it is possible to get an infinitely large amount of gold having a certain finite amount of sand (and not having any gold and lead at all), i.e., Ron is right.

So, the goal is to determine if it&#39;s possible to get an infinite amount of gold starting from a finite amount of sand. If that&#39;s possible, we print &quot;Ron&quot;; otherwise, &quot;Hermione&quot;. Hmm, the problem revolves around three transformations. Let&#39;s think about how these transformations can loop to create more and more gold each time. Let me restate the problem. We have three spells:1. Convert a grams of sand to b grams of lead.2. Convert c grams of lead to d grams of gold.3. Convert e grams of gold to f grams of sand.The key here is to find a cycle where, after performing these transformations in some order, we end up with more sand than we started with, which could then be used to generate even more gold. Wait, but how does that lead to infinite gold? Because if each cycle produces a net gain in sand, you can repeat the process, each time accumulating more sand which can be converted into more gold. Alternatively, perhaps the cycle directly produces more gold each time without needing to loop through sand again. But the spells require certain amounts to be used. So maybe we need to check if there&#39;s a way to have a multiplicative effect greater than 1 when going through the cycle.Let&#39;s model this. Suppose we start with some sand. Let&#39;s see what happens when we apply the spells in a loop. For example, the cycle could be sand → lead → gold → sand. Let&#39;s track the conversions:Start with S sand. Spell 1: a sand → b lead. So, to convert all sand to lead, you need S &gt;= a. But maybe you can do it in batches. Wait, no. Each spell converts a fixed amount. So, for example, if you have S sand, you can only convert a grams each time, producing b lead each time. So perhaps the process is that each cycle uses a certain amount of sand, then produces lead, then converts that lead into gold, then uses some gold to get sand again, and see if the total sand produced from the gold is more than the initial sand used. Then this would allow you to have a surplus, leading to infinite sand and hence infinite gold.Alternatively, perhaps the key is to model the conversion rates. Let&#39;s think in terms of ratios. For example, the first spell converts a sand to b lead. So the ratio is b/a per sand. But maybe that&#39;s not directly applicable. Let&#39;s think in terms of cycles.The loop would be sand → lead → gold → sand. Each full cycle starts with some sand, converts part of it to lead, then lead to gold, then gold back to sand. The question is whether each cycle produces more sand than it started with. If so, then each iteration can create more and more sand, leading to infinite resources. Then, using that sand, you can keep converting to lead and then to gold, leading to infinite gold.But how to model this? Let&#39;s consider the net gain in sand after one full cycle. Suppose we start with X grams of sand. Let&#39;s see:1. Convert a sand to get b lead. So, we use a sand, get b lead. The remaining sand is X - a. But wait, but the spell requires exactly a grams of sand to perform. So, if X &lt; a, you can&#39;t perform the first spell. So for the cycle to be possible, we need to have enough sand. But if after conversion, the remaining sand plus the new sand from gold conversion is enough to perform the cycle again, then it&#39;s possible to loop.Alternatively, maybe the cycle is that after converting a sand to lead, then c lead to d gold, then e gold to f sand, the total sand obtained is f, which is compared to a. If f &gt; a, then each cycle gives a surplus of (f - a) sand, which allows the process to repeat, each time increasing the sand. Then, you can use the ever-increasing sand to generate more and more gold. So the key condition would be whether f &gt; a. But that&#39;s probably not the whole story because the intermediate steps have required amounts.Wait, let&#39;s think: To do the cycle once, you need to have at least a sand. Then convert a sand to b lead. Then, you need to have at least c lead to convert to d gold. Then, you need at least e gold to convert to f sand. So the cycle can be done only if:a sand → b lead (after spell 1)c lead → d gold (after spell 2)e gold → f sand (after spell 3)But if the amount of lead after spell 1 is less than c, then spell 2 can&#39;t be applied. Similarly, if the gold after spell 2 is less than e, spell 3 can&#39;t be applied.So, the cycle can only be performed if:After spell 1: b &gt;= c (so that spell 2 can be applied)After spell 2: d &gt;= e (so that spell 3 can be applied)Then, after spell 3, the sand is f. Then, the net sand after the entire cycle is (original sand - a) + f. So, if (f - a) &gt; 0, then each cycle would generate (f -a) sand, which can be used to repeat the cycle again. However, this depends on the initial sand being sufficient.Wait, but the initial sand is X. After converting a sand to lead, we have X - a sand left. Then, after converting c lead to d gold, we have b - c lead left. Then, after converting e gold to f sand, we have d - e gold left. Then, the total sand is (X -a) + f. If (X -a) + f &gt;= X, then X -a + f &gt;= X → f -a &gt;=0 → f &gt;=a. But if f &gt;=a, then each cycle would leave the sand at (X -a) +f = X + (f -a). So if f &gt;a, then each cycle gives X + (f -a) sand. Then, the next cycle can be performed again as long as X + (f -a) &gt;=a. But if f -a is positive, then over multiple cycles, the sand increases, allowing for infinite iterations, leading to infinite sand. Then, using that sand, you can convert as much as possible into lead, then into gold, leading to infinite gold.So, the key condition is whether this cycle can be completed once and whether f &gt;a. But there are several preconditions for the cycle to be possible.So the cycle (sand → lead → gold → sand) is possible only if:1. a &gt;=1 (since you need to convert a grams of sand. Wait, no, the input can have a=0. But if a is zero, then converting sand to lead gives you something for nothing. So we have to be careful with all the possible edge cases.But let&#39;s think about all the steps required to perform the cycle once. For the cycle to be possible, you need:- a sand is converted to lead. So, the initial amount of sand must be &gt;=a. Then, after conversion, you have X -a sand + b lead.Then, to convert lead to gold, you need at least c lead. So b must be &gt;=c. Otherwise, even after converting a sand, you can&#39;t perform the next step.Then, after converting c lead to d gold, you have (b -c) lead and d gold.Then, to convert e gold into f sand, you need d &gt;=e. If d &lt;e, then you can&#39;t perform the third spell. So, after spell 2, you have d gold. So, spell 3 requires e gold. So d &gt;=e must hold.If all these conditions are met, then after the cycle, you get f sand from the third spell. Then, the sand after the cycle is (X -a) + f.So, for the cycle to generate a surplus, we need f &gt;a.If all these conditions are true (a &lt;= X, but X can be as large as needed), then each cycle increases the sand by (f -a) grams. So, after each cycle, the sand grows. Thus, you can keep doing this cycle, generating more and more sand. Then, you can use that sand to convert into lead and then into gold, leading to infinite gold.So, the overall condition is:If (b &gt;= c) and (d &gt;=e) and (f &gt;a), then Ron is correct.But wait, what about when a=0? Because if a=0, then you can get infinite lead from zero sand. For example, if a=0, then spell 1 converts 0 sand to b grams of lead. So, you can get infinite lead by converting zero sand. Then, convert that lead to gold. So even if a=0, if spell1 gives you some lead, then the rest of the steps can be done.So, perhaps the conditions are more complex. Let&#39;s consider all possible scenarios where the cycle can be done, leading to an increasing amount of sand.Let me think again. The process to get more sand via the cycle requires:1. You can perform spell1, spell2, spell3 in sequence. For that, the following must be possible:- spell1 can be used (have enough sand). But if a=0, then you can use spell1 regardless of the sand you have. Because converting 0 sand requires no sand, and gives you b lead. So even with zero sand, you can use spell1 (since a=0, you can perform the conversion once, producing b lead).But the initial scenario is that we start with some finite amount of sand, no lead, no gold. So, for the first cycle:We start with S sand, 0 lead, 0 gold.To perform spell1: need a sand. If S &gt;=a, then after spell1, we have S -a sand, and b lead.But if a=0, then even with S=0 sand, we can perform spell1, getting b lead. So, if a=0, then the first step is possible even with no sand.So, the first step is possible if either a=0 (regardless of S), or S &gt;=a.But how much sand do we start with? The problem states that we start with a finite amount of sand. So, to perform the cycle once, perhaps the initial sand must be &gt;=a (if a&gt;0). But once we can perform the cycle once, we can generate more sand, which allows us to do more cycles.But if a=0, then even with zero sand, you can perform the cycle. So, in that case, the cycle can be done any number of times.So, let&#39;s outline the necessary and sufficient conditions for the cycle to be possible and to generate surplus sand.Case 1: a=0.In this case, spell1 can be used even without any sand. So, using spell1 gives us b lead. Then, check if spell2 can be used (c &lt;=b). Then, spell2 gives d gold. Then, check if spell3 can be used (e &lt;=d). Then, spell3 gives f sand. Then, the sand after the cycle is f (since initial sand was 0, and after a=0 conversion, sand remains 0, then adding f gives f).If after this cycle, f &gt;0 (since a=0), then each cycle produces f sand. So if f &gt;0, then each cycle adds f sand. But since a=0, each cycle can be done again, generating more sand. But wait, in the next cycle, the sand is f. So, spell1 uses a=0 sand (so no sand is consumed), and gives b lead. Then, lead is converted again. So each cycle would generate f sand. But how does this multiply? Wait, each cycle gives f sand. So, after each cycle, you have f sand. But since a=0, you can do the cycle again, generating f more sand each time. But then the total sand would be S = initial sand (0) + f * k, where k is the number of cycles. So each cycle adds f sand. But if f is positive, then the sand can be made arbitrarily large. Then, using that sand, you can convert into lead and then into gold. Wait, but how?Alternatively, after accumulating a lot of sand, you can perform the spells in a way to generate gold. Let&#39;s see.But perhaps the key is that after each cycle, you get some sand, which can be used to do more conversions. But if the cycle can be repeated infinitely, generating more sand each time, then you can have infinite sand, which can be converted into lead, then into gold. So the total gold would be (d/c) * (lead amount) each time. So, if the sand is infinite, then the lead can be infinite, then gold can be infinite.But let&#39;s get back to the conditions for the cycle. So, for a=0:If after spell1 (b lead), spell2 requires c &lt;=b. Then spell2 gives d gold. Then spell3 requires e &lt;=d. Then spell3 gives f sand. Then, if f &gt;0, then each cycle gives f sand, and since a=0, each cycle can be done again. So after each cycle, sand increases by f. So, if f &gt;0, then after k cycles, you have k*f sand. Which can be made arbitrarily large. Then, you can use that sand to convert into lead. But spell1 converts a=0 sand to b lead. So, regardless of how much sand you have, converting a=0 sand gives you b lead each time, without using any sand. So, you can generate infinite lead, then infinite gold via spell2. So in that case, even if the cycle&#39;s sand is not increasing (as f could be 0), but if a=0 and you can generate lead, then you can get infinite gold.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s take a sample input where a=0.For example, sample input 6: 1 0 1 2 1 2. The output is Hermione. Let&#39;s see why.Wait, let&#39;s look at the sample inputs and outputs to get some clues.Sample input 6 is &quot;1 0 1 2 1 2&quot;. Output is Hermione.But in this case, a=1, b=0. So spell1 converts 1 sand to 0 lead. That&#39;s a bad conversion. So, using spell1 would lose sand and get nothing. So that&#39;s not helpful. Then, the cycle may not be possible. So the output is Hermione.Another sample input: 100 1 100 1 0 1. Output is Ron. Let&#39;s see.In this case, a=100, b=1. Then, spell1 converts 100 sand to 1 lead. Then spell2: c=100, so you need 100 lead to convert to 1 gold. But after spell1, you have 1 lead, which is less than 100. So spell2 can&#39;t be done. So the cycle can&#39;t be done. But the sample output is Ron, which suggests that there&#39;s another way.Wait, perhaps I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the spells can be used in any order, not necessarily in the cycle. So, maybe we can find any sequence of spells that allows us to generate more and more gold. So the three spells can be used in any order, not just the sand→lead→gold→sand cycle.Wait, the problem says: &quot;whether it is possible to get the amount of gold greater than any preassigned number from some finite amount of sand&quot;. So, given any large number M, can we eventually get more than M gold, starting with some finite amount of sand and zero lead and gold.So, the approach is to find if there&#39;s a way to create a loop that, when repeated, increases the total amount of gold each time, or allows the creation of more sand, which can then be converted into gold.So, perhaps the key is to see if there&#39;s a way to have a positive net gain in either sand, lead, or gold through a cycle of spells.Alternatively, perhaps the problem reduces to checking if there&#39;s a cycle where converting the resources in a certain way leads to a multiplicative gain in the amount of gold.Let me think of the process as a graph where nodes are the amounts of sand, lead, gold. Edges are the spells. We need to find a cycle that allows us to generate more resources each time.But this might get complicated. Let&#39;s consider the different possibilities.First, let&#39;s think about the process of converting sand to lead to gold. Then, using gold to get sand again. If each loop of this cycle produces more sand than it started with, then you can keep looping and generate infinite sand, which can be converted into infinite gold.Alternatively, maybe you can generate more gold directly without needing to loop through sand. For example, if the conversion from lead to gold (spell2) gives a net gain, and you have a way to generate lead from sand (spell1), then perhaps you can generate infinite gold by repeatedly using spell1 and spell2. But spell1 requires sand each time. So you need to have a way to generate sand to keep converting into lead.But this depends on the sand supply. So, if spell3 (gold to sand) gives more sand than needed for spell1, then it&#39;s possible to loop.So, the possible scenarios where infinite gold is possible:Case 1: The cycle sand → lead → gold → sand produces a net gain in sand. This allows the sand to be used again to generate more lead and gold. Each cycle increases the sand, leading to more resources each time. The condition here is that after completing the cycle, the total sand is higher than before. So, in this case, the cycle&#39;s net sand gain is (f - a). But for the cycle to be possible, the intermediate steps must have enough resources (lead and gold) to perform the spells.Case 2: There&#39;s a way to generate lead and gold infinitely without needing to loop through sand. For example, if spell3 is not needed. For instance, if spell1 and spell2 alone can generate more gold each time. But spell1 requires sand, which is finite. Unless you can generate sand via spell3. So, maybe this is covered in Case 1.Other cases could involve converting lead to gold and then gold to lead again, but that&#39;s probably not applicable here.So, the core idea is that the cycle (sand → lead → gold → sand) must be possible and have a net gain in sand, which allows the process to repeat and accumulate sand. Once sand can be accumulated infinitely, converting it into lead and then into gold would allow infinite gold.So, the steps for the cycle:1. Use a sand to make b lead. (requires a &lt;= sand)2. Use c lead to make d gold. (requires c &lt;= lead)3. Use e gold to make f sand. (requires e &lt;= gold)After this cycle, the net sand is (original sand - a) + f. The net gain is (f - a). For this to be positive, f must be &gt; a. But also, the cycle must be possible.But even if (f -a) is positive, the cycle can only be performed if the intermediate steps have enough resources. So, for the first cycle to be possible:- a &lt;= initial sand (or a=0, which allows spell1 to be done even with no sand)- After spell1, the lead is b. So, c &lt;= b (to perform spell2)- After spell2, the gold is d. So, e &lt;=d (to perform spell3)- After spell3, the sand is (original sand -a) +f. For the cycle to be repeatable, this must be &gt;= a (if a&gt;0). But if (f -a) is positive, then after each cycle, the sand increases. So once the first cycle is done, the sand becomes S1 = (S0 -a) + f. If f&gt; a, then S1 = S0 + (f -a). So as long as S0 &gt;=a (to start the first cycle), then S1 &gt;= (a -a) +f = f. If f&gt; a, then S1 is S0 + (f-a). So after the first cycle, the sand is S0 + (f -a) -a +f? Wait, no. Wait, initial sand is S0.After spell1: sand is S0 -a, lead is b.After spell2: lead is b -c, gold is d.After spell3: gold is d -e, sand is (S0 -a) +f.So, after the first cycle, the sand is S0 -a +f. For the next cycle, if a&gt;0, then we need (S0 -a +f) &gt;=a → S0 + (f -2a) &gt;=0. But if f&gt; a, then over time, the sand increases. So after a few cycles, the sand will be enough to perform the cycle again.But for the first cycle to be possible, the initial sand must be &gt;=a (if a&gt;0). If a=0, then no sand is required, and the cycle can be done even with 0 sand.So, the overall conditions are:If the cycle is possible (i.e., after spell1, spell2, spell3 can be performed in sequence) and the net gain (f -a) is positive, then Ron is right. But how do we check if the cycle can be performed.So, the cycle can be performed if:1. Either a=0 (so spell1 can be done without sand) OR there&#39;s enough initial sand (S &gt;=a).But the initial sand is finite. However, once the first cycle is done, the sand becomes S -a +f. So, as long as S &gt;=a and f &gt;a, then after the first cycle, the sand is S -a +f. Since f&gt; a, this is S + (f -a) &gt;=a → since S &gt;=a, then S + (f -a) &gt;=a + (f -a) =f. But f may be larger than a. So, if f &gt;a, then S1 = S -a +f = (S -a) +f. If f &gt;a, then S1 = (S -a) +f = S + (f -a). So after each cycle, the sand increases by (f -a). So, after the first cycle, the sand is sufficient for the next cycle as long as (S + (f -a)) &gt;=a. Which is true because f&gt; a → (f -a) &gt;0. So, once the first cycle is possible, subsequent cycles are possible.But how to get the first cycle done. The initial sand S must be &gt;=a (if a&gt;0) OR a=0.But the problem states that we start with some finite amount of sand. So, the question is whether there exists a finite initial sand S such that after applying the cycle once (if possible), the sand increases. Then, the process can be repeated, leading to infinite sand.So, the conditions for Ron are:There exists a way to perform a cycle that generates more sand than it consumes. And that cycle can be repeated indefinitely.So, the necessary conditions are:1. The cycle (spell1 → spell2 → spell3) can be done, given the initial S (which is finite). So, after spell1, spell2 and spell3 can be done.   To perform the cycle once, the following must hold:   a. If a &gt;0: S &gt;=a. Then, after spell1, we have S -a sand, b lead.   b. spell2 requires c &lt;= b lead. So, b &gt;=c.   c. After spell2, we have d gold. spell3 requires e &lt;=d. So, d &gt;=e.   So, the conditions for the cycle to be possible are: (a=0 OR (a&gt;0 and S &gt;=a)) AND b &gt;=c AND d &gt;=e.   But S is given as a finite amount. However, the problem allows us to choose S. So, we can choose S &gt;=a (if a&gt;0). So, the cycle can be possible if:   (a=0 OR (a&gt;0 and exists S &gt;=a)) → which is always true for a&gt;0, as S can be chosen as a.   So, the conditions for the cycle to be possible (regardless of S) are:   (b &gt;=c) AND (d &gt;=e).   Because if a&gt;0, we can choose S=a. Then, after spell1, lead is b, which must be &gt;=c. Then, spell2 gives d gold, which must be &gt;=e. Then, spell3 can be performed.   So, the cycle is possible if:   (b &gt;=c) AND (d &gt;=e) AND (a=0 OR a&gt;0 with S &gt;=a).   But S can be chosen as a (if a&gt;0). So, the conditions are (b &gt;=c) AND (d &gt;=e).   Now, after the cycle, the sand is (S -a) +f. If S =a (for a&gt;0), then after the cycle, sand is 0 +f =f. So, for the cycle to generate a net gain, f &gt;a.   Because (S -a) +f = a -a +f = f. So, if f &gt;a, then the sand after the cycle is f &gt;a. Then, next cycle can be done with f sand (since f &gt;=a, if a&gt;0, but if f &lt;a, then next cycle can&#39;t be done. Wait, but if f&gt; a, then next cycle&#39;s sand is f &gt;=a, so next cycle can be done. Then after that, the sand becomes (f -a) +f = 2f -a. But if f&gt; a, this is more than f. So, each cycle increases the sand by (f -a). Thus, the sand grows without bound, allowing infinite cycles. Then, after each cycle, the sand increases, which can be converted into more lead and gold.   So, in this case, the conditions for Ron are:   (b &gt;=c) AND (d &gt;=e) AND (f &gt;a).   Additionally, when a=0, the cycle can be done even with zero sand. So, if a=0, then the cycle is possible if (b &gt;=c) and (d &gt;=e), and then f must be positive (since a=0, f&gt;0).   Wait, because when a=0, the net gain is f -0 =f. So, if f&gt;0, each cycle adds f sand. So, after each cycle, sand increases by f. So, even if a=0 and f&gt;0, the cycle can be done infinitely, leading to infinite sand.   But what if a=0, b &gt;=c, d &gt;=e, but f=0? Then, each cycle gives f=0 sand. So after the cycle, sand is (0 -0) +0 =0. Then, the next cycle can be done again (since a=0). But each time, the sand remains zero, but the lead and gold may accumulate. Wait, no. Because after the first cycle:   sand is 0 → spell1 (a=0) gives b lead. Then spell2 (c lead to d gold). So, after spell2, lead is b -c. Then spell3 (e gold to f=0 sand). So, after spell3, gold is d -e. So, the sand remains 0. So, each cycle doesn&#39;t generate any sand. So, even though you can perform the cycle, the sand doesn&#39;t increase, so you can&#39;t get more sand. But maybe you can use the lead and gold generated to create more gold.   But in this scenario, after spell1, you have b lead. Spell2 converts c of it to d gold. So, remaining lead is b -c. Then spell3 converts e gold to 0 sand. So, remaining gold is d -e. But after that, you have b -c lead and d -e gold.   So, in the next cycle, you start with 0 sand again. So, you can repeat the same steps. But each cycle adds lead and gold only if the conversions generate more. But if, for example, spell1 produces more lead than consumed by spell2 (b &gt;c), then after each cycle, the lead increases by (b -c). Similarly for gold.   So, perhaps another scenario where infinite gold is possible is if there&#39;s a way to generate infinite lead or gold without needing sand. For example, if spell1 and spell2 can be used in a way that produces more lead or gold each cycle.   Let&#39;s think: if spell1 can be done with a=0 (convert 0 sand to b lead), and b&gt;0. Then, each time you do spell1, you get b lead. So, if you can do spell1 infinitely, you can get infinite lead. Then, convert that into gold via spell2. But spell2 requires c lead. So, if you can collect enough lead via spell1, then you can convert it into gold. For example, if a=0, and spell1 gives b=5 lead each time. Then, after two spell1 uses, you have 10 lead. Then, spell2 converts c=10 to d= something. If d&gt;0, then you can get some gold. But this depends on the values.   So, another case to consider: when a=0 and b&gt;0. Then, spell1 can be used any number of times. Each use gives b lead. So, after k uses, you have k*b lead. Then, spell2 can be used when you have c lead. So, after k*b &gt;=c, you can use spell2 to get d gold. Then, spell3 requires e gold. So, if d &gt;=e, you can use spell3 to get f sand. But if a=0 and f&gt;0, then each time you do spell3, you get f sand, which can be used to generate more lead and gold. But this depends on multiple steps.   But in this case, the process would be: use spell1 multiple times to generate enough lead for spell2. Then, spell2 to get gold. Then, spell3 to get sand. Then, use sand for spell1 again (if a&gt;0). But this seems complicated.   For example, if a=0, b=100, c=50, d=200, e=100, f=50. Then:   spell1 can be used any number of times. Each time, get 100 lead. After one use, lead is 100. Then, spell2 (c=50) converts 50 lead to 200 gold. So, lead is now 50, gold is 200. Then, spell3 (e=100) converts 100 gold to 50 sand. Now, sand is 50, lead is 50, gold is 100. Then, can use spell1 again (a=0) to convert 0 sand to 100 lead. Now, lead is 50 +100=150. Then, spell2 again (50 lead → 200 gold). So, gold becomes 100+200=300. Spell3 converts 100 gold to 50 sand. Now, sand is 50+50=100. Lead is 100, gold is 200. And so on. Each cycle seems to be increasing the sand. So, perhaps in this case, it&#39;s possible to generate infinite sand and gold.   So, the conditions are not limited to the initial cycle of sand→lead→gold→sand. There may be other ways to generate infinite gold.   This complicates the problem. So, perhaps the problem requires considering all possible ways to generate infinite gold, not just the sand→lead→gold→sand cycle.   So, the problem is to determine if there&#39;s any possible way to generate infinite gold, starting with some finite sand and zero lead and gold.   Let&#39;s think of the possible ways:   1. Generate infinite sand via a cycle (like the sand→lead→gold→sand cycle with f&gt; a). Then, use that sand to generate infinite lead and gold.   2. Generate infinite lead via spell1 (if a=0 and b&gt;0), then use spell2 to convert to gold. Since spell1 can be used any number of times (since a=0), each use generates b lead. Then, if c is such that you can convert the lead to gold, you can get infinite gold.   For example, if a=0, b&gt;0, and c &lt;=b. Then, each use of spell1 followed by spell2 would convert a grams of sand (0) to b lead, then c lead to d gold. So, each time, you can generate d gold. But each spell1 gives b lead. So, you can use spell1 once, then spell2 once. The lead after spell1 is b. Spell2 requires c. So, if c &lt;=b, then spell2 converts c lead to d gold, leaving (b -c) lead. Then, you can use spell1 again (since a=0) to add b more lead, making total lead (b -c) +b = 2b -c. If this is &gt;=c, you can do spell2 again. But this depends on the values.   Alternatively, perhaps if you can get d&gt;0 from spell2, and each time you can collect enough lead to do spell2 once. For example, if a=0, b=5, c=5. Then, each spell1 gives 5 lead, which is enough to do spell2 once. Then, each time you can generate d gold. So, each cycle (spell1 + spell2) generates d gold. So, after k cycles, you have k*d gold. So, if d&gt;0, then you can generate infinite gold.   So, in this case, even without spell3, you can generate infinite gold. So, this is another condition where Ron is right.   So, this suggests that there are multiple scenarios to consider.   Let&#39;s try to model all possible scenarios where infinite gold can be generated.   Scenario 1: There&#39;s a way to generate infinite sand via a cycle. This requires:   - The cycle can be performed (b &gt;=c and d &gt;=e).   - The net sand gain is positive (f &gt;a, or a=0 and f&gt;0).   Scenario 2: There&#39;s a way to generate infinite lead and gold via spells1 and 2, without needing to generate sand. This requires:   - a=0 (so spell1 can be done with zero sand).   - spell1 produces b&gt;0 lead.   - spell2 can be done once (c &lt;=b). And, each time spell2 is done, the amount of lead produced allows subsequent uses of spell1 and spell2 to generate more gold.   For example, if spell1 produces b lead each time, and spell2 uses c lead to produce d gold, and the sum of lead after each cycle is non-decreasing, then you can generate infinite gold.   Wait, but spell2 uses c lead. So, after spell1 gives b lead, spell2 uses c of them. So, if b &gt;=c, then each cycle (spell1 + spell2) generates d gold and (b -c) lead. If (b -c) &gt;=0, then after each cycle, the remaining lead is (b -c). Then, using spell1 again adds b lead, making total lead (b -c) +b = 2b -c. If 2b -c &gt;=c, then you can do spell2 again. But this depends on the values.   Alternatively, if spell1 can be used multiple times to generate enough lead for spell2. For example, if a=0, and b=5, c=10. Then, using spell1 twice gives 10 lead, which allows spell2 to be used once. Then, spell2 converts 10 lead into d gold, leaving 0 lead. Then, use spell1 twice again. So, each 2 spell1s and 1 spell2. So, each cycle generates d gold, and requires two spell1s. So, the total gold is k*d for k cycles. But as long as d&gt;0, this can generate infinite gold.   So, for this scenario to be possible:   a=0 and (d&gt;0 and there exists a way to generate enough lead for spell2 via multiple uses of spell1, and spell2 can be done enough times to generate arbitrarily large gold).   But how to model this?   Alternatively, perhaps if spell1 can generate lead at a rate such that the total lead can be used to produce gold in a way that the amount of gold can be made arbitrarily large.   For example, if a=0 and b&gt;0, then you can generate any amount of lead by using spell1 multiple times. Each use adds b lead. Once you have enough lead (k*b) to do spell2 k times (each time using c lead), then the total gold is k*(d/c) * (k*b) ? Not sure. Wait, no. Each spell2 uses c lead to produce d gold. So, if you have L lead, you can do L//c spells2, generating (L//c)*d gold. So, if you can generate L lead, which can be arbitrarily large, then you can generate (L//c)*d gold. Which can be made arbitrarily large by increasing L. So, if a=0 and b&gt;0 and d&gt;0, then you can generate infinite gold by using spell1 to get as much lead as needed, then convert it to gold.   So, this is another scenario where Ron is correct.   So, scenario 2 is:   a=0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0.   Because, if a=0 and b&gt;0, you can generate infinite lead. Then, as long as c&gt;0 and d&gt;0, you can convert lead to gold. For example, every time you generate b lead, you can use spell2 to convert c of it to d gold. So, if b &gt;=c, then each spell1 and spell2 can be done once. Otherwise, you need to collect enough lead from multiple spell1 uses. For example, if a=0, b=3, c=5, d=1. Then, after two spell1 uses, you have 6 lead, which allows one spell2 use (5 lead →1 gold), leaving 1 lead. Then, one more spell1 gives 4 lead. Then, another spell2 use. So, over time, you can generate as much gold as needed.   So, as long as a=0, b&gt;0, c&gt;0, d&gt;0, then you can generate infinite gold.   Because even if c is larger than b, you can use spell1 multiple times to accumulate enough lead to use spell2 once. Each time you use spell2, you get d gold. So, the number of times you can use spell2 depends on how much lead you generate. But since you can generate infinite lead by using spell1 infinitely, you can use spell2 infinitely often as well, provided that you can accumulate c lead at each step.   For example, if a=0, b=1, c=100, d=1. Then, each spell1 gives 1 lead. To use spell2 once, you need 100 lead. So, after 100 spell1 uses, you can use spell2 once, getting 1 gold. Then, you need another 100 spell1 uses for another gold. So, it&#39;s possible to generate arbitrarily large gold, but it would take a lot of steps. But since the problem allows any number of steps, this is still possible.   So, in this case, the condition is:   a=0, and b&gt;0, and d&gt;0.   Because even if c=0, then spell2 requires 0 lead to produce d gold, but according to the input constraints, c and d are between 0 and 1000. If c=0, then spell2 converts 0 lead to d grams of gold. So, if a=0 and c=0 and d&gt;0, then you can generate infinite gold by repeatedly using spell2 (since it requires no lead). But spell2 can be used even with zero lead. So, you can generate d gold each time. So, this would allow infinite gold.   So, scenario 2 can be further broken down into:   a=0, and d&gt;0, and (c=0 OR (b&gt;0 and spell2 can be used at least once)).   But if c=0 and d&gt;0, then spell2 can be used any number of times (since it requires zero lead), producing d gold each time. So, this would allow infinite gold even if a=0 and c=0, as long as d&gt;0.   So, this suggests that if a=0 and d&gt;0 and (c=0 or (b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and you can use spell1 to generate lead for spell2)), then Ron is correct.   This is getting very complex. Let&#39;s try to find all the conditions that make Ron right.   So, the overall conditions for Ron being right are:   Either:   A) There exists a way to generate infinite sand via a cycle (sand → lead → gold → sand) with a net gain in sand. This requires:      1. (b &gt;= c) and (d &gt;= e) (so that the cycle can be performed)      2. (f &gt; a) (so that each cycle generates more sand than it consumes)   OR   B) There exists a way to generate infinite gold without relying on sand (i.e., via spells 1 and 2), which requires:      1. a=0 (so spell1 can be used without sand)      2. (c ==0 and d&gt;0) (spell2 converts 0 lead to d gold, and d&gt;0)      OR      2. (c&gt;0 and d&gt;0 and b&gt;0) (spell1 generates lead, which can be used in spell2 to generate gold. Since a=0, you can generate infinite lead by using spell1 infinitely, then convert it into gold via spell2.)   Additionally, in case B, if c&gt;0, then to use spell2, you need lead. But since a=0 and b&gt;0, you can generate infinite lead by using spell1 infinitely. Then, even if each spell2 requires a lot of lead, you can accumulate it over multiple spell1 uses.   So, the conditions for case B are:   a=0 and d&gt;0 and ( (c=0) or (b&gt;0) )   Because:   - If c=0, then spell2 converts 0 lead to d gold. So, even with zero lead, you can use spell2 to get d gold. So, you can generate infinite gold by using spell2 infinitely.   - If c&gt;0, then spell2 requires c lead. But if a=0 and b&gt;0, you can generate lead via spell1 (each use gives b lead). So, even if you need to use spell1 multiple times to collect enough lead for one spell2, this is possible. For example, if b=1, c=100, then each spell1 gives 1 lead. After 100 spell1 uses, you have 100 lead, which allows one spell2 use (which gives d gold). So, for each d gold, you need 100 spell1 uses. But since you can do this any number of times, you can generate as much gold as needed.   So, case B&#39;s conditions are:   a=0 and d&gt;0 and (c=0 or b&gt;0)   So, combining all possible conditions:   Ron is right if:   Either:   (A) (b &gt;=c) and (d &gt;=e) and (f &gt; a)    OR   (B) a=0 and d&gt;0 and (c=0 or b&gt;0)   OR   (C) There&#39;s another scenario where you can generate infinite gold. For example, if you can use some other combination of spells to create a cycle.   Wait, maybe there are other scenarios. For example, using spells in a different order. Like, convert lead to gold and then gold to sand, but that would require a way to get lead from sand again.   Or, perhaps, spell3 can be used to generate more gold directly. But spell3 converts gold to sand, so that&#39;s unlikely.   So, the main scenarios are A and B.   Now, let&#39;s test these conditions against the sample inputs.   Sample Input 1:   100 200 250 150 200 250   So, a=100, b=200, c=250, d=150, e=200, f=250.   Check scenario A:   b &gt;=c → 200 &gt;=250? No. So condition A not met.   Check scenario B: a=0? No. So B not met.   But sample output is Ron. Wait, this contradicts the initial analysis. So, something is wrong.   Wait, sample input 1&#39;s output is Ron. So according to the sample, it is possible to generate infinite gold. But according to the conditions we&#39;ve derived, neither A nor B apply. So, there must be another scenario.   Let me re-examine sample input 1:   a=100, b=200, c=250, d=150, e=200, f=250.   The sample output is Ron. So, how?   Let&#39;s think: perhaps the cycle is possible in some other way.   Let&#39;s calculate the conversions:   Spell1: 100 sand → 200 lead.   Spell2: 250 lead →150 gold.   Spell3: 200 gold →250 sand.   So, the cycle would require:   Spell1: sand &gt;=100.   Spell2: lead &gt;=250.   Spell3: gold &gt;=200.   But after spell1, you have 200 lead. Which is less than 250. So spell2 can&#39;t be done. So, this cycle is not possible.   So, the initial scenario A is not applicable.   So, how is the sample output Ron?   There must be another way.   Maybe the order of spells is different. For example, use spell3 first. But you start with sand, so can&#39;t use spell3.   Alternative approach: perhaps you can perform the spells in a way that allows you to generate more gold over time.   For example, start with 1000 sand.   Spell1: convert 100 sand to 200 lead. Now, sand is 900, lead is 200.   Can&#39;t use spell2 yet (need 250 lead).   So, use spell1 again: convert 100 sand to 200 lead. Now, sand is 800, lead is 400.   Now, spell2 can be used once: 250 lead →150 gold. Now, lead is 400-250=150. gold is 150.   Now, spell3 requires 200 gold. So can&#39;t use spell3 yet.   So, we have 150 gold. Need 50 more to use spell3.   But we can&#39;t do that.   Alternatively, maybe use more sand to generate more lead.   Use spell1 again: convert 100 sand to 200 lead. Now, sand is 700, lead is 150+200=350.   Use spell2: 250 lead →150 gold. Now, lead is 100, gold is 150+150=300.   Now, spell3: 200 gold →250 sand. So, convert 200 gold →250 sand. Now, gold is 100, sand is 700+250=950.   Now, sand is 950. Lead is 100.   So, after this process, sand increased from 1000 to 950 (which is a loss). But gold is now 100. So, no gain.   But the sample output is Ron. So, there&#39;s a way to generate infinite gold. So, perhaps there&#39;s a different cycle.   Or perhaps the cycle is not sand→lead→gold→sand but some other combination.   Let me think differently. Perhaps the key is that when converting sand to lead (spell1) and then lead to gold (spell2), even if you can&#39;t complete the full cycle, the amount of gold generated per sand is more than the initial sand&#39;s worth.   For example, if you can generate more gold than the sand used, and then use that gold to generate more sand again, perhaps via spell3.   But how?   Let&#39;s see: in sample input 1.   a=100, b=200, c=250, d=150, e=200, f=250.   So, each 100 sand gives 200 lead. 200 lead is not enough for spell2 (needs 250).   So, perhaps you need to use spell1 multiple times to get enough lead for spell2.   For example, start with 1000 sand.   Use spell1 twice: 200 sand → 400 lead. Now, sand is 800, lead is 400.   Use spell2 once: 250 lead →150 gold. Now, lead is 150, gold is 150.   Use spell3 once: 200 gold is needed. But we have only 150. Can&#39;t do.   Alternatively, use spell1 three times: 300 sand → 600 lead. Now, sand is 700. Lead is 600.   Spell2 twice: 250*2=500 lead → 2*150=300 gold. Lead is 100. Gold is 300.   Spell3 once: 200 gold →250 sand. Now, gold is 100, sand is 700 +250=950.   So, net sand change: 950 = 1000 - 300 (used in spell1) +250 (from spell3) → 950 = 1000-300+250= 950. So, sand is 950.    So, after this, you have 950 sand, 100 lead, 100 gold.   Now, you can use spell1 again (100 sand →200 lead). Now, sand is 850, lead is 300.   Spell2 once: 250 lead →150 gold. Lead is 50, gold is 250.   Spell3 once: 200 gold →250 sand. Now, gold is 50, sand is 850+250=1100.   So, sand increases from 950 to 1100. So, a gain of 150.   So, after each cycle of using spell1 three times, spell2 twice, spell3 once, the sand increases by 150. Then, this cycle can be repeated, leading to infinite sand. Once sand is infinite, you can convert it into lead and then into gold.   So, in this case, the cycle is not the simple sand→lead→gold→sand, but a more complex combination of spells.   So, this suggests that the initial approach (checking only the simple cycle) is insufficient. There are other ways to generate infinite gold by combining multiple uses of spells.   This makes the problem much more complicated, as we need to model all possible sequences of spells to see if any combination can generate infinite gold.   Given the time constraints, perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way to model this problem mathematically.   Let&#39;s consider the problem as a system of resource conversions and look for cycles with a positive gain.   For infinite gold to be possible, there must exist a way to perform a set of conversions that result in a net gain of gold or a resource (like sand) that can be converted into gold.   Alternatively, the problem can be modeled using graph theory, where each node represents the current amounts of sand, lead, gold, and edges represent the possible conversions. But with potentially infinite states, this is impractical.   Another approach is to model the conversions as linear equations and look for positive loops.   Let&#39;s consider each spell as a vector that transforms the resources.   Spell1: (-a, +b, 0)   Spell2: (0, -c, +d)   Spell3: (+f, 0, -e)   We need to find a combination of these vectors (multiplied by some positive integers) that results in a positive increase in gold, possibly with the ability to repeat the combination infinitely.   Additionally, since we start with only sand, we need to find a sequence of spells that can be initiated with sand and leads to a positive gain.   Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as: can we find a sequence of spells that, when applied, allows us to generate more gold than we started with, and this sequence can be repeated to accumulate more gold each time.   This is getting quite complex. Perhaps there&#39;s a mathematical way to model this.   Let&#39;s think in terms of ratios. For each spell, the conversion rate between resources.   Spell1: converts a sand to b lead. So, the rate is b/a lead per sand.   Spell2: converts c lead to d gold. Rate is d/c gold per lead.   Spell3: converts e gold to f sand. Rate is f/e sand per gold.   If we can create a cycle that starts with sand, converts to lead, then to gold, then to sand, and the product of the conversion rates is greater than 1, then each cycle multiplies the sand by that product, leading to infinite sand.   So, the product of the rates would be (b/a) * (d/c) * (f/e).    If this product is greater than 1, then each cycle multiplies the sand by (b*d*f)/(a*c*e). If this is greater than 1, then the sand grows exponentially, leading to infinite sand, which can then be converted into infinite gold.   So, the condition would be:   (b*d*f) &gt; (a*c*e)   But this is only possible if all denominators (a, c, e) are non-zero.   For example, sample input 1:   a=100, b=200, c=250, d=150, e=200, f=250.   The product is (200*150*250)/(100*250*200) = (200*150*250)/(100*250*200) = (150) / (100) = 1.5. So 1.5&gt;1. So the product is greater than 1. So, according to this condition, Ron is correct.   Sample input 1&#39;s output is Ron, which matches this condition.   Another sample input: sample input 2.   Input: 100 50 50 200 200 100.   a=100, b=50, c=50, d=200, e=200, f=100.   Product: (50*200*100)/(100*50*200) = (50*200*100)/(100*50*200) = 100 / 100 =1. So product is 1. So, no gain. So output is Hermione. Which matches sample output.   Sample input 3: 100 10 200 20 300 30.   product: (10 *20 *30)/(100*200*300) = (6000)/(6,000,000) = 0.001 &lt;1. So output is Hermione.   Sample input 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0. All zeros. product is 0. So output Hermione.   Sample input 5: 1 1 0 1 1 1.   a=1, b=1, c=0. So spell2 is converting 0 lead to 1 gold. So, spell2 can be used infinitely. So, output is Ron. According to the product, but c=0. So product is (1*1*1)/(1*0*1) → division by zero. So the product condition is not applicable. So another condition comes into play.   So, the product condition is applicable when a, c, e are all positive. Otherwise, there are other conditions to consider.   So, the product condition (b*d*f &gt; a*c*e) is one of the conditions for Ron to be right.   But there are other scenarios, like when a=0 and d&gt;0 (scenario B) or when c=0 and d&gt;0.   So, combining all possible scenarios, the complete set of conditions for Ron to be right are:   1. If the product (b*d*f) &gt; (a*c*e) and a, c, e are all positive.   2. If spell2 can generate gold for free (c=0 and d&gt;0), and a=0. Because then you can use spell2 infinitely to generate gold.   3. If a=0, b&gt;0, d&gt;0, and c&gt;0. Then, you can use spell1 to generate lead, then spell2 to generate gold. Even if the product is not greater than 1, but since you can generate lead infinitely, you can generate gold infinitely.   4. If the cycle of spells1, spell2, spell3 can be done, even if the product is not greater than 1, but other conditions allow for infinite gold. But this is unlikely.   So, the product condition captures the multiplicative gain scenario. Other conditions are captured by scenario B.   So, combining these conditions:   Ron is right if any of the following is true:   - (c ==0 and d &gt;0) and (a ==0 or we can generate sand to start the process). But if c=0 and d&gt;0, then spell2 can be used without any lead. So, even with zero lead, you can generate d gold each time. So, the only requirement is that spell2 can be used. Spell2 requires c=0 lead, which is always available. So, if c=0 and d&gt;0, then infinite gold is possible.   - (a ==0 and d &gt;0 and (c ==0 or (b &gt;0)) ). This covers scenario B.   - (b*d*f &gt; a*c*e) and a, c, e &gt;0.   So, putting this together, the code should check:   if ( (c ==0 and d &gt;0) or         (a ==0 and d &gt;0 and (c ==0 or b &gt;0)) or         (a*c*e &gt;0 and b*d*f &gt; a*c*e) ):       print(&quot;Ron&quot;)   else:       print(&quot;Hermione&quot;)   Also, need to handle the case where all parameters are zero. For example, sample input 4 gives Hermione.   Let&#39;s test this against the sample inputs.   Sample Input 1: 100 200 250 150 200 250.   c=250 !=0. a=100 !=0. e=200 !=0. product: (200*150*250) = 200*150=30000 *250=7,500,000. a*c*e=100*250*200=5,000,000. 7,500,000 &gt;5,000,000. So condition 3 holds. So output is Ron.   Sample Input 5: 1 1 0 1 1 1.   c=0, d=1&gt;0. So condition 1 holds. Output Ron.   Sample input 6: 1 0 1 2 1 2.   a=1. c=1. So condition 1 (c=0) is false. a=1 !=0, so condition 2 is false. Check condition 3: a*c*e=1*1*1=1. b*d*f=0*2*2=0. 0&gt;1 is false. So conditions not met. Output Hermione.   Sample input 7: 100 1 100 1 0 1.   a=100, c=100, e=0. So condition 3 requires a*c*e &gt;0, but e=0. So condition 3 not met. c=100 !=0. Check condition 2: a=100 !=0. No. Check condition 1: c !=0. So no. But sample output is Ron. What&#39;s wrong here.   Wait, sample input 7 is:   a=100, b=1, c=100, d=1, e=0, f=1.   So, e=0. So, spell3 converts e=0 gold to f=1 sand. So, spell3 can be used without any gold, producing 1 sand. So, using spell3 any number of times would generate 1 sand each time. So, you can generate infinite sand, then convert that into gold.   So, in this case, e=0. So, spell3 can be used with zero gold. So, each use of spell3 gives 1 sand. So, infinite sand is possible. Then, convert that into lead, then into gold.   So, this is another scenario where Ron is right.   So, the previous conditions do not cover this case. So, there&#39;s another condition: when e=0 and f&gt;0. Because spell3 can be used to generate sand from zero gold.   So, this adds another condition:   if e ==0 and f &gt;0: then you can use spell3 to generate sand. Each use of spell3 generates f sand. So, infinite sand. Then, convert to lead and gold.   So, this is scenario C:   e=0 and f&gt;0.   Because if e=0, then spell3 requires 0 gold to produce f sand. So, you can use spell3 infinitely to generate f sand each time. So, infinite sand leads to infinite gold via spells1 and 2.   So, this adds another condition:   if (e ==0 and f &gt;0 and (a &gt;0 and b &gt;0 and c &gt;0 and d &gt;0)): but perhaps not, because even if a=0, but e=0 and f&gt;0, then you can generate infinite sand via spell3, then use spell1 (if a=0) to generate infinite lead and gold.   So, the condition is:   if e ==0 and f&gt;0: then Ron is right, provided that you can generate gold from sand.   For example, if e=0 and f&gt;0, then:   - Use spell3 to generate f sand per use (since e=0).   - Then use spell1 and spell2 to convert that sand into gold.   So, even if a&gt;0, but each spell3 gives f sand, and f&gt; a, then the cycle can be done. For example:   e=0, f=5, a=3. Then, each spell3 gives 5 sand. Use 3 of them to spell1, get b lead. Convert to gold. Repeat. So, each cycle gives 5-3=2 sand. So, sand increases.   But to perform the cycle, you need to be able to convert lead to gold and then back to sand. But if e=0, then spell3 can be used any number of times.   So, scenario C is:   e=0 and f&gt;0. Because this allows infinite sand, which can be converted into gold.   So, this adds another condition.   So, the complete set of conditions for Ron is:   Ron is right if any of the following is true:   1. c ==0 and d &gt;0.   2. a ==0 and d &gt;0 and (c ==0 or b &gt;0).   3. (a, c, e &gt;0) and (b*d*f) &gt; (a*c*e).   4. e ==0 and f&gt;0 and there&#39;s a way to generate gold from sand.   But how to check condition4?   Alternatively, if e==0 and f&gt;0, then using spell3 gives f sand for free. So, you can generate infinite sand. Then, use spell1 and spell2 to convert sand into lead into gold. Even if the conversion rates are poor, as long as you can generate any gold from sand, you can generate infinite gold by using infinite sand.   For example, if e=0, f=1, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1.   Each spell3 gives 1 sand. Use spell1: 1 sand →1 lead. Spell2:1 lead →1 gold. So, each cycle gives 1 gold. So, infinite cycles can be done, leading to infinite gold.   So, in this case, e=0 and f&gt;0, and other spells are functional.   So, condition4 is: e ==0 and f&gt;0, and there exists a way to convert sand to gold (i.e., spell1 and spell2 are possible).   So, spell1 is possible when a&gt;0: you need sand &gt;=a. But if you can generate infinite sand via spell3, then you can use spell1 to convert a sand to b lead. So, if a&gt;0 and b&gt;0, then each spell3 use gives f sand, which allows spell1 to be used once per (a/f) spell3 uses. But if e=0 and f&gt;0, then spell3 can be used infinitely to generate any amount of sand.   So, condition4 is:   e ==0 and f&gt;0 and ( (a ==0 and b&gt;0) or (a&gt;0 and b&gt;0 and (c &lt;=b or spell2 can be done)) )   But this is getting too complicated.   Alternatively, condition4 can be simplified as:   e ==0 and f&gt;0 and ( (a&gt;0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) or (a==0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) )   But this may not cover all cases.   Perhaps the correct way to model this is:   If e ==0 and f&gt;0, then infinite sand can be generated via spell3. Then, to generate gold from sand, we need to check if spell1 and spell2 can be used to convert sand into gold. This requires:   a &gt;0 and b&gt;0 (so spell1 can convert sand to lead) and c &gt;0 and d&gt;0 (so spell2 can convert lead to gold).    Or, if a=0 and b&gt;0, then spell1 can generate lead from zero sand, and spell2 can convert lead to gold.   So, in this case, condition4 is:   e ==0 and f&gt;0 and ( (a&gt;0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) or (a==0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) )   So, adding this as another condition.   Now, putting all conditions together, Ron is right if any of the following is true:   1. c ==0 and d &gt;0.   2. a ==0 and d &gt;0 and (c ==0 or b&gt;0).   3. a, c, e &gt;0 and b*d*f &gt; a*c*e.   4. e ==0 and f&gt;0 and ( (a&gt;0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) or (a==0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) )   Now, sample input 7: 100 1 100 1 0 1.   e=0, f=1&gt;0. So condition4 applies. Now, check whether a&gt;0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0. a=100&gt;0, b=1&gt;0, c=100&gt;0, d=1&gt;0. So condition4 is met. So output is Ron.   Another sample input: sample input5: 1 1 0 1 1 1. Here, c=0 and d&gt;0. So condition1 is met. Output is Ron.   Another sample input where e=0: 0 0 0 0 0 0. e=0 but f=0, so no. So condition4 not met.   So, this seems to cover all cases.   Now, let&#39;s think about how to implement this in code.   The code needs to check these four conditions.   Let&#39;s outline the code steps:   Read a, b, c, d, e, f.   Check:   condition1 = (c ==0) and (d &gt;0).   condition2 = (a ==0) and (d &gt;0) and ( (c ==0) or (b&gt;0) )   condition3 = (a&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and e&gt;0) and (b*d*f &gt; a*c*e)   condition4 = (e ==0) and (f&gt;0) and (        ( (a&gt;0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) ) or        ( (a ==0) and (b&gt;0) and (c&gt;0) and (d&gt;0) ) )   if any of the conditions are true, output &quot;Ron&quot;, else &quot;Hermione&quot;.   Additionally, need to handle cases where all are zero. For example, if all parameters are zero, then output &quot;Hermione&quot;.   Let&#39;s test condition4 for sample input7:   e=0, f=1&gt;0. a=100&gt;0, b=1&gt;0, c=100&gt;0, d=1&gt;0. So, (a&gt;0 and ... ) is true. So condition4 is met.   Now, what about the case where e=0, f&gt;0, but a=0, b&gt;0, c&gt;0, d&gt;0. Then, condition4 is also met. So, for example, a=0, e=0, f=5. Then, you can use spell1 (0 sand →b lead) to generate lead, then spell2 (c lead →d gold), then spell3 (0 gold →5 sand). So, you can generate sand via spell3, then lead via spell1, then gold via spell2. But since a=0, you can generate infinite lead, then infinite gold.   So, this is covered by condition4.   Now, let&#39;s code these conditions.   But there&#39;s another edge case: when e=0, f&gt;0, but spell1 and/or spell2 cannot be used. For example, e=0, f=5, a=0, b=0. Then, spell1 cannot generate any lead. So, even though e=0, you can&#39;t convert sand to gold. So, in this case, condition4 is not met, since a=0, b=0.   So, the code needs to check if the necessary spells are available.   So, condition4 is:   e ==0 and f&gt;0 and ( (a&gt;0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) or (a==0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) )   So, in code:   condition4 = (e == 0 and f &gt; 0) and ( (a &gt;0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) or (a ==0 and b&gt;0 and c&gt;0 and d&gt;0) )   Now, let&#39;s code all the conditions.   Also, need to consider that if all parameters are zero, then condition1 to condition4 are false.   Let&#39;s test sample input4: all zeros. Output is Hermione.   Now, let&#39;s test another case:   a=0, e=0, f=5, b=5, c=5, d=5.   condition4 is met: e==0, f&gt;0, a==0, b&gt;0, c&gt;0, d&gt;0. So output is Ron.   So, this case is covered.   Now, let&#39;s code all this.   So, the code would be:   Read a, b, c, d, e, f.   condition1 = (c == 0 and d &gt; 0)   condition2 = (a == 0 and d &gt; 0 and (c == 0 or b &gt; 0))   condition3 = (a &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0 and e &gt; 0) and (b * d * f &gt; a * c * e)   condition4 = (e == 0 and f &gt; 0) and ( (a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0 and d &gt; 0) or (a == 0 and b &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0 and d &gt; 0) )   if condition1 or condition2 or condition3 or condition4:       print(&quot;Ron&quot;)   else:       print(&quot;Hermione&quot;)   Let&#39;s test this against the samples.   Sample Input 1: 100 200 250 150 200 250.   condition3: a=100&gt;0, c=250&gt;0, e=200&gt;0. b*d*f=200*150*250=7,500,000. a*c*e=100*250*200=5,000,000. 7.5m &gt;5m → true. So condition3 is true. Output Ron.   Sample Input 2: 100 50 50 200 200 100.   condition3: a&gt;0, c&gt;0, e&gt;0. product b*d*f =50*200*100=1,000,000. a*c*e=100*50*200=1,000,000. 1e6 is not greater than 1e6. So condition3 is false. Other conditions: condition1? c=50&gt;0. No. condition2? a=100 !=0. No. condition4? e=200 !=0. No. So output Hermione.   Sample Input3: 100 10 200 20 300 30.   condition3: a&gt;0, c&gt;0, e&gt;0. product:10*20*30=6000. a*c*e=100*200*300=6,000,000. 6000&lt;6e6 → false. So output Hermione.   Sample Input4: all zeros. All conditions false. Output Hermione.   Sample Input5: 1 1 0 1 1 1.   condition1: c=0 and d=1&gt;0 → true. Output Ron.   Sample Input6:1 0 1 2 1 2.   condition1: c=1 !=0. condition2: a=1 !=0. condition3: a&gt;0, c&gt;0, e&gt;0. product:0*2*2=0. 0&gt;1*1*1 → false. condition4: e=1 !=0. So output Hermione.   Sample Input7:100 1 100 1 0 1.   e=0. condition4: e==0, f=1&gt;0. a=100&gt;0, b=1&gt;0, c=100&gt;0, d=1&gt;0. So condition4 is true. Output Ron.   So, all samples pass.   Now, the code seems to handle all cases.   Now, we need to code this in Python.   Read the six integers from stdin.   Then compute the conditions.   Also, note that all parameters are allowed to be zero, but in the input constraints, they are between 0 and 1000.   Now, write the Python code.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>✅:</span>To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to generate an infinite amount of gold starting from a finite amount of sand using three specific spells. The solution involves checking several conditions to see if any combination of the spells can lead to an infinite increase in gold. ApproachThe approach involves checking four main conditions that could potentially allow infinite gold generation:1. Condition 1: If spell2 converts zero lead into a positive amount of gold, it can be used infinitely.2. Condition 2: If spell1 requires zero sand and spell2 can generate gold (either by converting zero lead or by generating enough lead through spell1).3. Condition 3: If the product of the conversion rates of the three spells (sand to lead, lead to gold, gold to sand) results in a net gain of sand.4. Condition 4: If spell3 converts zero gold into a positive amount of sand, allowing infinite sand generation, which can then be converted into gold if the other spells are functional. Solution Code```pythona, b, c, d, e, f = map(int, input().split())condition1 = (c == 0 and d &gt; 0)condition2 = (a == 0 and d &gt; 0 and (c == 0 or b &gt; 0))condition3 = (a &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0 and e &gt; 0) and (b * d * f &gt; a * c * e)condition4 = (e == 0 and f &gt; 0) and (    (a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0 and d &gt; 0) or    (a == 0 and b &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0 and d &gt; 0))if condition1 or condition2 or condition3 or condition4:    print(&quot;Ron&quot;)else:    print(&quot;Hermione&quot;)``` Explanation- Condition 1: Checks if spell2 can generate gold without requiring any lead (`c == 0` and `d &gt; 0`), which means it can be used infinitely.- Condition 2: Checks if spell1 requires no sand (`a == 0`) and spell2 can generate gold either by converting zero lead or by generating enough lead through spell1 (`b &gt; 0`).- Condition 3: Checks if the net effect of converting sand to lead, lead to gold, and gold back to sand results in a positive gain, calculated by the product of conversion rates being greater than 1.- Condition 4: Checks if spell3 can generate sand without requiring any gold (`e == 0` and `f &gt; 0`) and if there is a valid path to convert the generated sand into gold using the other spells.By systematically checking these conditions, we determine if Ron&#39;s claim of generating infinite gold is possible or if Hermione&#39;s skepticism is justified.</p><div class="divider" data-v-2d73fe7f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2d73fe7f><span class="icon" data-v-2d73fe7f>🔑:</span></p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-c068b9fe><span data-v-c068b9fe>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
