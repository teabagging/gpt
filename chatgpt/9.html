Let me try to parse it out step by step. The question is: there are 2021 points on a circle, each colored with one of the colors from 1 to k. The condition is that for every color r (from 1 to k), and for every point on the circle, there exists an arc starting at that point such that at least half of the points on that arc are colored with r. We need to find the maximum possible value of k.Hmm. So, in simpler terms, no matter which color we pick and no matter where we start on the circle, we can find some arc beginning at that point where at least half the points in the arc are of that color. The goal is to figure out the maximum number of colors k we can use while satisfying this condition.Let me rephrase the problem to make sure I get it. For each color r and each starting point, there&#39;s an arc (of some length) starting at that point where color r makes up at least half of the points on the arc. So, even if the color is used sparsely, we need that from any starting point, we can &quot;zoom in&quot; to an arc where that color is densely represented—specifically, at least 50%.The question is, what&#39;s the maximum number of colors k possible under this constraint? For 2021 points, which is an odd number. Hmm. Maybe the parity will matter here.First, let&#39;s consider some simpler cases. Maybe start with smaller numbers of points and see if we can spot a pattern or come up with a conjecture.Let&#39;s take n points. For n=3, but 2021 is a larger number. Let&#39;s see.But maybe a better approach is to think about how the colors can be arranged so that each color satisfies the given condition. Since each color must be &quot;locally dense&quot; in some arc starting at any point. That seems like a strong condition.Suppose we have a color that appears only once. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible. If a color is used only once, then for any starting point, we need an arc starting there that includes that single point and in which at least half the points are that color. Let&#39;s say the arc is of length 1. Then, the single point is the color, which is 100%, so that&#39;s fine. But wait, the problem says &quot;for all points and colors 1 ≤ r ≤ k, there exist an arc such that at least half of the points on it are colored with r.&quot; Wait, does that mean for each color r and each starting point, there&#39;s an arc starting at that point with at least half of its points colored r? Or is it that for each color r, and for every point, there&#39;s an arc starting at that point with at least half r?The problem says: &quot;For all points and colors 1 ≤ r ≤ k, there exist an arc such that at least half of the points on it are colored with r.&quot; So, for every point p and color r, there&#39;s an arc starting at p where at least half the points on that arc are color r. So, for each color r, no matter where you start on the circle, you can find an arc starting there where r is at least half.Therefore, even if a color is used only once, say at point q, then for any other starting point p, we need an arc starting at p that includes q and is such that at least half of its points are color r. But if the arc is just the single point q, then that&#39;s 1 point, 100% color r. But the problem allows the arc to be of any length, right? So, maybe the arc can be as small as 1 point? Wait, but if the arc is of length 1 (just the starting point), then if that point is color r, then it&#39;s 100%, otherwise, it&#39;s 0%. So, for a color r that is used only once at point q, then for any other starting point p, we need an arc starting at p where at least half the points are r. If p is not q, then the arc starting at p must include q and have length such that in that arc, at least half are r. Since r is only at q, the arc would need to have q as the only r, so the arc would have to be of length 1 (only q) or else include other points which are not r. So, if we take an arc starting at p, moving around the circle, when we reach q, the arc from p to q would have length equal to the number of points between p and q (inclusive). If we take the arc from p to q, the number of points is the distance from p to q plus 1. Since q is the only r in that arc, the number of r&#39;s is 1. So, to have at least half of the points be r, we need 1 ≥ (length)/2. Therefore, length ≤ 2. So, the arc can be of length 1 or 2. If the arc is of length 1, then it&#39;s just p, which is not r. If the arc is of length 2, then it includes p and the next point. If the next point is q, then we have one r in two points, which is 50%, so that&#39;s exactly half. The problem says &quot;at least half,&quot; so 50% is okay. But if the next point isn&#39;t q, then we have 0 r&#39;s. So, in order for the arc starting at p to have at least half r&#39;s, the arc must be of length 1 or 2 where one of those points is q. But if p is adjacent to q, then the arc of length 2 would include p and q. Then, one out of two is 50%, which is acceptable. But if p is not adjacent to q, then an arc of length 2 would not reach q. Therefore, in that case, the arc starting at p would have to be longer. But the longer the arc, the more non-r points it would include, so 1 r in, say, m points, which would require 1 ≥ m/2 ⇒ m ≤ 2. Therefore, for points p not adjacent to q, the only way to have an arc starting at p with at least half r&#39;s is if there&#39;s an arc of length 1 or 2 that includes q. But if p is two steps away from q, then an arc of length 3 would include p, p+1, p+2 = q. Then, 1 r in 3 points is less than half. So, that doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, if a color is used only once, it&#39;s not possible to satisfy the condition for all starting points. Because starting at a point two steps away from q, there is no arc starting at p with at least half r&#39;s. Therefore, a color used only once cannot satisfy the condition. Therefore, each color must be used at least twice? Wait, maybe.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way. Wait, but the problem states &quot;for all points and colors...&quot;, so for each color and each starting point. Therefore, even if a color is used multiple times, but if there exists some starting point where no arc starting there has at least half of that color, then it&#39;s invalid. So, each color must be arranged in such a way that from any starting point, there&#39;s some arc starting there with at least half of that color.So, perhaps each color needs to be placed in such a way that it&#39;s &quot;densely&quot; represented in some local area from any starting point. Maybe overlapping intervals?This seems related to covering the circle with arcs for each color, where each arc is such that the color is at least half in that arc, and for each color, these arcs cover the entire circle. Wait, but the condition is stronger: for each color, and each starting point, there is an arc starting at that point (i.e., beginning at that point) where the color is at least half.So, for each color, the set of arcs where the color is at least half must cover all starting points. Each arc must start at each point, but the length can vary. So, for each color, and each point, there exists an arc starting at that point with length depending on the point, such that the color is at least half in that arc.Hmm. So, for example, if a color is arranged in a block of consecutive points, then starting at the first point of the block, an arc covering the entire block would have 100% of that color. Starting just before the block, an arc that includes the entire block would have a high percentage. But starting at some point far away, you need an arc that somehow captures a part of the block. Wait, but if the color is in a block, then from a starting point opposite the block, the arc would have to go all the way around to include the block, which might be too long, leading to the color being only a small fraction.Therefore, maybe the colors need to be distributed in such a way that they are interleaved or spaced in a particular pattern so that from any starting point, you can find an arc that contains a sufficient number of that color.Alternatively, think in terms of majority. If a color has a majority in some arc, but the problem requires that for any starting point, there&#39;s an arc starting there where the color is at least half. So, perhaps each color needs to be placed such that it&#39;s &quot;locally dense&quot; in multiple regions.Alternatively, maybe the problem is related to the concept of &quot;circular chromatic number&quot; or something similar, but I might be off track here.Alternatively, consider that for each color r, the set of points colored r must be such that around the circle, they are spaced in a way that from any point, you can move forward some number of steps and encounter enough r&#39;s to make up half the arc.Suppose that each color is used m times. Then, in order for there to be an arc starting at any point with at least half of the arc&#39;s points being color r, we need that in some window starting at any point, the number of r&#39;s is at least half the window&#39;s size.This seems similar to a sliding window problem, where for each position, there exists a window starting at that position with a certain density of r&#39;s.So, for each color r, the minimal maximum window size needed to achieve a density of at least 50% from any starting point.But how does the spacing of the color r affect this?If a color is evenly spaced around the circle, then the distance between consecutive r&#39;s is approximately n/m. Then, the maximum distance between two r&#39;s is ceil(n/m) or floor(n/m). So, for example, if n=2021 and m=43, then 2021/43 is 47, so each r is spaced every 47 points. Then, from any starting point, the next r is within 47 points. So, if we take an arc of length 47 starting at any point, it would contain one r, so 1/47 ≈ 2.1%, which is way below 50%. So that&#39;s not helpful.But if the color is arranged in clusters, say two clusters of size m/2, then from any starting point, moving towards the nearest cluster, you can get an arc that includes part of the cluster. For example, if you have two clusters of size m/2, spaced apart. Then, depending on where you start, you might need to traverse some distance to reach a cluster. The length of the arc needed would be the distance from the starting point to the cluster plus the size of the cluster. To have at least half the arc be color r, the number of r&#39;s in the arc (which is up to m/2) must be at least half the length of the arc.So, suppose we have two clusters of size c, separated by gaps of size g. Then, starting at a point in the gap, the arc needs to reach into the cluster. Let&#39;s say the distance from the starting point to the cluster is d. Then, the arc length would be d + x, where x is the number of points into the cluster. The number of r&#39;s in the arc is x. To have x ≥ (d + x)/2 ⇒ 2x ≥ d + x ⇒ x ≥ d. Therefore, the length of the arc is d + x ≥ d + d = 2d. So, x needs to be at least d, but the cluster size is c, so d must be ≤ c. Therefore, the maximum distance from a gap point to the cluster is g/2 (since the gap is size g). Therefore, we need g/2 ≤ c. So, the gap between clusters must be at most 2c. But the total number of points is n = 2c + 2g. Wait, in this case, n = 2 clusters of size c and 2 gaps of size g. So, n = 2c + 2g. Therefore, g = (n - 2c)/2. Then, the condition g/2 ≤ c ⇒ (n - 2c)/4 ≤ c ⇒ n - 2c ≤ 4c ⇒ n ≤ 6c ⇒ c ≥ n/6. So, each cluster must be at least n/6 in size. Therefore, total number of r&#39;s is 2c ≥ n/3. So, each color must be used at least n/3 times.But in our problem, we want to maximize the number of colors k, so minimize the number of times each color is used. If each color is used at least n/3 times, then the maximum k would be floor(n / (n/3)) = 3. So, that would suggest k=3. But this is under the assumption of two clusters per color. Maybe a different arrangement allows for more colors.Wait, but this seems like a rough calculation. Let&#39;s check with n=2021. If each color is used at least 2021/3 ≈ 673.66, so 674 times. Then, the maximum number of colors would be 2021 / 674 ≈ 3. So, three colors. But maybe we can do better.Alternatively, suppose we arrange each color in a single block. If a color is arranged in a single block of size m, then from any starting point, to get an arc with at least half r&#39;s, you would need to traverse from the starting point to the block. The further the starting point is from the block, the longer the arc needed to reach the block. For example, if the block is size m, and the starting point is diametrically opposite, the arc needed to reach the block would be about n/2. Then, in that arc, there are m points of color r. To have m ≥ (n/2)/2 = n/4. Therefore, m ≥ n/4. Therefore, each color must be used at least n/4 times. Then, k ≤ n / (n/4) = 4. So, maybe four colors.But these are just back-of-the-envelope calculations. Let&#39;s think more carefully.Suppose we have a color r used m times. To satisfy the condition that from any starting point, there&#39;s an arc starting there with at least half of the points being r. Let&#39;s consider the worst-case starting point, which is as far as possible from any r points. The maximum distance between two consecutive r points would be ceil(n/m). So, if the color r is evenly spaced, the maximum distance between two r&#39;s is about n/m. Therefore, from a starting point in the middle of the largest gap, the next r is n/m points away. Therefore, the arc starting at that point would have to span at least n/m points to include an r. But in that arc of length n/m, there&#39;s only one r. So, the density is 1/(n/m) = m/n. To have m/n ≥ 1/2 ⇒ m ≥ n/2. Therefore, if the color is evenly spaced, it needs to be used at least n/2 times. But if we arrange the color in clusters, maybe we can do better.Wait, no. If the color is arranged with clusters, the maximum gap between clusters could be larger, but within a cluster, the density is higher. For example, if we have two clusters of size c, separated by a gap of size g. Then, the total number of r&#39;s is 2c, and n = 2c + 2g (assuming two gaps). From a starting point in the gap, the distance to the nearest cluster is g/2. Then, an arc starting there of length g/2 + x, where x is the number of points into the cluster. The number of r&#39;s is x. To have x ≥ (g/2 + x)/2 ⇒ 2x ≥ g/2 + x ⇒ x ≥ g/2. But x can be at most c, so we need c ≥ g/2. Since n = 2c + 2g, substituting g = n - 2c)/2. Then, c ≥ (n - 2c)/4 ⇒ 4c ≥ n - 2c ⇒ 6c ≥ n ⇒ c ≥ n/6. Therefore, total number of r&#39;s is 2c ≥ n/3. So, same as before. So, even with two clusters, each color must be used at least n/3 times.But perhaps with more clusters, we can reduce the required number per color. Let&#39;s suppose we have k clusters of size c for a color, spread equally around the circle. Then, the gap between clusters would be (n - kc)/k. Then, from any starting point in a gap, the distance to the nearest cluster is at most (n - kc)/(2k). Then, the arc length needed to reach the cluster is that distance plus some x points into the cluster. The number of r&#39;s is x, and we need x ≥ (distance + x)/2 ⇒ x ≥ distance. So, x must be at least distance, but x can be up to c. Therefore, distance ≤ c. The distance is (n - kc)/(2k). Therefore, (n - kc)/(2k) ≤ c ⇒ n - kc ≤ 2kc ⇒ n ≤ 3kc ⇒ k ≥ n/(3c). But the total number of r&#39;s is kc. Let m = kc. Then, k = m/c. So, substituting, k ≥ n/(3c) ⇒ m/c ≥ n/(3c) ⇒ m ≥ n/3. So, again, m ≥ n/3. Therefore, regardless of the number of clusters, each color must be used at least n/3 times. Therefore, the maximum number of colors k is at most 3.Wait, that seems to suggest that k cannot exceed 3. Because if each color is used at least n/3 times, then 3 colors would require 3*(n/3) = n points. Since we have exactly n points, each color must be used exactly n/3 times. But 2021 is not divisible by 3. 2021 divided by 3 is 673.666..., so not an integer. Therefore, we can&#39;t have each color exactly 673 or 674. Hmm. So, maybe 3 colors are not possible? Wait, but the problem allows for colors to be used different numbers of times, as long as each color individually satisfies the condition. So, maybe some colors are used more than n/3, allowing others to be used less. But since all colors need to satisfy the condition, each color must be used at least n/3 times. Therefore, even with different distributions, the total number of colors would be limited by the total number of points divided by the minimal number per color, which is n/3. So, k ≤ 3. But since 2021 is not divisible by 3, maybe k=3 is still possible if some colors are used 674 times and others 673. For example, 3 colors with two colors used 674 times and one used 673 times, totaling 674+674+673=2021. But does that distribution allow each color to satisfy the arc condition?Alternatively, maybe 3 colors is possible, but 4 is not. So, the maximum k is 3. But wait, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to arrange the colors so that even with fewer than n/3 points per color, the condition is satisfied. But according to the previous reasoning, arranging in clusters requires n/3 per color. But maybe there&#39;s a different arrangement.Wait, perhaps instead of clusters, arrange the colors in a more staggered pattern. For example, if each color is placed periodically with certain intervals. Suppose we use a repeating pattern of colors such that each color appears regularly. But if a color appears every m points, then the maximum gap between two points of that color is m. Then, from any starting point, the next occurrence is within m points. Then, an arc of length m starting at any point would contain at least one r, so 1/m. For this to be at least half, 1/m ≥ 1/2 ⇒ m ≤ 2. So, each color would have to be placed every 2 points, i.e., at least n/2 times. But that&#39;s worse than the cluster approach. So, periodic placement might not help.Alternatively, maybe using a probabilistic method? Although this is a combinatorial problem, maybe considering expected values or something. But since we need it to hold for every starting point and every color, that might not apply.Wait, perhaps think about it in terms of the Erdos spacing theorem or something similar. Not sure.Alternatively, think of each color needing to &quot;cover&quot; the circle with arcs where they are dense. For each color, the union of these arcs must cover the entire circle because for every starting point, there&#39;s an arc starting there. Therefore, each color&#39;s arcs form an open cover of the circle. Since the circle is compact, there exists a finite subcover. But I&#39;m not sure how helpful that is.Alternatively, for each color r, the set of arcs where r is at least half must cover all starting points. Each arc starts at a point and has some length. The length can vary depending on the starting point. But how do these arcs interact? If two arcs for different colors overlap, how does that affect the coloring?Alternatively, suppose we model this as a hypergraph where each hyperedge is an arc starting at a point with a certain length, and each hyperedge must contain at least half of its vertices colored with a particular color. Then, the problem reduces to covering the hypergraph with hyperedges such that each color&#39;s hyperedges cover all the vertices. But I don&#39;t know if hypergraph theory will help here directly.Wait, perhaps think in terms of majority votes. If from every starting point, a color can &quot;win&quot; a majority in some arc starting there. This is similar to a voting problem where each color must be able to win a majority in some interval starting at any point. The concept of being a &quot;majority color&quot; in some interval for each starting point.In the paper &quot;A Panorama of Discrepancy Theory&quot; or other related literature, there might be similar problems, but I might not recall.Alternatively, here&#39;s an idea. Let&#39;s suppose that each color is a &quot;king&quot; in some rotationally shifted interval. For the maximum k, each color must have a period where it&#39;s densely represented. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the problem in terms of the pigeonhole principle. If there are too many colors, then some color must be used infrequently, making it impossible to satisfy the condition for that color. Therefore, to find the maximum k where even the most infrequent color still satisfies the condition. Therefore, the maximum k is the largest integer such that the most infrequent color is still frequent enough to satisfy the arc condition.So, if we have k colors, then the minimum number of points per color is at least n/k. So, if n/k is too small, then that color can&#39;t satisfy the arc condition. From previous analysis, we saw that a color needs to be used at least n/3 times. Therefore, n/k ≥ n/3 ⇒ k ≤ 3. Therefore, maximum k is 3. But n=2021 is not divisible by 3, so maybe k=3 is still possible if the colors are distributed as evenly as possible.Wait, but even if the colors are distributed as 674, 674, 673, then each color is used at least 673 times. Let&#39;s check if 673 is sufficient. Suppose we have a color used 673 times. Then, using the cluster approach, if we split into two clusters of 336 or 337. Wait, 673 is odd, so two clusters would be 336 and 337. Then, the gaps between clusters would be (2021 - 673)/2 = (1348)/2 = 674. So, each gap is 674 points. Then, from a starting point in the gap, the distance to the nearest cluster is 674/2 = 337. Then, the arc needed to reach the cluster is 337 + x, where x is the number of points into the cluster. The number of r&#39;s is x. So, to satisfy x ≥ (337 + x)/2 ⇒ 2x ≥ 337 + x ⇒ x ≥ 337. But the cluster size is 336 or 337. If the cluster is 337, then x can be up to 337, so x=337 satisfies x ≥ 337. Therefore, the arc length would be 337 + 337 = 674. So, in that arc of 674 points, there are 337 r&#39;s, which is exactly half. Since the problem says &quot;at least half,&quot; that&#39;s okay. But the other cluster is 336. If we start at a point in the gap near the 336 cluster, the distance is 337, then x needs to be ≥337, but the cluster only has 336 points. Therefore, x=336, which is less than 337. Then, 336 ≥ (337 + 336)/2 ⇒ 336 ≥ 336.5, which is false. Therefore, that doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, splitting into two clusters of 336 and 337 with gaps of 674 doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition for the smaller cluster. Therefore, this approach fails.Alternatively, maybe split into three clusters? If a color is used 673 times, split into three clusters of 224 or 225. Let me see. 673 divided by 3 is 224.333. So, two clusters of 224 and one of 225. Then, the gaps between clusters would be (2021 - 673)/3 ≈ (1348)/3 ≈ 449.333. So, gaps of 449 or 450. Then, starting in a gap of 450, the distance to the nearest cluster is 225. Then, the arc length needed is 225 + x. The number of r&#39;s is x. So, x ≥ (225 + x)/2 ⇒ x ≥ 225. But the cluster sizes are 224 or 225. For the cluster of 225, x=225 satisfies, but for the clusters of 224, x=224 &lt; 225. Therefore, again, insufficient.Hmm. So, splitting into clusters may not work if the cluster size is less than half the gap. Wait, in order for x ≥ distance, where distance is half the gap. So, if the cluster size is at least half the gap, then it&#39;s okay. But if the cluster size is smaller, then it&#39;s not. Therefore, maybe the cluster size needs to be at least half the gap. Let&#39;s formalize that.Suppose we have a total of m = n - k*c points not colored r, spread over k gaps. Then, each gap is size g = (n - m)/k. Then, from a starting point in the gap, the distance to the cluster is g/2. The cluster size is c. To satisfy x ≥ g/2, where x is the cluster size. Therefore, c ≥ g/2 ⇒ c ≥ (n - m)/(2k). But m is the number of points colored r, so m = k*c. Wait, no. Wait, if there are k clusters of size c, then total r&#39;s is k*c. Therefore, the remaining points are n - k*c, spread over k gaps, each gap of size g = (n - k*c)/k. Then, c ≥ g/2 ⇒ c ≥ (n - k*c)/(2k) ⇒ 2k*c ≥ n - k*c ⇒ 3k*c ≥ n ⇒ c ≥ n/(3k). But since m = k*c, then m = k*c ≥ k*(n/(3k)) = n/3. Therefore, again, m ≥ n/3. So, each color must be used at least n/3 times.Therefore, regardless of the number of clusters, each color must be used at least n/3 times. Therefore, maximum k is 3. But since n=2021 is not divisible by 3, we have to check if k=3 is possible with colors used 674, 674, and 673 times.But as we saw earlier, splitting into two clusters for each color may not work because of the leftover points. Maybe another arrangement?Alternatively, maybe interleaving the colors in some regular pattern. For example, if we partition the circle into three equal parts and color each part with a different color. But 2021 divided by 3 is approximately 673.666, so not integer. Therefore, each third would be 674, 674, 673 points. If each color is assigned to one third, then from any starting point, moving into the corresponding third would give an arc of that color. But since the circle is continuous, starting at a point between two thirds, the arc would have to enter one of the thirds. However, if you start at the boundary between two colors, say color 1 and color 2, then an arc starting there could go into color 1&#39;s third or color 2&#39;s third. But the length of the arc needed to reach a third with 674 points would be up to 674 points. However, in such an arc, only the color of that third would be present. Therefore, the density would be 100% for that color, which certainly satisfies the condition. But wait, if the entire third is colored with one color, then from any starting point, you can take an arc that enters that third, giving a 100% density. Therefore, that would satisfy the condition. But since the circle is divided into three parts, each color is in one contiguous arc. But if you start at a point outside that arc, you can take an arc that goes into the color&#39;s arc. However, the problem states that for each color and each starting point, there must be an arc starting at that point where the color is at least half. If the color is in a contiguous arc, then starting outside of that arc, you need to traverse all the way around to reach it. Wait, but on a circle, starting at any point, you can go clockwise or counterclockwise. But the problem says &quot;an arc&quot;, which is typically considered in one direction, say clockwise. So, if the color is in a contiguous block, then starting at a point not in the block, you have to go clockwise until you reach the block. The length of that arc would be the distance from the starting point to the block. If the block is size m, then the maximum distance from a point to the block is n - m. So, if you start at the point diametrically opposite to the block, the distance is floor(n/2) - floor(m/2). For n=2021, which is odd, the diameter is about 1010 or 1011 points. If the block is size m=674, then the distance from the farthest point is 2021 - 674 = 1347, but that&#39;s the total points not in the block. Wait, no. The distance from a point to the block is the number of points you have to traverse clockwise to reach the block. If the block is a single contiguous arc of 674 points, then the remaining points are 2021 - 674 = 1347, which are split into two arcs on either side of the block. Wait, no. On a circle, if you have a block of 674 points, the remaining 1347 points form a single arc (since it&#39;s a circle). Wait, no. If you have a circle and you color a contiguous block of 674 points, the remaining points are 2021 - 674 = 1347, which is a single arc (since the circle is continuous). Therefore, the maximum distance from a starting point to the block is 1347 points. Therefore, starting at the first point after the block, you have to traverse 1347 points to get back to the block. Therefore, an arc starting there of length 1348 would include the entire block (674) plus 1347 points, but wait, no. Wait, starting at a point just after the block, an arc of length 674 would cover the 1347 points plus wrap around? Wait, I&#39;m confused.Wait, the circle has 2021 points. A block of 674 contiguous points. The remaining 1347 points form a single contiguous arc (since it&#39;s a circle). Therefore, the maximum distance from a point to the block is 1347 points. Therefore, starting at a point in the remaining arc, the distance to the block is the number of points between that starting point and the block. If you start at the point diametrically opposite, the distance would be 1347/2 ≈ 673.5, so 674 points. Therefore, an arc starting at that point of length 674 would reach the block. In that arc, there are 674 points, of which 0 are color r (since the block is 674 points, but the arc of 674 starting at the opposite point would overlap with the block by ... Wait, no. If the block is 674 points, and you start 674 points away, the arc of length 674 would exactly reach the start of the block. Therefore, in that arc, there are 0 points of color r until the last point, which is the start of the block. Therefore, only 1 point of color r in an arc of length 674. That&#39;s a density of 1/674 ≈ 0.15%, which is way below 50%. Therefore, this does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, arranging a color in a single block doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, the earlier approach of splitting into two clusters might be necessary, but as we saw, due to the indivisibility of 2021, it&#39;s problematic.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another way to arrange the colors. If we arrange each color in a way that they are spaced such that between any two points of a color, there are at most some number of points. Let&#39;s suppose that for a color r used m times, the maximum gap between consecutive r&#39;s is g. Then, from any starting point, the next r is within g points. Then, an arc of length g starting at that point will contain at least one r. To have the density of r&#39;s be at least half, we need the number of r&#39;s in the arc ≥ g/2. Since the number of r&#39;s is at least 1, this requires 1 ≥ g/2 ⇒ g ≤ 2. Therefore, the maximum gap between r&#39;s must be ≤ 2. Therefore, each color must be placed such that between any two consecutive r&#39;s, there are at most 2 non-r points. Therefore, each color must be placed at least every 3 points. Therefore, the number of r&#39;s m must satisfy m ≥ ceil(n/3). For n=2021, ceil(2021/3) = 674. Therefore, each color must be used at least 674 times. Therefore, the maximum number of colors k is floor(2021 / 674) = 3. So, 3 colors.But let&#39;s check. If each color is used 674 times, then 3 colors would require 3*674=2022 points, which is one more than we have. Therefore, it&#39;s not possible. So, two colors with 674 and one color with 673. Let&#39;s see. Suppose two colors have 674 points each, and one color has 673. For the two colors with 674, they can be arranged such that between any two consecutive points of the same color, there are at most two other points. For example, repeating every three points: r, x, x, r, x, x, etc. But with 674 points, this would require 3*674 -2 = 2020 points, which is close to 2021. Similarly, the third color with 673 points could be arranged in a similar pattern. But the problem is that overlapping colors would interfere. If two colors are each trying to occupy every third point, they would collide. Therefore, arranging three colors each every three points is impossible because of overlap.Alternatively, use a different spacing. Suppose each color is arranged such that no two colors are in the same position. If each color is placed every 3 points but offset by 1, 2, and 3 positions. However, with three colors, each every 3 points, you would need 3*674 points, which is too many. So, this approach might not work.Alternatively, perhaps using a more efficient interleaving. For example, a repeating pattern of 1,2,3,1,2,3,... which uses three colors each appearing every three points. This would give n/3 points per color. But since 2021 isn&#39;t divisible by 3, we&#39;d have 673, 673, 675 or something. But in this case, from any starting point, an arc of length 3 would contain one of each color, so 1/3 density. That&#39;s below 50%. Therefore, this does not satisfy the condition.Wait, but the problem allows arcs of any length. So, even if in the repeating 1,2,3 pattern, from any starting point, you can choose an arc of length 1, which is just the starting point. If that point is color r, then the density is 100%. If it&#39;s not, then an arc of length 3 would have one of each color. But that&#39;s only 1/3, which is less than 50%. So, to get at least half, you might need a longer arc. For example, if starting at a color 1, take an arc of length 1. If starting at a color 2, take an arc of length 2: color 2 and 3. But 1/2 is 50%. If starting at color 3, take an arc of length 2: color 3 and 1. 1/2 again. But in this case, the condition is barely met for arcs of length 2 starting at a non-r color. But wait, the problem says &quot;at least half&quot;, so 1/2 is acceptable. Wait, but in an arc of length 2 starting at a non-r color, there is one r and one non-r. So, exactly 50%. Therefore, it&#39;s acceptable. But in this case, each color is used n/3 times. However, since n=2021 is not divisible by 3, the actual counts would be 674, 673, 674. Therefore, two colors are used 674 times, one used 673 times. Let&#39;s see if this works.Suppose the points are colored in a repeating sequence 1,2,3,1,2,3,... for 2021 points. The sequence would end at the 2021st point, which would be color 1 (since 2021 divided by 3 is 673 with remainder 2: 3*673=2019, so 2020 is color 1, 2021 is color 2). Wait, actually:Wait, 2021 divided by 3 is 673 with a remainder of 2. So, the first 2019 points are 673 cycles of 1,2,3. Then, points 2020 and 2021 would be colors 1 and 2. Therefore, color 1 appears 674 times (673*2 +1), color 2 appears 674 times (673*2 +1), and color 3 appears 673 times. Now, check the condition for each color.Take color 3, which appears 673 times. In the repeating pattern, color 3 appears every third point. So, the maximum gap between color 3s is 3 points (since it&#39;s periodic). Therefore, from any starting point, the next color 3 is within 3 points. Therefore, an arc starting at any point of length 3 will include a color 3. But in an arc of length 3, there&#39;s one color 3, so density 1/3 ≈ 33.3%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, this does not satisfy the condition. So, the repeating pattern doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, arranging the colors periodically with equal spacing doesn&#39;t suffice because the density in arcs of length equal to the period is too low. Therefore, we need a different arrangement.Another approach: For each color, ensure that around every point, there&#39;s a nearby high-density region for that color. If we can arrange each color such that within a certain distance from any point, there&#39;s a cluster of that color. Maybe overlapping clusters for different colors.Alternatively, think of each color&#39;s occurrence as forming a covering of the circle with overlapping arcs where each arc has at least half of that color. Then, the problem requires that these arcs exist starting at every point for each color.This resembles the concept of a covering code or covering radius in coding theory, where each point is within a certain distance from a codeword. Here, each starting point must be within an arc (of variable length) that contains a sufficient number of the color.But perhaps another angle: For each color r, the set of points colored r must form a &quot;dominating set&quot; in the sense that every point is either in r or is adjacent to a sufficient number of r&#39;s within some arc.Wait, not exactly. It&#39;s not about adjacency but about the density in some arc.Let me consider an example. Suppose we have three colors, each used roughly 673 or 674 times. Arrange each color in a way that every third point is that color, but offset so that their clusters interleave.Wait, but again, if they&#39;re interleaved, the density per arc might not reach 50%. For example, if color 1 is at positions 1,4,7,..., color 2 at 2,5,8,..., and color 3 at 3,6,9,..., then from any starting point, an arc of length 3 would have one of each color. But that&#39;s density 1/3, which is insufficient. However, if we take longer arcs, say length 5, then maybe two of one color. But it depends on the arrangement.Alternatively, suppose we arrange each color in blocks of two consecutive points, separated by single points of other colors. For example, color 1: positions 1,2; color 2: 4,5; color 3: 7,8; and so on. Then, from any starting point, if you start in a block, take an arc of length 2 (100% density). If you start between blocks, take an arc of length 3: two of one color and one other. So, density 2/3, which is above 50%. This could work.But how many colors can we fit? If we have blocks of two points per color, separated by one point, then each color uses 2 points every 3 positions. So, for n=2021, the number of colors would be floor(n/3). Wait, no. Each block of 3 points contains two of one color and one of another? Wait, no. If each color is a block of two, separated by one, then the pattern would be A,A,B,B,C,C,A,A,B,B,C,C,... but with separators. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, repeating every three points: A,A,B,A,A,B,... but this might not cycle properly. Alternatively, using three colors in a pattern like A,A,B,B,C,C,A,A,B,B,C,C,... which repeats every 6 points. In this case, each color appears twice every 6 points, so n/3 times. For n=2021, this would give approximately 337 occurrences per color. But 337*3=1011, which is less than 2021. So, not sure.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. If we can partition the circle into arcs where each arc is majority colored by some color, and these arcs overlap such that every point is covered by an arc of each color. But the problem requires that for each color and each starting point, there is an arc starting at that point with majority of that color. So, perhaps the circle is covered by arcs for each color, where each arc starts at every point. This seems too vague.Wait, maybe the maximum k is 3, as per previous reasoning, and the answer is boxed{3}. But I need to verify.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the following: If we have k colors, then each color must be such that for any point, there&#39;s an arc starting at that point where the color has density ≥ 1/2. To achieve this, the color must not be too &quot;spread out&quot;. Specifically, if a color is too infrequent, then there exist long gaps between its occurrences, making it impossible to have a dense arc from some starting points.From the earlier analysis, using the pigeonhole principle, if a color occurs m times, then the maximum gap between two consecutive occurrences is at least ⌈n/m⌉. Therefore, to ensure that in any arc starting at a point, we can find an arc of length at most ⌈n/m⌉ that contains at least one occurrence of the color. But to have density ≥ 1/2, we need that within an arc of length L starting at any point, the number of color r points is ≥ L/2. The number of color r points in such an arc is at least the number of times the color occurs in the arc. If the color is distributed with maximum gap g, then in the worst case, an arc of length g will contain at least one r. But to have density 1/2, we need 1 ≥ g/2 ⇒ g ≤ 2. Therefore, the maximum gap g must be ≤ 2. Therefore, m ≥ ⌈n/3⌉. For n=2021, ⌈n/3⌉ = 674. Therefore, each color must occur at least 674 times, so the maximum k is ⌊2021 / 674⌋ = 3, since 3*674=2022 &gt;2021, so 3-1=2? Wait, no. Wait, 2021 divided by 674 is approximately 2.997. So, floor(2021 /674)=3, but 3*674=2022. Therefore, we can have two colors with 674 points and one color with 2021 - 2*674 = 2021 -1348=673 points. But the color with 673 points would have a maximum gap of ⌈2021/673⌉=3. Therefore, there exists a gap of 3 between some two occurrences of this color. Therefore, starting at the point in the middle of this gap, an arc of length 3 would be needed to reach the next occurrence. But in such an arc, there is one occurrence of the color, so density 1/3 &lt;1/2, which violates the condition. Therefore, the color with 673 points doesn&#39;t satisfy the requirement. Therefore, k=3 is impossible.Therefore, the maximum k is 2. Let&#39;s check. If we have two colors, each used 1010 or 1011 points. For example, color 1 with 1010 points and color 2 with 1011 points. If color 1 is used 1010 times, then the maximum gap between color 1 points is ⌈2021/1010⌉=3. Therefore, there exists a gap of 3. Starting in the middle of that gap, an arc of length 3 would contain one color 1 point, density 1/3 &lt;1/2. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work either.Wait, so maybe even two colors is impossible? But that can&#39;t be. If we have two colors, say alternating colors, but then from any starting point, an arc of length 2 would have one of each color, which is 50%. So, acceptable. But if we have more points of one color than the other. Wait, but 2021 is odd, so one color must be used 1011 times, the other 1010. So, suppose color 1 is used 1011 times, color 2 1010 times. If arranged alternately as much as possible, we would have a pattern like 1,2,1,2,..., ending with an extra 1. Then, from any starting point, an arc of length 1: if it&#39;s color 1, done. If it&#39;s color 2, then an arc of length 2 would be color 2 and 1. So, one of each, 50%. Which is acceptable. An arc of length 3 would have two of one color and one of the other, depending on where you start. For example, starting at color 1: arc length 3: 1,2,1 – two 1&#39;s, density 2/3. Starting at color 2: arc length 3: 2,1,2 – two 2&#39;s, density 2/3. But the problem allows variable arc lengths. So, if from any starting point, you can choose the arc length. For example, if you start at a color 2 point, you can choose an arc of length 1 (which is color 2, 100%), or length 2 (color 2 and 1, 50%). Therefore, to satisfy the condition for color 2, you need an arc where at least half are color 2. If you start at a color 2 point, the arc of length 1 (just itself) is 100%, which is fine. If you start at a color 1 point, you need an arc starting there with at least half color 2. But in the alternating pattern, an arc starting at color 1 of length 2 would be 1,2 – one of each. 50%. An arc of length 3 would be 1,2,1 – two 1&#39;s, one 2. So, color 1 is majority. Therefore, to find an arc with at least half color 2, starting at a color 1 point, you need to take an arc of length 1 (color 1) or length 2 (1,2). Neither gives a majority of color 2. Wait, this is a problem.Wait, in the alternating pattern, starting at a color 1 point, any arc of even length would have equal numbers, and odd length would have one more 1. Therefore, there is no arc starting at a color 1 point with a majority of color 2. Therefore, the alternating pattern doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition for color 2 from color 1 starting points. Therefore, two colors in an alternating pattern don&#39;t work.But perhaps a different arrangement. Suppose we arrange color 2 in two large blocks and color 1 in the remaining points. For example, color 2 is arranged in two blocks of 505 points each, totaling 1010, and color 1 is the remaining 1011 points. Then, from a starting point in a color 1 region, an arc entering a color 2 block would need to have at least half color 2. The distance from a starting point in the color 1 region to the color 2 block is up to (1011 - size of gap)/2. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it&#39;s similar to the earlier cluster approach.If color 2 is in two blocks of 505, then the gaps between blocks are (2021 - 1010)/2 = 505.5, so 505 and 506 points. From a starting point in the gap of 506, the distance to the nearest color 2 block is 253. Then, an arc of length 253 + 505 = 758 would include 505 color 2 points and 253 color 1 points. Total points 758, color 2 points 505, which is 505/758 ≈ 66.6%, which is above 50%. Therefore, this satisfies the condition for color 2. Similarly, for color 1, which is 1011 points, if it&#39;s arranged in the remaining space, which is two blocks of 505.5, so 505 and 506. From any starting point, the arc can enter a color 1 block. The maximum distance to a color 1 block would be 505/2 = 252.5, so 253. An arc of length 253 + 506 = 759 would include 506 color 1 and 253 color 2, which is 506/759 ≈ 66.6%. Therefore, this satisfies the condition for color 1 as well.Therefore, arranging the two colors in two large blocks each allows the condition to be satisfied. Therefore, two colors are possible.But what about three colors? Suppose we try to split the circle into three colors, each with around 674 points. Arrange each color in two clusters of 337 points. Then, the gaps between clusters would be (2021 - 674)/2 = 673.5, so 673 and 674. From a starting point in a gap of 674, the distance to the nearest cluster is 337. An arc of length 337 + 337 = 674 would include 337 color r points and 337 other colors. That&#39;s exactly 50%, which is acceptable. But if the cluster is only 337, then in the arc of 674 points, half are color r. Therefore, this works. But for the third color, which has one less cluster (wait, no, each color has two clusters). Wait, each color has two clusters. For three colors, each with two clusters, the total clusters would be six, alternating around the circle. Each cluster is 337 or 338 points. Wait, but 3 colors * 2 clusters = 6 clusters. 6 clusters * 337 = 2022, which is one more than 2021. Therefore, it&#39;s not possible.Alternatively, have three colors each arranged in a single cluster. But as we saw earlier, this doesn&#39;t work because starting opposite the cluster gives low density.Alternatively, interleave three colors in such a way that each color&#39;s clusters are spaced such that from any starting point, an arc can reach a cluster with sufficient density. But this seems complex and likely doesn&#39;t resolve the issue that a color with 673 points can&#39;t cover the circle with sufficient arcs.Given that two colors are possible, but three colors run into the issue of one color being short by one point and thus failing the density condition, it seems the maximum k is 2.Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that if each color is used at least n/3 times, which would be ~673, then three colors might be possible. But the problem arises with the actual distribution due to the indivisibility of 2021.Alternatively, maybe a different arrangement allows three colors. Suppose we divide the circle into three interlaced segments, each assigned to a different color. For example, divide the circle into three equal parts, but since 2021 isn&#39;t divisible by three, make them 674, 674, 673. Assign each part to a color. Then, from any starting point, moving into the corresponding color&#39;s segment would give a high density. However, as we saw earlier, if a color is in a contiguous block, starting opposite to it would require a long arc with low density. However, if the segments are interlaced (not contiguous), such that each color is spread out in a way that from any point, a short arc can reach a high-density region.Wait, but how to interlace three segments of 674, 674, 673 without overlap. It&#39;s tricky. Maybe using a star-like pattern where each color is placed every three points, but again, the density per arc would be too low.Alternatively, consider a more sophisticated pattern. For example, each color is arranged in a periodic fashion with period 3, but with varying offsets. For instance, color 1 at positions 1,4,7,..., color 2 at 2,5,8,..., color 3 at 3,6,9,.... This gives each color appearing approximately 674 times. From any starting point, an arc of length 2 would contain two different colors, so 1/2 density. But we need an arc with at least half of a specific color. For example, starting at position 1 (color 1), an arc of length 1 is 100% color 1. Starting at position 2 (color 2), an arc of length 1 is 100% color 2. Starting at position 3 (color 3), similarly. Starting at position 4 (color 1), etc. However, if you start at a position between the defined points, like position 2.5 (which doesn&#39;t exist), but all positions are integers. Wait, positions are discrete. So, in this arrangement, every position is assigned a color. From any starting position p, which is color r, an arc of length 1 is 100% r. For a different color s, starting at p, you need an arc where at least half are s. For example, starting at a color 1 point, to find an arc with at least half color 2. The next color 2 point is at position p+1 (if p is 1 mod 3). An arc from p of length 2 would include color 1 and color 2, which is 50%. That&#39;s acceptable. Similarly, starting at a color 1 point, an arc of length 3 would include color 1, color 2, color 3. So, 1/3 density for each. Not helpful. Therefore, for color 2, starting at a color 1 point, the arc of length 2 is 50% color 2, which meets the condition. Similarly, for color 3, starting at a color 1 point, the next color 3 is at position p+2. An arc of length 3 would include color 1, color 2, color 3. Density 1/3. Not enough. But an arc of length 1 at p is color 1, length 2: 1,2; length 3:1,2,3; length 4:1,2,3,1. In length 4, two color 1&#39;s, one color 2, one color 3. Still not majority for color 3. Wait, so starting at a color 1 point, there is no arc starting there with at least half color 3. The only arcs with color 3 are length 3, 6, etc., but in those arcs, color 3 is only 1/3, 2/6, etc. Therefore, the density is too low. Therefore, this arrangement doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition for color 3 from a color 1 starting point. Hence, three colors in this periodic pattern don&#39;t work.Therefore, after exploring various arrangements, it seems that achieving three colors is not possible due to the density requirements and the indivisibility of 2021, whereas two colors are possible by arranging them in large blocks. Hence, the maximum k is 2.But wait, before finalizing that answer, let me verify the two-color case more carefully. Suppose we use two colors, red and blue. Red is used 1011 times, blue 1010 times. Arrange red in two blocks of 505 and 506 points, and blue in the remaining two blocks of 505 each. Then, the circle alternates between red, blue, red, blue. Each red block is 505 or 506, and each blue block is 505. The total is 505+505+506+505=2021. Now, consider any starting point. If it&#39;s in a red block, an arc of length 1 is red. If it&#39;s in a blue block, an arc of length 1 is blue. For the other color, starting in a red block, to find an arc with at least half blue, you&#39;d need to go into the blue block. The distance from a red block to a blue block is zero if you&#39;re at the boundary. Otherwise, the maximum distance within a red block to the nearest blue block is up to 505 or 506 points. Wait, no. If the red block is 505 points, starting in the middle, the distance to the nearest blue block is 252. Then, an arc of length 252 + 505 = 757 points would include 505 blue and 252 red, which is 505/757 ≈ 66.7% blue, satisfying the condition. Similarly, starting in a blue block, to find a red arc, the distance to the nearest red block is up to 505/2 = 252, and an arc of length 252 + 506 = 758 includes 506 red and 252 blue, which is 506/758 ≈ 66.7% red. Therefore, this satisfies the condition for both colors. Therefore, two colors are possible.What about three colors? If we try to divide into three colors, each needing around 673-674 points. Suppose we have three colors: red, blue, green. Each color is arranged in two clusters. For red: 337 and 337 points; blue: 337 and 337; green: 336 and 337. Total red: 674, blue: 674, green: 673. The gaps between clusters would be (2021 - total color)/2. For red: (2021 - 674)/2 = 673.5, so gaps of 673 and 674. Similarly for blue. For green: (2021 - 673)/2 = 674. So, gaps of 674 each.From a starting point in a gap of 674 (for red), the distance to the nearest red cluster is 337. An arc of length 337 + 337 = 674 would include 337 red and 337 non-red. Exactly 50% red, which is acceptable. For green, starting in a gap of 674, distance to green cluster is 337, arc length 337 + 336 = 673. But green cluster is 336, so in arc length 673, 336 green and 337 non-green. 336/673 ≈ 49.9%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, this fails for green.Therefore, three colors cannot be arranged in two clusters each without one color failing the density condition. Hence, three colors are not possible.Therefore, the maximum possible k is 2.Final Answerboxed{2}</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>✅:</span>Given 2021 points on a circle, each colored with one of the colors (1, 2, ldots, k), we need to find the maximum (k) such that for every color (r) and every starting point, there exists an arc starting at that point where at least half of the points on the arc are colored with (r).1. Analysis of the Problem:   - For each color (r) and each starting point, there must be an arc starting at that point where at least half of the points are color (r).   - This implies that each color must be distributed such that from any starting point, there is a sufficiently dense arc of that color.2. Key Considerations:   - If a color is used too sparsely, it cannot satisfy the density requirement.   - Using the pigeonhole principle, if a color is used (m) times, the maximum gap between consecutive points of that color is (lceil frac{2021}{m} rceil).   - To achieve at least half density in some arc, the maximum gap must be limited, leading to the requirement that each color must be used at least (lceil frac{2021}{3} rceil = 674) times.3. Feasibility of Different Color Counts:   - Three Colors: Each color would need to be used approximately 674 times. However, due to the indivisibility of 2021, one color would be used 673 times, leading to gaps where the density requirement fails.   - Two Colors: Can be arranged in large blocks with sufficient density. For example, using two colors with 1010 and 1011 points each, arranged in blocks that allow arcs of sufficient density from any starting point.4. Verification of Two Colors:   - Arranging two colors in large blocks ensures that from any starting point, an arc can be found with the required density. This configuration satisfies the problem&#39;s condition for both colors.5. Conclusion:   - Three colors fail due to the density requirement gaps caused by the indivisibility of 2021.   - Two colors can be arranged to meet the density requirement for all starting points.Thus, the maximum possible value of (k) is (boxed{2}).</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>🔑:</span>1. Initial Setup and Example:   - We are given 2021 points on a circle, each colored with one of ( k ) colors.   - We need to find the maximum possible value of ( k ) such that for every color ( 1 leq r leq k ), there exists an arc where at least half of the points on it are colored with ( r ).   - Example: If ( k = 2 ), we can color the points alternately with two colors, say 1 and 2. This configuration works because any arc containing half the points will have at least half of them colored with either color 1 or color 2.2. Proof that ( k leq 2 ):   - Assume for contradiction that ( k geq 3 ).   - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be a color that appears at most ( leftlceil frac{2021}{3} rightrceil = 674 ) times. Let this color be color 1.   - The number of points not colored by 1 is at least ( 2021 - 674 = 1347 ).3. Definition of Arc ( Y_i ):   - For each point ( a_i ) not colored by 1, define ( Y_i ) as the shortest arc containing ( a_i ) such that at least half of the points on it are colored by 1.4. Claim 1: One endpoint of ( Y_i ) is ( a_i ):   - Suppose the contrary, and let the endpoints of ( Y_i ) be ( m ) and ( n ).   - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( m ) and ( a_i ) (excluding ( a_i )), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - Similarly, let ( t_1 ) be the number of points between ( n ) and ( a_i ) (excluding ( a_i )), and ( t_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - We know ( z_2 &lt; frac{z_1 + 1}{2} ) (otherwise, the arc from ( m ) to ( a_i ) would be shorter and suitable for ( a_i )).   - Thus, ( z_2 leq frac{z_1}{2} ).   - Similarly, ( t_2 leq frac{t_1}{2} ).   - Therefore, ( z_2 + t_2 leq frac{z_1 + t_1}{2} ).   - However, we also know ( z_2 + t_2 geq frac{z_1 + t_1 + 1}{2} ), leading to a contradiction.5. Claim 2: The second endpoint of ( Y_i ) is colored by 1:   - Suppose the contrary, and let the second endpoint of ( Y_i ) be ( m ), which is not colored by 1.   - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( m ) and ( a_i ) (both included), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - We know ( z_2 geq frac{z_1}{2} ).   - Removing ( m ) from the arc ( Y_i ) results in a shorter arc, and since ( z_2 &gt; frac{z_1 - 1}{2} ), the new arc still satisfies the condition, leading to a contradiction.6. Claim 3: Exactly half of the points on ( Y_i ) are colored by 1:   - Suppose the contrary, and let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) (both included), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - If ( z_2 &gt; frac{z_1}{2} ), then ( z_2 geq frac{z_1 + 1}{2} ).   - Removing ( b_i ) from the arc ( Y_i ) results in a shorter arc, and since ( z_2 - 1 geq frac{z_1 - 1}{2} ), the new arc still satisfies the condition, leading to a contradiction.7. Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:   - For each arc ( Y_i ), consider the point ( b_i ). All ( b_i ) points are colored by 1 (Claim 2).   - There are at most 674 points colored by 1 and at least 1347 arcs.   - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least 3 arcs with the same endpoint.   - WLOG, let ( Y_m, Y_n, Y_p ) have the same endpoint ( b_1 ).   - These arcs are on the same circle and end at the same point, so there must be 2 arcs where one covers the other.   - WLOG, let ( Y_m ) cover ( Y_n ). Let ( a_m ) and ( a_n ) be their starting points.   - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_m ) and ( a_n ) (excluding ( a_n )), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - Let ( t_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_n ) and ( b_1 ) (both included), and ( t_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - By Claim 3, ( t_2 = frac{t_1}{2} ) (arc ( Y_n )) and ( z_2 + t_2 = frac{z_1 + t_1}{2} ) (arc ( Y_m )).   - Thus, ( z_2 = frac{z_1}{2} ).   - Consider the arc starting at ( a_m ) and ending just before ( a_n ) (arc ( Y_m - Y_n )).   - On this arc, there are ( z_1 ) points and ( z_2 ) of them are colored by 1.   - Since ( z_2 = frac{z_1}{2} ), this arc is suitable for ( a_m ), contradicting the assumption that ( Y_i ) was the shortest arc suitable for ( a_m ).8. Conclusion:   - Therefore, ( k leq 2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2 } ).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-d9c3ddfb data-v-6400c8a0><div class="review" data-v-6400c8a0><div class="review-title" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>❓:</span>Triangle  ABC  has side lengths  AB=13, BC=14,  and  CA=15 .

The problem involves various points like the orthocenter H, intersections of lines with the circumcircle Γ, and then finding where DG intersects AC at X. Then, compute the area of HDXF. Hmm, that&#39;s a bit involved. Let me start breaking it down step by step.First, I should recall that in any triangle, the orthocenter H is the intersection point of the three altitudes. Given that ABC has sides 13, 14, 15, which I recognize as a well-known triangle with specific properties. Wait, the 13-14-15 triangle isn&#39;t a right-angled triangle, but maybe it&#39;s a Heronian triangle? Let me check: Heronian triangles have integer sides and integer area. The semi-perimeter would be (13+14+15)/2 = 21. Then area using Heron&#39;s formula is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[21*8*7*6] = sqrt[21*8*42] = sqrt[7056] = 84. Yes, area is 84. That&#39;s a key piece of information. So area of ABC is 84.Now, maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle to make calculations easier. Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (14,0), since BC=14. Then points A, B, C need to be positioned such that AB=13 and AC=15. Let me find coordinates for A.Let’s denote coordinates:Let B = (0,0)C = (14,0)Let A = (x,y). Then distances AB=13, AC=15.So distance from A to B: sqrt(x² + y²) = 13 =&gt; x² + y² = 169Distance from A to C: sqrt((x -14)^2 + y²) =15 =&gt; (x-14)^2 + y² =225Subtracting first equation from the second:(x-14)^2 + y² - x² - y² =225 -169Expanding (x² -28x +196) -x² =56So -28x +196 =56 =&gt; -28x=56-196= -140 =&gt; x=5Then from x² + y²=169, x=5, so 25 + y²=169 =&gt; y²=144 =&gt; y=12 or -12. Let&#39;s take y=12, so A=(5,12).So coordinates:A(5,12), B(0,0), C(14,0)Alright, so now we have coordinate system. Let me confirm the lengths:AB: distance from (5,12) to (0,0): sqrt(25+144)=13. Correct.AC: distance from (5,12) to (14,0): sqrt(9² +12²)=sqrt(81+144)=sqrt(225)=15. Correct.BC is 14. Perfect. So coordinates are set.Now, need to find the orthocenter H. The orthocenter is the intersection of the altitudes.Let me compute equations of two altitudes and find their intersection.First, find the altitude from A to BC. Since BC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (14,0), the altitude from A is vertical? Wait, BC is horizontal, so the altitude from A is vertical if BC is horizontal. Wait, no. The altitude from A is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is horizontal (along x-axis), the altitude from A is vertical. But wait, the slope of BC is 0, so the altitude from A is vertical, so equation is x=5. Because A is at (5,12), so the altitude from A is the vertical line x=5, intersecting BC at (5,0). So foot of the altitude from A is D1=(5,0).Then, another altitude, say from B to AC. Let me compute the equation of AC. Points A(5,12) and C(14,0). The slope of AC is (0-12)/(14-5)= -12/9= -4/3. Therefore, the altitude from B to AC is perpendicular to AC, so its slope is reciprocal and opposite: 3/4.So equation of altitude from B: passes through B(0,0) with slope 3/4. So equation is y = (3/4)x.Find intersection of this altitude with AC. Equation of AC: from points A(5,12) and C(14,0). Let me write its equation.Parametric equations or slope-intercept. Let&#39;s do slope-intercept. Slope is -4/3, so equation is y -12 = (-4/3)(x -5). So y = (-4/3)x + 20/3 +12 = (-4/3)x + 20/3 +36/3 = (-4/3)x + 56/3.So equation of AC is y= (-4/3)x +56/3.Equation of altitude from B: y=(3/4)x.Find intersection point. Set (3/4)x = (-4/3)x +56/3.Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:12*(3/4)x =12*(-4/3)x +12*(56/3)9x = -16x +2249x +16x =22425x=224 =&gt; x=224/25=8.96Then y=(3/4)x=(3/4)*(224/25)= (672)/100=6.72So coordinates of the foot of altitude from B to AC is (224/25, 672/100)= (224/25, 168/25). Let me check:Wait, (3/4)*(224/25)= (3*224)/(4*25)= (672)/100=168/25=6.72. Correct.But this is the foot of the altitude from B. The altitude itself is the line from B(0,0) to (224/25,168/25). But actually, since we already have the equation of the altitude as y=(3/4)x, and the equation of AC as y= (-4/3)x +56/3, their intersection is the foot, which we found as (224/25,168/25). So, H is the orthocenter, intersection of altitudes. So we have two altitudes: the altitude from A is x=5, and the altitude from B is y=(3/4)x. Therefore, their intersection H is at x=5, y=(3/4)*5=15/4=3.75. So H=(5, 15/4). Let me verify this.Wait, altitude from A is x=5 (vertical line). Altitude from B is y=3/4 x. So intersection is at x=5, y=3/4*5=15/4=3.75. So H=(5, 15/4). Correct. Let me check if this lies on another altitude. Let&#39;s take altitude from C to AB.Compute the altitude from C to AB. First, equation of AB: points A(5,12) and B(0,0). Slope of AB is (12-0)/(5-0)=12/5. Therefore, the altitude from C is perpendicular to AB, so slope is -5/12.Equation of altitude from C(14,0): passes through C(14,0) with slope -5/12.Equation: y -0 = (-5/12)(x -14). So y= (-5/12)x +70/12= (-5/12)x +35/6.Now, check if H=(5,15/4) lies on this line.Plug x=5: y= (-5/12)*5 +35/6= (-25/12) +35/6= (-25/12 +70/12)=45/12=15/4. Yes, exactly. So H=(5,15/4) is on all three altitudes. Great, so orthocenter is correctly found.So H=(5,15/4). Let me note that down.Next, need to find point D, which is where AH intersects Γ (the circumcircle) again. So AH is the line from A(5,12) to H(5,15/4). Wait, since both points have x=5, that&#39;s a vertical line x=5. So D is the other intersection of x=5 with Γ.So we need to find the circumcircle Γ of triangle ABC. Let&#39;s find the equation of Γ.First, to find the circumcircle, we can use the coordinates of A, B, C. Let&#39;s compute the circumcircle equation.General equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0.Plug in points A(5,12), B(0,0), C(14,0).For B(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 + F=0 =&gt; F=0.For C(14,0): 196 +0 +14D +0 +0=0 =&gt;14D= -196 =&gt; D= -14.For A(5,12): 25 +144 +5D +12E +F=0 =&gt;169 +5*(-14) +12E=0 =&gt;169 -70 +12E=0 =&gt;99 +12E=0 =&gt;12E= -99 =&gt;E= -99/12= -33/4.Thus, equation of Γ: x² + y² -14x - (33/4)y =0. Multiply through by 4 to eliminate fractions: 4x² +4y² -56x -33y=0. But perhaps better to keep in standard form.Alternatively, write in standard form by completing the squares.Starting with x² -14x + y² - (33/4)y =0.Complete the square for x: x² -14x = (x -7)^2 -49.For y: y² - (33/4)y = (y - 33/8)^2 - (33/8)^2.Thus, equation becomes:(x -7)^2 -49 + (y - 33/8)^2 - (1089/64) =0So (x -7)^2 + (y - 33/8)^2 =49 +1089/64Compute 49 as 3136/64, so total right-hand side: (3136 +1089)/64=4225/64.Therefore, the circumcircle Γ has center at (7, 33/8) and radius sqrt(4225/64)=65/8=8.125.So center coordinates (7, 33/8), radius 65/8.Now, line AH is x=5. We need to find the other intersection point D of x=5 with Γ, besides A(5,12).Plug x=5 into the equation of Γ:(5 -7)^2 + (y - 33/8)^2 = (65/8)^2Compute left-hand side:(-2)^2 + (y - 33/8)^2 =4 + (y - 33/8)^2Set equal to (65/8)^2=4225/64.Thus:4 + (y -33/8)^2 =4225/64Subtract 4:(y -33/8)^2 =4225/64 -256/64= (4225 -256)/64=3969/64Take square root:y -33/8= ±63/8So y=33/8 ±63/8.Thus, y=(33+63)/8=96/8=12, which is point A(5,12), and y=(33-63)/8= -30/8= -15/4.Therefore, point D is (5, -15/4).So D=(5, -15/4). Got that.Next, need to find BH intersecting AC at F and Γ at G (other than B). Let&#39;s parse that.First, BH is the line from B(0,0) to H(5,15/4). Let me find the equation of BH.Coordinates of B(0,0) and H(5,15/4). The slope is (15/4 -0)/(5 -0)= (15/4)/5= 3/4.So equation of BH is y= (3/4)x. Wait, same as the altitude from B. Makes sense, since H lies on that altitude.So BH is the line y=(3/4)x.We need to find where BH intersects AC: that is point F. Wait, BH is the altitude from B, which we already found intersects AC at (224/25,168/25). Wait, but earlier we calculated the foot of the altitude from B as (224/25,168/25). However, BH is the entire altitude, which goes from B(0,0) to H(5,15/4). But in the problem statement, it says &quot;BH intersects AC at F&quot;. Wait, but in our calculation, BH is the altitude from B, so it intersects AC at the foot of the altitude, which is (224/25,168/25). Therefore, point F is (224/25,168/25). Let me confirm.Equation of BH is y=(3/4)x. Equation of AC is y=(-4/3)x +56/3. Their intersection is found by solving:(3/4)x = (-4/3)x +56/3Multiply both sides by 12:9x = -16x +22425x=224 =&gt;x=224/25=8.96, as before. Then y=(3/4)*(224/25)= 168/25=6.72. So yes, point F=(224/25,168/25). So F is (224/25,168/25). Let me note that.Next, point G is where BH intersects Γ again, other than B. So BH is the line y=(3/4)x. Find its other intersection with Γ.We need to solve the system:y=(3/4)xand(x -7)^2 + (y -33/8)^2 = (65/8)^2Substitute y= (3/4)x into the circle equation.So (x -7)^2 + ( (3x/4) -33/8 )^2 = 4225/64Let me compute each term.First, (x -7)^2 =x² -14x +49Second term: ( (3x/4) -33/8 )^2. Let&#39;s write 3x/4 as 6x/8, so:(6x/8 -33/8)^2 = ( (6x -33)/8 )^2 = (6x -33)^2 /64So expanding (6x -33)^2 =36x² - 396x + 1089Therefore, second term is (36x² -396x +1089)/64Thus, entire equation:x² -14x +49 + (36x² -396x +1089)/64 =4225/64Multiply all terms by 64 to eliminate denominators:64x² - 896x + 3136 +36x² -396x +1089 =4225Combine like terms:(64x² +36x²) + (-896x -396x) + (3136 +1089) =4225100x² -1292x +4225 =4225Subtract 4225 from both sides:100x² -1292x =0Factor:x(100x -1292)=0Solutions: x=0, which is point B(0,0), and x=1292/100=323/25=12.92Therefore, x=323/25, then y=(3/4)*(323/25)= (969)/100=9.69Thus, point G=(323/25, 969/100). Let me write that as fractions:323/25 =12 +23/25, 969/100=9 +69/100.So G=(323/25,969/100)Now, need to find where DG intersects AC at X. Let&#39;s find the equation of line DG.Points D(5, -15/4) and G(323/25,969/100). Let me convert these to fractions for easier calculation.D=(5, -15/4) = (125/25, -375/100)G=(323/25,969/100)So coordinates:D: (125/25, -375/100)G: (323/25,969/100)Compute the slope of DG:Slope m = (y_G - y_D)/(x_G - x_D) = [969/100 - (-375/100)] / [323/25 -125/25] = [ (969 +375)/100 ] / [198/25 ]= (1344/100)/(198/25)= (1344/100)*(25/198)= (1344*25)/(100*198)Simplify:1344/100=336/25Thus, (336/25)*(25/198)=336/198= (336 ÷ 6)/(198 ÷6)=56/33Thus, slope m=56/33.Equation of DG: Using point D(5, -15/4).y - (-15/4) = (56/33)(x -5)So y +15/4 = (56/33)(x -5)We need to find where this intersects AC. The equation of AC is y= (-4/3)x +56/3.Set equations equal:(56/33)(x -5) -15/4 = (-4/3)x +56/3Let me solve for x.First, expand the left-hand side:(56/33)x - (280/33) -15/4 = (-4/3)x +56/3Multiply all terms by the least common multiple of denominators 33,4,3. LCM of 33 and 4 is 132. So LCM=132.Multiply each term by 132:132*(56/33)x -132*(280/33) -132*(15/4) =132*(-4/3)x +132*(56/3)Simplify each term:132*(56/33)x =4*56 x=224x132*(280/33)=4*280=1120132*(15/4)=33*15=495132*(-4/3)x= -44*4x= -176x132*(56/3)=44*56=2464So equation becomes:224x -1120 -495 = -176x +2464Combine left-hand side:224x -1615 = -176x +2464Bring all terms to left:224x +176x -1615 -2464 =0400x -4079=0 =&gt;400x=4079 =&gt;x=4079/400=10.1975So x=4079/400. Let me keep it as a fraction: 4079/400.Then y= (-4/3)x +56/3= (-4/3)*(4079/400) +56/3Compute:= (-4079/300) +56/3= (-4079/300) +5600/300= (5600 -4079)/300=1521/300=507/100=5.07Thus, point X=(4079/400,507/100). Let me confirm these fractions.Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation. Let me check:Wait, equation steps:After multiplying by 132:Left side: 224x -1120 -495Right side: -176x +2464So bringing all terms to left:224x -1120 -495 +176x -2464=0Wait, no, original equation after multiplying:224x -1120 -495 = -176x +2464So to bring terms to left:224x -1120 -495 +176x -2464 =0Wait, that&#39;s not correct. Wait, equation is:224x -1615 = -176x +2464Add 176x to both sides:224x +176x -1615=2464400x -1615=2464Add 1615 to both sides:400x=2464+1615=4079Thus, x=4079/400. Correct. Then y= (-4/3)*(4079/400) +56/3Compute:First, (-4/3)*(4079/400)= (-4079)/30056/3=5600/300So sum: (-4079 +5600)/300=1521/300=507/100. Correct. So X=(4079/400,507/100). So that&#39;s point X.So now, quadrilateral HDXF. Need coordinates of H, D, X, F.Coordinates:H=(5,15/4)=(5, 3.75)D=(5, -15/4)=(5, -3.75)X=(4079/400,507/100)=(approx 10.1975,5.07)F=(224/25,168/25)=(approx8.96,6.72)Wait, but coordinates are exact fractions. Let me note all points as fractions:H=(5,15/4)D=(5,-15/4)F=(224/25,168/25)X=(4079/400,507/100)To compute the area of quadrilateral HDXF, perhaps we can use the shoelace formula. But since the coordinates are fractions, this might get messy, but let&#39;s try.First, order the points in a cyclic order. Let&#39;s choose H, D, X, F.But need to ensure the order is either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Let me visualize:H is at (5,3.75), D is at (5,-3.75), X is at ~10.2,5.07, F is at ~8.96,6.72.So H is on top, D is below on the same vertical line. X is to the right, above D, F is to the left of X but higher.So the quadrilateral is H(5,3.75) -&gt; D(5,-3.75)-&gt; X(10.1975,5.07)-&gt; F(8.96,6.72) -&gt; back to H. Let&#39;s check if this is the correct order.Alternatively, maybe H, F, X, D? Let me plot approximately:Plotting H at (5,3.75), D at (5,-3.75), F at (8.96,6.72), X at (10.1975,5.07). So quadrilateral HDXF connects H to D, then to X, then to F, then back to H. But need to ensure the polygon is simple (non-intersecting). Alternatively, maybe order H, F, X, D. Let me check.Alternatively, to apply shoelace, the order should be sequential around the perimeter. Let&#39;s use the order H, D, X, F.But perhaps better to check using coordinates:Let me list the coordinates:H: (5,15/4)=(5,3.75)D: (5,-15/4)=(5,-3.75)X: (4079/400,507/100)=(10.1975,5.07)F: (224/25,168/25)=(8.96,6.72)So plotting these:From H(5,3.75) down to D(5,-3.75), then to X(10.1975,5.07), then to F(8.96,6.72), back to H. This should form a quadrilateral without crossing. Let me confirm.From D(5,-3.75) to X(10.1975,5.07): moving right and up.From X to F(8.96,6.72): moving left and up.From F to H(5,3.75): moving left and down.Seems okay. Alternatively, maybe H, F, X, D is another order, but probably the given order is okay. Let&#39;s proceed with H, D, X, F.So coordinates in order:1. H: (5, 15/4)2. D: (5, -15/4)3. X: (4079/400, 507/100)4. F: (224/25, 168/25)Apply shoelace formula:Area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|Where (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1)Compute each term:Term 1: x1 y2 - x2 y1 =5*(-15/4) -5*(15/4)= (-75/4) -75/4= -150/4= -37.5Term 2: x2 y3 - x3 y2 =5*(507/100) - (4079/400)*(-15/4)Compute:First part:5*(507/100)=2535/100=50.7Second part: -(4079/400)*(-15/4)= (4079*15)/(400*4)= (61185)/1600≈38.240625So total term2=50.7 +38.240625≈88.940625But exact value:2535/100 +61185/1600= Convert to common denominator 1600:2535/100= (2535*16)/1600=40560/160061185/1600=61185/1600Sum=40560+61185=101,745 /1600=101745/1600=20349/320≈63.590625. Wait, wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, Term2: x2 y3 - x3 y2 =5*(507/100) - (4079/400)*(-15/4)Compute each part:5*(507/100)= (5*507)/100=2535/100=507/20(4079/400)*(-15/4)= -(4079*15)/(400*4)= -61185/1600But since it&#39;s x2 y3 - x3 y2, it&#39;s 5*(507/100) - (4079/400)*(-15/4)=507/20 + (4079*15)/(1600)Compute:507/20= (507*80)/1600=40560/1600(4079*15)/1600=61185/1600Sum=40560+61185=101745/1600=101745 ÷1600=63.590625So Term2=63.590625Term3: x3 y4 -x4 y3= (4079/400)*(168/25) - (224/25)*(507/100)Compute:First part: (4079/400)*(168/25)= (4079*168)/(400*25)= (4079*42)/(2500)= Let&#39;s compute 4079*42:4079*40=163,1604079*2=8,158Total=163,160+8,158=171,318Thus, 171,318 /2500=68.5272Second part: (224/25)*(507/100)= (224*507)/(25*100)= (113,  224*507: Let&#39;s compute 224*500=112,000 and 224*7=1,568. Total=112,000+1,568=113,568. Thus, 113,568 /2500=45.4272Therefore, Term3=68.5272 -45.4272=23.1But exact fractions:First part: (4079*168)/(400*25)=4079*168/(10,000)= Let&#39;s compute 4079*168:Compute 4000*168=672,00079*168=13, 272Wait, 79*100=7,900; 79*60=4,740; 79*8=632. So total=7,900+4,740=12,640+632=13,272Thus total 4079*168=672,000 +13,272=685,272Thus, 685,272 /10,000=68.5272Second part:224/25 *507/100= (224*507)/2500=113,568 /2500=45.4272Thus, Term3=68.5272 -45.4272=23.1 exactly? Wait, 68.5272-45.4272=23.1 exactly. So Term3=23.1=231/10.Term4: x4 y1 -x1 y4= (224/25)*(15/4) -5*(168/25)Compute:First part: (224/25)*(15/4)= (224*15)/(25*4)=3360/100=33.6Second part:5*(168/25)=840/25=33.6Thus, Term4=33.6 -33.6=0Sum all terms:Term1: -37.5Term2:63.590625Term3:23.1Term4:0Total sum= -37.5 +63.590625 +23.1= (-37.5 +63.590625)=26.090625 +23.1=49.190625Area=1/2 * |49.190625|=24.5953125So approximately 24.595. Thus, the greatest integer less than or equal to this area is 24.But wait, is this correct? Let me check calculations again, as this seems a bit straightforward, but given the problem&#39;s complexity, maybe I made a mistake.Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the order of the points. Let me try another order. Suppose the correct order is H, F, X, D.Let me recalculate with this order:Points:1. H(5,15/4)2. F(224/25,168/25)3. X(4079/400,507/100)4. D(5,-15/4)Then back to H(5,15/4)Compute shoelace terms:Term1: x1 y2 -x2 y1=5*(168/25) - (224/25)*(15/4)Compute:5*(168/25)=840/25=33.6(224/25)*(15/4)= (224*15)/(25*4)=3360/100=33.6Thus, Term1=33.6 -33.6=0Term2: x2 y3 -x3 y2= (224/25)*(507/100) - (4079/400)*(168/25)Compute:First part:224/25*507/100= (224*507)/(25*100)=113,568/2500=45.4272Second part:4079/400*168/25= (4079*168)/(400*25)= same as before=68.5272Thus, Term2=45.4272 -68.5272= -23.1Term3:x3 y4 -x4 y3= (4079/400)*(-15/4) -5*(507/100)Compute:First part:4079/400*(-15/4)= -61185/1600≈-38.240625Second part:5*(507/100)=2535/100=25.35Thus, Term3= -38.240625 -25.35= -63.590625Term4:x4 y1 -x1 y4=5*(15/4) -5*(-15/4)=75/4 +75/4=150/4=37.5Sum all terms:Term1:0Term2:-23.1Term3:-63.590625Term4:37.5Total sum=0 -23.1 -63.590625 +37.5= (-86.690625) +37.5= -49.190625Area=1/2 * | -49.190625 | =24.5953125 same as before. So regardless of the order, the area is the same. So the area is 24.595..., so the greatest integer less than or equal is 24.But wait, the problem says &quot;Compute the greatest integer less than or equal to the area of quadrilateral HDXF.&quot;But my calculation gives approximately 24.595, so floor is 24. However, I need to check if the exact area is slightly higher than 24.595 due to fractions, but 24.595 is already with decimal approximations.Wait, let&#39;s compute the exact value of the area. Let&#39;s go back to the shoelace formula using fractions.Original sum when ordered H, D, X, F:Term1:5*(-15/4) -5*(15/4)= -75/4 -75/4= -150/4= -75/2Term2:5*(507/100) - (4079/400)*(-15/4)= (2535/100) + (61185/1600)Convert to common denominator 1600:2535/100= (2535*16)/1600=40,560/160061185/1600=61,185/1600Sum=40,560+61,185=101,745/1600Term2=101,745/1600Term3:(4079/400)*(168/25) - (224/25)*(507/100)= as before:(4079*168)/(400*25) - (224*507)/(25*100)= (685,272)/(10,000) - (113,568)/(2,500)= (685,272 - 454,272)/10,000= (231,000)/10,000=231/10=23.1=231/10Term4: (224/25)*(15/4) -5*(168/25)= (3,360)/(100) - (840)/25=33.6 -33.6=0So total sum:-75/2 +101,745/1600 +231/10 +0Convert all to fractions over 1600:-75/2= (-75*800)/1600= -60,000/1600101,745/1600 remains same231/10= (231*160)/1600=36,960/1600So total sum:(-60,000 +101,745 +36,960)/1600= (101,745 +36,960 -60,000)/1600= (138,705 -60,000)/1600=78,705/1600Thus, area=1/2 * |78,705/1600|=78,705/(3200)=78,705 ÷3200.Compute division:3200*24=76,80078,705 -76,800=1,905Thus, 24 +1,905/3200≈24.5953125Yes, exactly as before. So area is 78705/3200=15741/640≈24.5953125Therefore, the greatest integer less than or equal is 24.But wait, I should check once again if the shoelace order was correct. Because sometimes the order might result in a negative area, but we take the absolute value, so it&#39;s okay. Also, the two different orderings gave the same absolute value. So seems correct.But let me think if the problem might have some symmetries or properties that can be used to compute the area without coordinates. For example, maybe using properties of orthocenter, cyclic quadrilaterals, etc. But given that we&#39;ve already computed via coordinates and got approximately 24.595, which floors to 24, perhaps that&#39;s the answer.But before finalizing, let me verify with another approach.Alternative approach: Use vectors or area decomposition.Alternatively, since H is the orthocenter, maybe use properties of orthocenters and reflections. But not sure.Alternatively, consider that HDXF is a quadrilateral whose area can be computed by splitting into triangles.For instance, HDXF can be divided into triangles HDF and DFX, but need to check if that&#39;s valid.Alternatively, compute areas of triangles HDX and HXF and sum them.But perhaps messy. Alternatively, use coordinates as we did, which is straightforward.Given that the exact area is 15741/640≈24.595, floor is 24. Hence, the answer is 24.But let me cross-verify with approximate coordinates.Compute approximate coordinates:H=(5,3.75)D=(5,-3.75)X≈(10.1975,5.07)F≈(8.96,6.72)Compute the area using shoelace with approximate decimals:List the coordinates in order H(5,3.75), D(5,-3.75), X(10.1975,5.07), F(8.96,6.72), back to H.Compute shoelace sum:Term1:5*(-3.75) -5*3.75= -18.75 -18.75= -37.5Term2:5*5.07 -10.1975*(-3.75)=25.35 +38.240625≈63.590625Term3:10.1975*6.72 -8.96*5.07≈(10.1975*6.72)=68.56; (8.96*5.07)≈45.43; difference≈23.13Term4:8.96*3.75 -5*6.72≈33.6 -33.6=0Sum≈-37.5 +63.590625 +23.13 +0≈49.220625Area≈49.220625/2≈24.610, which is ≈24.61, so floor still 24. So same result.Thus, confident that the answer is 24.Final Answerboxed{24}</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>✅:</span>To solve the problem, we start by determining the coordinates of triangle (ABC) with sides (AB = 13), (BC = 14), and (CA = 15). Using coordinate geometry, we place (B) at ((0, 0)), (C) at ((14, 0)), and find (A) at ((5, 12)) using the distance formula.Next, we find the orthocenter (H) of (triangle ABC). The orthocenter is the intersection of the altitudes. The altitude from (A) to (BC) is the vertical line (x = 5), and the altitude from (B) to (AC) has the equation (y = frac{3}{4}x). Solving these equations, we find (H) at ((5, frac{15}{4})).We then determine the coordinates of point (D), where line (AH) intersects the circumcircle (Gamma) again. The circumcircle of (triangle ABC) has center ((7, frac{33}{8})) and radius (frac{65}{8}). Solving the intersection of the vertical line (x = 5) with the circumcircle, we find (D) at ((5, -frac{15}{4})).Next, we find point (F), where (BH) intersects (AC). Solving the equations of (BH) and (AC), we find (F) at ((frac{224}{25}, frac{168}{25})). Point (G), where (BH) intersects the circumcircle again, is found by solving the intersection of (BH) with (Gamma), resulting in (G) at ((frac{323}{25}, frac{969}{100})).To find point (X), where (DG) intersects (AC), we solve the equations of (DG) and (AC). The coordinates of (X) are found to be ((frac{4079}{400}, frac{507}{100})).Using the shoelace formula to compute the area of quadrilateral (HDXF) with vertices (H(5, frac{15}{4})), (D(5, -frac{15}{4})), (X(frac{4079}{400}, frac{507}{100})), and (F(frac{224}{25}, frac{168}{25})), we find the area to be approximately (24.595).

Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts.First, a nilpotent matrix is a matrix where some power of it is the zero matrix. So if a matrix is nilpotent, there exists some positive integer k such that A^k = O. The problem says that not all of these matrices are nilpotent. So at least one of them is not nilpotent. That means for that particular matrix, no matter how high a power you take, you never get the zero matrix. The goal is to show that there exists some k &gt; 0 such that when you take each A_i to the k-th power and sum them up, the result isn&#39;t the zero matrix. So even though some of them might be nilpotent, since at least one isn&#39;t, there should be a k where the non-nilpotent one&#39;s power doesn&#39;t cancel out the others. Let me think. If all matrices except one are nilpotent, then the non-nilpotent one&#39;s powers will eventually (for some k) not be zero, and since the others might become zero for large enough k, their sum would just be the non-nilpotent one&#39;s power, which isn&#39;t zero. But what if there are multiple non-nilpotent matrices? Then even if some of them cancel each other out for certain k, we need to find a k where their sum isn&#39;t zero. Wait, but how can matrices cancel each other out? If we&#39;re working over the real numbers, matrices can have entries that are positive or negative. So even if each A_i^k is non-zero, their sum might still be zero if they are negatives of each other. But the problem states that not all are nilpotent. So at least one matrix is non-nilpotent, but others could be non-nilpotent as well. But maybe over the real numbers, if a matrix isn&#39;t nilpotent, then its powers can&#39;t all be traceless or something? Wait, the trace of a nilpotent matrix is zero because all eigenvalues are zero. So if a matrix is not nilpotent, its trace is not zero, or at least not all powers have trace zero. But trace is linear, so the trace of the sum is the sum of the traces. So if we take the trace of the sum of the k-th powers, that&#39;s the sum of the traces of each A_i^k. If we can show that for some k, the sum of the traces is non-zero, then the sum of the matrices can&#39;t be the zero matrix, since the trace of the zero matrix is zero. That&#39;s a good approach. So maybe we can consider the trace. Let me formalize this. Let’s denote S_k = A₁^k + A₂^k + ... + Aₘ^k. We need to show that there exists k &gt; 0 such that S_k ≠ O_n. If we can show that trace(S_k) ≠ 0 for some k, then S_k ≠ O_n. Because the trace of the zero matrix is 0, so if trace(S_k) ≠ 0, then S_k can&#39;t be the zero matrix. So, trace(S_k) = trace(A₁^k) + trace(A₂^k) + ... + trace(Aₘ^k). Now, for a nilpotent matrix, say A_i, all its eigenvalues are 0, so trace(A_i^k) = 0 for all k ≥ 1. For a non-nilpotent matrix, since it&#39;s not nilpotent, it has at least one non-zero eigenvalue. Wait, but over the real numbers, eigenvalues can be complex. However, the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues (with multiplicity), and for real matrices, complex eigenvalues come in conjugate pairs. So even if there are complex eigenvalues, their contributions to the trace (which is real) would still be the sum of the real parts. But if a matrix isn&#39;t nilpotent, then it must have at least one eigenvalue that&#39;s not zero. Let&#39;s say λ is a non-zero eigenvalue of A_i. Then trace(A_i^k) would be the sum of the k-th powers of its eigenvalues. If λ ≠ 0, then λ^k isn&#39;t zero for any k, but depending on λ, it might approach zero as k increases if |λ| &lt; 1, but since we&#39;re working over real numbers and λ could be complex, but trace is real. Wait, but even if some eigenvalues are complex, their k-th powers would come in conjugate pairs, so their sum would be real. For example, if you have eigenvalues re^{iθ} and re^{-iθ}, their k-th powers are r^k e^{i kθ} and r^k e^{-i kθ}, which add up to 2 r^k cos(kθ), which is real. So the trace of A_i^k is a real number, which is the sum of all eigenvalues raised to the k-th power. Since A_i is not nilpotent, there exists at least one eigenvalue λ ≠ 0. Therefore, trace(A_i^k) is the sum of λ_j^k where λ_j are the eigenvalues of A_i, and at least one λ_j ≠ 0. So trace(A_i^k) is not identically zero as a function of k. Therefore, for each non-nilpotent A_i, the sequence trace(A_i^k) is not identically zero. Now, we have m matrices, at least one of which is non-nilpotent. So the sum of their traces, trace(S_k), is the sum over i=1 to m of trace(A_i^k). Since for the nilpotent matrices, their traces are zero for all k, so the sum reduces to the sum over the non-nilpotent matrices of trace(A_i^k). So if we can show that there exists a k such that this sum is non-zero, then we are done. Let&#39;s assume that among the m matrices, there are t non-nilpotent matrices, 1 ≤ t ≤ m. Let&#39;s denote these non-nilpotent matrices as B₁, B₂, ..., B_t. Then, trace(S_k) = trace(B₁^k) + ... + trace(B_t^k). We need to show that this sum is not zero for some k. Suppose, for contradiction, that for all k &gt; 0, the sum of the traces of the B_i^k is zero. Then, for each k, sum_{i=1}^t trace(B_i^k) = 0. But can such a situation happen? If the traces of all powers of the matrices sum to zero, does that force some kind of contradiction? Maybe using generating functions or considering the properties of the eigenvalues. Let me think about the eigenvalues. For each non-nilpotent matrix B_i, let’s denote its non-zero eigenvalues as λ_{i1}, λ_{i2}, ..., λ_{in} (some of these could be complex, but as mentioned before, they come in conjugate pairs). Then trace(B_i^k) = λ_{i1}^k + λ_{i2}^k + ... + λ_{in}^k. Therefore, the sum trace(S_k) = sum_{i=1}^t sum_{j=1}^{n} λ_{ij}^k. If this sum is zero for all k, then we have sum_{i,j} λ_{ij}^k = 0 for all k ≥ 1. This is similar to the concept in linear algebra where if you have a set of complex numbers such that their powers sum to zero for all k, then they must all be zero. But here, we have a finite set of eigenvalues (since each matrix is n x n, so each has at most n eigenvalues, counting algebraic multiplicities), and their k-th powers sum to zero for all k. Wait, but if we have a finite set of non-zero complex numbers λ_1, λ_2, ..., λ_s such that for all k ≥ 1, sum_{i=1}^s λ_i^k = 0, then this would imply that all λ_i are zero. But we know that at least one λ_i is non-zero (since there is at least one non-nilpotent matrix, which has at least one non-zero eigenvalue). Therefore, if we can show that such a sum cannot be zero for all k unless all λ_i are zero, which would contradict the existence of non-nilpotent matrices, then we can conclude that there must exist some k where the sum is non-zero. This seems like a standard result. Let me recall: if we have distinct non-zero complex numbers μ_1, ..., μ_r, and coefficients c_1, ..., c_r not all zero, then the function f(k) = c_1 μ_1^k + ... + c_r μ_r^k cannot be zero for all k. In fact, even if it&#39;s zero for infinitely many k, then all c_i must be zero. This is related to the linear independence of exponential functions. But in our case, the sum is sum_{i,j} λ_{ij}^k = 0 for all k. If we treat each λ_{ij} as a root, then we can use the fact that if a linear combination of exponentials (in k) is zero for all k, then all the coefficients must be zero. However, in our case, the coefficients are all 1 (since each term is λ_{ij}^k). Wait, but in our problem, the sum is sum_{i,j} λ_{ij}^k = 0 for all k ≥ 1. Wait, but if we have different λ&#39;s, then how can their k-th powers sum to zero for all k? For example, suppose you have two numbers a and b such that a^k + b^k = 0 for all k. Then for k=1, a + b = 0, so b = -a. Then for k=2, a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + (-a)^2 = 2a^2 = 0 ⇒ a=0. So the only solution is a = b = 0. Similarly, if you have more numbers, the same idea applies. Suppose you have three numbers a, b, c. If a^k + b^k + c^k = 0 for all k, then similarly, considering different k&#39;s would force all of them to be zero. Therefore, if sum_{i,j} λ_{ij}^k = 0 for all k ≥ 1, then each λ_{ij} must be zero. But this contradicts the fact that we have at least one non-zero λ_{ij} (since there&#39;s at least one non-nilpotent matrix). Therefore, our assumption that the sum is zero for all k is false. Hence, there must exist some k for which the sum is non-zero. Therefore, trace(S_k) ≠ 0 for some k, which implies S_k ≠ O_n. So such a k exists. Wait, but I need to make sure that this reasoning is rigorous. Let me formalize it a bit. Suppose, for contradiction, that for all k ≥ 1, sum_{i=1}^m A_i^k = O_n. Then taking the trace on both sides, we get sum_{i=1}^m trace(A_i^k) = 0 for all k ≥ 1. But as we established, the trace of a nilpotent matrix is zero for all k, so this reduces to sum_{non-nilpotent A_i} trace(A_i^k) = 0 for all k ≥ 1. For each non-nilpotent A_i, trace(A_i^k) is the sum of the k-th powers of its eigenvalues. Let’s denote all the non-zero eigenvalues across all non-nilpotent matrices as μ_1, μ_2, ..., μ_s (with possible repetitions due to multiple matrices and multiplicities). Then, the equation becomes sum_{j=1}^s μ_j^k = 0 for all k ≥ 1. We need to show that this implies all μ_j = 0, which contradicts the existence of non-nilpotent matrices. To prove this, consider the power sums. If sum_{j=1}^s μ_j^k = 0 for all k ≥ 1, then by Newton&#39;s identities, all elementary symmetric sums of the μ_j must be zero, which would imply that all μ_j are zero. Alternatively, consider generating functions. Let’s define the generating function G(x) = sum_{k=1}^infty (sum_{j=1}^s μ_j^k) x^k. If sum_{j=1}^s μ_j^k = 0 for all k ≥ 1, then G(x) = 0. But G(x) can also be written as sum_{j=1}^s sum_{k=1}^infty (μ_j x)^k = sum_{j=1}^s (μ_j x)/(1 - μ_j x). If this is identically zero, then each coefficient must be zero, which requires μ_j = 0 for all j. Therefore, the only way the sum of the k-th powers of the eigenvalues is zero for all k is if all eigenvalues are zero, which contradicts the presence of non-nilpotent matrices. Hence, our assumption that the sum is zero for all k is false. Therefore, there must exist some k for which the sum is non-zero, meaning S_k ≠ O_n. Therefore, the required integer k exists. Another angle: suppose all non-nilpotent matrices have some non-zero eigenvalues. If we take k to be large enough, the dominant eigenvalues (those with the largest modulus) will dictate the behavior of trace(A_i^k). If there&#39;s a unique dominant eigenvalue among all the non-nilpotent matrices, then as k increases, the term with that eigenvalue&#39;s k-th power will dominate, making the sum of traces non-zero. However, if there are multiple eigenvalues with the same maximal modulus, they could potentially cancel each other out for some k, but not for all k. For example, suppose two eigenvalues λ and -λ. Then for even k, λ^k + (-λ)^k = 2λ^k ≠ 0, and for odd k, it&#39;s 0. So in this case, there are some k where the sum is non-zero. Therefore, even if eigenvalues cancel for certain k, they can&#39;t cancel for all k. Therefore, in any case, there must exist some k where the sum of traces is non-zero, hence the sum of the matrices is non-zero. So, wrapping up, the key idea is that the trace of the sum is the sum of traces, which reduces to the sum of traces of non-nilpotent matrices. The traces are sums of eigenvalues&#39; k-th powers. If all such sums were zero for every k, it would force all eigenvalues to be zero, contradicting non-nilpotency. Therefore, there must be some k where the trace is non-zero, hence the matrix sum is non-zero.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>✅:</span>To demonstrate that there exists an integer ( k &gt; 0 ) such that ( A_1^k + A_2^k + cdots + A_m^k neq O_n ), we analyze the traces of the matrices&#39; powers.1. Trace Analysis: For any matrix ( A ), the trace ( text{tr}(A^k) ) equals the sum of its eigenvalues raised to the ( k )-th power. Nilpotent matrices have all eigenvalues zero, so their trace is zero for all ( k ). Non-nilpotent matrices have at least one non-zero eigenvalue.2. Sum of Traces: Let ( S_k = A_1^k + A_2^k + cdots + A_m^k ). The trace ( text{tr}(S_k) ) is the sum of traces of each ( A_i^k ). Since nilpotent contributions vanish, ( text{tr}(S_k) = sum_{text{non-nilpotent } A_i} text{tr}(A_i^k) ).3. Non-Zero Eigenvalues: For non-nilpotent ( A_i ), let ( {lambda_j} ) be their non-zero eigenvalues (possibly complex). Then ( text{tr}(A_i^k) = sum lambda_j^k ). The total trace becomes ( sum_{text{non-nilp.}} sum lambda_j^k ).4. Contradiction via Power Sums: Assume ( text{tr}(S_k) = 0 ) for all ( k ). This implies ( sum lambda_j^k = 0 ) for all ( k ).

We need to find all nonnegative integers a and b such that 4^a + 2^b + 5 is a perfect square. Then, sum all possible a + b and give that total. Hmm, sounds interesting. Let&#39;s start by breaking down the problem.First, let&#39;s recall that 4^a is the same as (2^2)^a, which simplifies to 2^(2a). So, the expression becomes 2^(2a) + 2^b + 5. Our goal is to find when this sum is a perfect square. Let&#39;s denote this expression as N^2, where N is some nonnegative integer. So, we have:2^(2a) + 2^b + 5 = N^2Since a and b are nonnegative integers, they can be 0, 1, 2, etc. Let&#39;s consider different values of a and b and see when the expression becomes a perfect square.But before jumping into testing values, maybe we can find some patterns or constraints to narrow down the possibilities. Let&#39;s think about the possible sizes of the terms. 4^a grows exponentially with a, same with 2^b, but 4^a grows faster. The constant term is 5, which is small. So perhaps for larger a or b, the total becomes too big to be a perfect square? Or maybe not? Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, we can consider modulo properties. For example, perfect squares modulo some number can only take certain residues. Let&#39;s try modulo 4. Since 4^a is 0 mod 4 when a ≥ 1, but 4^0 = 1 mod 4. Similarly, 2^b mod 4: when b ≥ 2, 2^b is 0 mod 4; when b = 1, it&#39;s 2 mod 4; and when b = 0, it&#39;s 1 mod 4. The constant 5 is 1 mod 4. So, let&#39;s compute the expression mod 4 for different cases.Case 1: a = 0. Then 4^0 = 1. So the expression becomes 1 + 2^b + 5 = 6 + 2^b. Let&#39;s compute this mod 4. 6 mod 4 is 2. Then 2^b mod 4:- If b = 0: 1 ⇒ 2 + 1 = 3 mod 4. But squares mod 4 are 0 or 1. So 3 mod 4 can&#39;t be a square. So no solution here.- If b = 1: 2 ⇒ 2 + 2 = 4 ≡ 0 mod 4. Possible, since squares can be 0 mod 4.- If b ≥ 2: 2^b ≡ 0 mod 4 ⇒ 2 + 0 = 2 mod 4. But again, squares mod 4 are 0 or 1. So 2 mod 4 is invalid. So when a=0, only possible b is 1.So for a=0, possible b=1. Let&#39;s check:Expression: 4^0 + 2^1 + 5 = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8. 8 is not a perfect square. Wait, so even though mod 4 worked, the actual value isn&#39;t a square. Hmm. So even though modulo condition is necessary, it&#39;s not sufficient. So even when the residue is 0 mod 4, the number might not be a square. So that case doesn&#39;t work. So a=0, b=1 gives 8, not a square. Hence, no solution for a=0.Wait, but 8 is not a square. So even though the modulo suggested it might be possible, it isn&#39;t. So we need to check actual values even if modulo allows it.Case 2: a ≥ 1. Then 4^a ≡ 0 mod 4. So the expression becomes 0 + 2^b + 5. So 2^b + 5 mod 4.Let&#39;s compute 2^b mod 4 again:- b=0: 1 ⇒ 1 + 5 = 6 ≡ 2 mod 4. Not a square.- b=1: 2 ⇒ 2 + 5 = 7 ≡ 3 mod 4. Not a square.- b ≥ 2: 0 ⇒ 0 + 5 = 5 ≡ 1 mod 4. Squares can be 1 mod 4. So possible.Therefore, for a ≥ 1, b must be ≥ 2. So now, for a ≥ 1 and b ≥ 2, the expression is 4^a + 2^b + 5. Let&#39;s denote this as N^2.So, 4^a + 2^b + 5 = N^2.We can think of 4^a as (2^a)^2, so maybe write it as:(2^a)^2 + 2^b + 5 = N^2This looks a bit like a Pythagorean triplet, but with an extra 2^b. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe we can bound N^2 between (2^a)^2 and (2^a + k)^2 for some k. Let&#39;s see.For fixed a, 4^a is a square. Let&#39;s consider how much 2^b + 5 adds to it. Since 2^b can be as big as needed, but we need the total to be a square. For each a, perhaps we can find b such that N^2 - (2^a)^2 = 2^b + 5. Let&#39;s denote that as:N^2 - (2^a)^2 = 2^b + 5Factor the left-hand side as a difference of squares:(N - 2^a)(N + 2^a) = 2^b + 5Now, since N &gt; 2^a (because the right-hand side is positive), both (N - 2^a) and (N + 2^a) are positive integers. Also, note that (N - 2^a) and (N + 2^a) are factors of 2^b + 5. Furthermore, since (N + 2^a) - (N - 2^a) = 2^(a+1), the difference between the two factors is 2^(a+1).So we have two factors of 2^b + 5, say d1 and d2, such that d1 * d2 = 2^b + 5 and d2 - d1 = 2^(a+1). Since 2^b + 5 is a number that is 5 more than a power of 2. Let&#39;s note that 2^b + 5 is odd when b ≥ 2 (since 2^b is even and 5 is odd). So d1 and d2 must both be odd, and their product is 2^b + 5. Also, since their difference is 2^(a+1), which is a power of 2. So two odd numbers differing by a power of 2.But two odd numbers differing by a power of 2. For example, if the difference is 2^k, then the numbers are d1 and d1 + 2^k. Their product is 2^b + 5.Given that d1 * (d1 + 2^(a+1)) = 2^b + 5.So we can set up the equation:d1^2 + 2^(a+1) * d1 - (2^b + 5) = 0This is a quadratic in d1. But perhaps this approach is too complicated. Alternatively, since 2^b + 5 is not a very large number for small b, maybe we can find possible factorizations.Alternatively, note that since d1 and d2 are factors of 2^b + 5 and their difference is 2^(a+1), which is a power of 2. So perhaps we can list possible factor pairs of 2^b + 5 and check if their difference is a power of 2.But 2^b + 5 can be factored in very limited ways since it&#39;s of the form even + 5, which for b ≥ 2 is odd. So 2^b + 5 is odd, hence its factors are all odd. So possible factor pairs (d1, d2) where d1 ≤ d2 and d1 * d2 = 2^b + 5. Then check if d2 - d1 = 2^(a+1). If so, then we can find a from the exponent.Given that 2^b + 5 is the product of two factors differing by 2^(a+1). Since 2^b + 5 is not a very large number for small b, we can try small b values and see if this is possible.Let&#39;s try small b ≥ 2:Start with b = 2:2^2 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9. So factors of 9: 1*9, 3*3. The possible differences:9 - 1 = 8, which is 2^3. So if d2 - d1 = 8, then a+1 = 3 ⇒ a = 2. Let&#39;s check:d1 = 1, d2 = 9. Then from the equation N - 2^a = 1 and N + 2^a = 9. Adding these: 2N = 10 ⇒ N = 5. Subtracting: 2^(a+1) = 8 ⇒ a+1 = 3 ⇒ a=2. So yes, a=2, b=2. Let&#39;s check the original expression: 4^2 + 2^2 +5 = 16 +4 +5=25=5^2. Correct. So (a,b)=(2,2) is a solution. Then a + b = 4.Next, for b=2, another factor pair is 3*3, but difference is 0, which would mean 2^(a+1)=0, impossible. So only one solution here.Next, b=3:2^3 +5=8+5=13. 13 is prime. Factors are 1*13. Difference 12, which is 12. 12 is not a power of 2. So no solution here.b=4:2^4 +5=16 +5=21. Factors:1*21, 3*7. Differences:21-1=20, not a power of 2. 7-3=4, which is 2^2. So if difference is 4, then 2^(a+1)=4 ⇒ a+1=2 ⇒ a=1. Check:d1=3, d2=7. Then N -2^a=3 and N +2^a=7. Adding: 2N=10 ⇒ N=5. Subtracting: 2*2^a=4 ⇒ 2^a=2 ⇒ a=1. So yes, a=1. Then check original expression:4^1 +2^4 +5=4+16+5=25=5^2. Correct. So (a,b)=(1,4). Then a + b=5.Another factor pair for 21:1*21. Difference 20, not a power of 2. So only one solution here.b=5:2^5 +5=32+5=37. Prime. Factors 1*37. Difference 36, not a power of 2. No solution.b=6:2^6 +5=64+5=69. Factors:1*69, 3*23. Differences:69-1=68, not power of 2. 23-3=20, not power of 2. No solution.b=7:2^7 +5=128+5=133. Factors:1*133,7*19. Differences:132,12. Neither are powers of 2. No solution.b=8:2^8 +5=256 +5=261. Factors:1*261, 3*87, 9*29. Differences:260,84,20. None are powers of 2. No solution.b=9:2^9 +5=512+5=517. Factors:1*517,11*47. Differences:516,36. Not powers of 2.b=10:2^10 +5=1024 +5=1029. Let&#39;s factor 1029. Divide by 3: 1029/3=343. So 3*343=3*7^3. Factors:1*1029, 3*343, 7*147, 21*49. Differences:1028, 340, 140, 28. 28 is not a power of 2 (16, 32), 340, etc. No.Hmm, seems like as b increases, 2^b +5 becomes large and its factors don&#39;t differ by a power of 2. Maybe up to certain b, but let&#39;s check b=4 and a=1 which worked. What about other values?Wait, perhaps we need to check for more a values. So far, we found solutions when (a,b)=(2,2) and (1,4). Let&#39;s see if there are others.But maybe there are more solutions for higher a and b? Let&#39;s test some more a values.Alternatively, for a given a, we can compute 4^a +5, and then see if 2^b = N^2 -4^a -5. Since 2^b must be nonnegative, N^2 must be at least 4^a +5. Let&#39;s fix a and try to find N and b.Let&#39;s try a=1:4^1 +5=4+5=9. So expression is 9 +2^b. So 9 +2^b is a square. So N^2 -9=2^b. So N^2 -9 must be a power of 2. Let&#39;s find N such that N^2 -9 is a power of 2.Possible N: Let&#39;s try N=4: 16-9=7. Not power of 2.N=5:25-9=16=2^4. So b=4. That&#39;s the solution we found earlier.N=3:9-9=0=2^0. So 2^b=0. But b must be nonnegative integer, 2^b=0 has no solution. So only N=5 works. Hence, a=1, b=4 is the only solution.For a=2:4^2 +5=16+5=21. So 21 +2^b is a square. So N^2 -21=2^b. Find N such that N^2 -21 is a power of 2.N=5:25-21=4=2^2. So b=2. That&#39;s the solution we found.N=6:36-21=15. Not a power of 2.N=7:49-21=28. Not a power of 2.N=4:16-21=-5. Negative. So only N=5 works. Hence, a=2, b=2.a=3:4^3 +5=64+5=69. So N^2 -69=2^b. Let&#39;s see:N=8:64-69=-5. No.N=9:81-69=12. Not power of 2.N=10:100-69=31. Not power of 2.N=11:121-69=52. No.N=12:144-69=75. No.N=13:169-69=100=2^2*5^2. Not a power of 2.Continuing up:N=14:196-69=127. Prime, not power of 2.N=15:225-69=156. Not power of 2.N=16:256-69=187. Not power of 2.So no solutions here.a=4:4^4 +5=256+5=261. N^2 -261=2^b.N=16:256-261=-5.N=17:289-261=28. Not power of 2.N=18:324-261=63. Not power of 2.N=19:361-261=100. Not power of 2.N=20:400-261=139. Prime.Similarly, higher N will get larger differences, which are unlikely to be powers of 2. So no solution here.a=5:4^5 +5=1024+5=1029. N^2 -1029=2^b.N=32:1024-1029=-5.N=33:1089-1029=60. No.N=34:1156-1029=127. Prime.N=35:1225-1029=196=14^2. Not power of 2.N=36:1296-1029=267. No.So no solution.a=6:4^6 +5=4096+5=4101. N^2 -4101=2^b.N=64:4096-4101=-5.N=65:4225-4101=124. Not power of 2.N=66:4356-4101=255=3*5*17. Not power of 2.Similarly, no solution.It seems like as a increases beyond 2, 4^a +5 becomes too large for 2^b to make up the difference to the next square. Maybe there&#39;s a point where it&#39;s impossible, but we can check a few more.a=0: We checked earlier, but let&#39;s see again. 4^0 +5=1+5=6. So 6 +2^b=N^2. Possible N:N=3:9-6=3. Not power of 2.N=4:16-6=10. No.N=5:25-6=19. No.N=2:4-6=-2. No.So no solution for a=0.a=1: Only solution at b=4.a=2: Only solution at b=2.What about a=3? We tried, nothing.Maybe check a=1, b=5:4 +32 +5=41. Not a square.a=1, b=3:4 +8 +5=17. Not a square.Wait, maybe there are other solutions where a and b are larger? Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose we consider that N^2 -2^(2a) =2^b +5. So for fixed a, N needs to be slightly larger than 2^a. Let&#39;s let N=2^a +k, where k is a positive integer. Then:N^2 = (2^a +k)^2 =4^a +2^(a+1)k +k^2.Therefore, N^2 -4^a=2^(a+1)k +k^2=2^b +5.So, 2^(a+1)k +k^2=2^b +5.Since the left-hand side is 2^(a+1)k +k^2, which must equal 2^b +5. Note that 2^b +5 is either even or odd depending on b, but for b ≥1, it&#39;s odd when b=0, but b≥2, 2^b is divisible by 4, so 2^b +5 is 5 mod 4, which is 1 mod 4. Wait, no. For b≥2, 2^b is 0 mod4, so 0 +5=5 mod4=1 mod4. So the left-hand side, 2^(a+1)k +k^2, must be ≡1 mod4.Let&#39;s see:2^(a+1)k mod4: If a+1 ≥2, i.e., a≥1, then 2^(a+1) is 0 mod4, so 2^(a+1)k ≡0 mod4. Then k^2 mod4: k is an integer. If k is even, k^2≡0 mod4; if k is odd, k^2≡1 mod4. Therefore, total LHS mod4:If k even: 0 +0=0 mod4. But RHS is 1 mod4. Doesn&#39;t match.If k odd: 0 +1=1 mod4. Which matches RHS. Therefore, k must be odd.Therefore, k must be odd.So, for a ≥1, k is odd. Let&#39;s set k=2m+1 for m≥0.Then:2^(a+1)(2m+1) + (2m+1)^2 =2^b +5.Let&#39;s expand:2^(a+1)*(2m) +2^(a+1) +4m^2 +4m +1=2^b +5.Simplify:2^(a+2)*m +2^(a+1) +4m^2 +4m +1=2^b +5.Combine constants:2^(a+2)*m +4m^2 +4m +2^(a+1) +1 -5=2^b.So,4m^2 +4m +2^(a+2)*m +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.This seems complicated, but maybe for small m and a, we can find solutions.Let&#39;s try m=0 (k=1):Then equation becomes:0 +0 +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.So,2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Factor:2^2*(2^(a-1) -1)=2^b.Therefore, 2^(a-1) -1=2^(b-2).Since left-hand side is 2^(a-1) -1 and right-hand side is 2^(b-2). So we have:2^(a-1) -1=2^(b-2)Let’s denote x = a -1 and y = b -2, so x ≥0 (since a ≥1), y ≥0 (since b ≥2).Then:2^x -1=2^y.Looking for nonnegative integers x,y such that 2^x -1=2^y.Solutions: Let&#39;s see:If x=1: 2 -1=1=2^0. So y=0. Then a-1=1 ⇒ a=2, b-2=0 ⇒b=2. Which is the solution we found earlier: a=2, b=2.x=2:4 -1=3. Not a power of 2.x=3:8 -1=7. No.x=4:16 -1=15. No.Similarly, higher x will result in 2^x -1 being odd numbers greater than 1 but not powers of 2. So only x=1 gives a solution. Hence, m=0 gives us the solution a=2, b=2.Now, let&#39;s try m=1 (k=3):Plugging into the equation:4*(1)^2 +4*1 +2^(a+2)*1 +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Compute:4 +4 +2^(a+2) +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Simplify:4 +4 -4 +2^(a+2) +2^(a+1)=2^b.So,4 +2^(a+2) +2^(a+1)=2^b.Factor 2^(a+1):4 +2^(a+1)(2 +1)=4 +3*2^(a+1)=2^b.So,3*2^(a+1) +4=2^b.We need to find nonnegative integers a,b such that 3*2^(a+1) +4=2^b.Let’s rearrange:2^b -3*2^(a+1)=4.Factor out 2^(a+1):2^(a+1)(2^{b - (a+1)} -3)=4.Since 4=2^2, and 2^(a+1) divides 4, possible values of a+1 are 0,1,2. But a+1≥1 (since a≥1). So a+1=1 or 2.Case 1: a+1=1 ⇒a=0. But a≥1, so invalid.Case 2: a+1=2 ⇒a=1. Then:2^(1+1)(2^{b -2} -3)=4 ⇒4*(2^{b-2} -3)=4 ⇒2^{b-2} -3=1 ⇒2^{b-2}=4 ⇒b-2=2 ⇒b=4.So we get a=1, b=4. Which is the other solution we found earlier.Therefore, m=1 gives us a=1, b=4.Now, let&#39;s try m=2 (k=5):Plug into the equation:4*(2)^2 +4*2 +2^(a+2)*2 +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Compute:4*4=16; 4*2=8; 2^(a+2)*2=2^(a+3); 2^(a+1); -4.So total:16 +8 +2^(a+3) +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Simplify:16 +8 -4=20; and 2^(a+3) +2^(a+1)=2^(a+1)(4 +1)=5*2^(a+1).So,5*2^(a+1) +20=2^b.Factor:5*(2^(a+1) +4)=2^b.But 5 is odd, so 2^b must be divisible by 5, which implies b=0 and 2^b=1, but 5*(something)=1 impossible. So no solution here.Similarly, for m=3 (k=7):This will get even more complicated. Let&#39;s check m=3:Equation becomes:4*9 +4*3 +2^(a+2)*3 +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Compute:36 +12 +3*2^(a+2) +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Simplify:36 +12 -4=44; 3*2^(a+2)=3*4*2^a=12*2^a; and 2^(a+1)=2*2^a.So:12*2^a +2*2^a +44=14*2^a +44=2^b.Factor:14*2^a +44=2^b.We can factor out 2:2*(7*2^(a-1) +22)=2^b.So,7*2^(a-1) +22=2^{b-1}.But 7*2^(a-1) +22 must be a power of 2. Let&#39;s check possible a:Start with a=1:7*2^(0) +22=7+22=29. Not a power of 2.a=2:7*2 +22=14+22=36. Not a power of 2.a=3:7*4 +22=28+22=50. No.a=4:7*8 +22=56+22=78. No.a=5:7*16 +22=112+22=134. No.Similarly, increasing a makes the term larger, not a power of 2. So no solution here.It seems that for m≥2, the equations don&#39;t yield solutions. So maybe only m=0 and m=1 give solutions, which correspond to the two solutions we found earlier.To confirm, let&#39;s try m=4 (k=9):Equation becomes:4*16 +4*4 +2^(a+2)*4 +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Compute:64 +16 +4*2^(a+2) +2^(a+1) -4=2^b.Simplify:64 +16 -4=76; 4*2^(a+2)=16*2^a; 2^(a+1)=2*2^a.Total:16*2^a +2*2^a +76=18*2^a +76=2^b.Factor out 2:2*(9*2^(a-1) +38)=2^b.So,9*2^(a-1) +38=2^{b-1}.Again, check possible a:a=1:9*1 +38=47. Not power of 2.a=2:9*2 +38=18+38=56. No.a=3:9*4 +38=36+38=74. No.a=4:9*8 +38=72+38=110. No.a=5:9*16 +38=144+38=182. No.Same issue.Thus, it seems that only m=0 and m=1 give valid solutions, corresponding to the two pairs we found: (2,2) and (1,4).But let&#39;s make sure there are no other solutions for higher a and b. Suppose we take a=3 and b= some larger value. Let&#39;s see:For example, a=3, b=5:4^3 +2^5 +5=64+32+5=101. Not a square.a=3, b=6:64+64+5=133. Not a square.a=3, b=4:64+16+5=85. Not a square.a=4, b=3:256+8+5=269. Not a square.a=4, b=4:256+16+5=277. Not a square.a=4, b=5:256+32+5=293. Not a square.Similarly, a=5, b=5:1024+32+5=1061. Not a square.It seems like no other solutions exist.Wait, what about a=1 and b=6?4 +64 +5=73. Not a square.a=1 and b=5:4 +32 +5=41. Not a square.a=2 and b=3:16 +8 +5=29. Not a square.a=2 and b=4:16 +16 +5=37. Not a square.a=2 and b=5:16 +32 +5=53. Not a square.a=2 and b=1:16 +2 +5=23. Not a square. But b=1 would give mod4=3, which isn&#39;t allowed for a≥1. So no.Another approach: Let&#39;s consider that 4^a +2^b +5=N^2. Suppose N is close to 2^a. Let&#39;s write N=2^a +k. Then:(2^a +k)^2=4^a +2^(a+1)k +k^2=4^a +2^b +5.Thus, 2^(a+1)k +k^2=2^b +5.We did this earlier. So for small k, which is what we want because N is close to 2^a.We already saw that k=1 and k=3 give solutions. Let&#39;s try k=5:2^(a+1)*5 +25=2^b +5.So,5*2^(a+1) +20=2^b.Which is similar to what we had before. For example, a=1:5*4 +20=20 +20=40=2^3 *5. Not a power of 2.a=2:5*8 +20=40 +20=60. No.a=3:5*16 +20=80 +20=100=2^2*5^2. Not power of 2.No solution.k=2:But earlier we saw that k must be odd. So even k won&#39;t work because LHS would be even + even, but mod4 wouldn&#39;t match. So k must be odd.k=5: tried.k=7:2^(a+1)*7 +49=2^b +5.So,7*2^(a+1) +44=2^b.Again, check for small a:a=1:7*4 +44=28 +44=72=8*9. Not a power of 2.a=2:7*8 +44=56 +44=100=2^2*5^2. No.a=3:7*16 +44=112 +44=156. No.Same issue.Thus, no solutions for larger k.Therefore, it&#39;s plausible that the only solutions are (a,b)=(1,4) and (2,2). Hence, their sums a + b are 5 and 4, so total sum is 5 +4=9.But wait, the problem says &quot;the sum of all possible sums a + b&quot;. So if there are multiple (a,b) pairs, we need to sum all their a + b. In this case, two pairs: 1+4=5 and 2+2=4. Total sum is 5 +4=9.But wait, let me double-check if there are any other solutions.Wait, earlier when we considered a=0, we saw that for a=0, b=1 gives 8, which is not a square. What about a=0, b=0:1 +1 +5=7. Not square. a=0, b=2:1 +4 +5=10. Not square. a=0, b=3:1 +8 +5=14. Not square. a=0, b=4:1 +16 +5=22. Not square. So no solutions for a=0.Similarly, for a=3 and b=7:64 +128 +5=197. Not square. a=3, b=8:64 +256 +5=325. Not square. a=3, b=9:64 +512 +5=581. Not square. So nothing.Another angle: Suppose we consider that 2^b must be N^2 -4^a -5. So N^2 must be greater than 4^a +5. Let&#39;s assume that N=2^a +k where k is small. As we saw, k=1 and k=3 gave solutions. For larger k, maybe not.Alternatively, if we consider the equation 4^a +2^b +5=N^2. Let&#39;s fix b and see if there are solutions.For example, b=2:Then expression is 4^a +4 +5=4^a +9. So we need 4^a +9 to be a square.Check a=2:16 +9=25=5^2. Yes. So a=2, b=2.a=0:1 +9=10. Not square.a=1:4 +9=13. Not square.a=3:64 +9=73. No.So only a=2 works for b=2.For b=4:Expression is 4^a +16 +5=4^a +21. So need 4^a +21 is a square.a=1:4 +21=25=5^2. Yes.a=2:16 +21=37. No.a=3:64 +21=85. No.So only a=1 works for b=4.For b=5:4^a +32 +5=4^a +37. Check a=3:64 +37=101. No.a=4:256 +37=293. No. Not squares.Similarly, no solutions.For b=6:4^a +64 +5=4^a +69.a=2:16 +69=85. No.a=3:64 +69=133. No.a=4:256 +69=325. No.No solutions.For b=7:4^a +128 +5=4^a +133.a=3:64 +133=197. No.a=4:256 +133=389. No.Not squares.b=8:4^a +256 +5=4^a +261.a=4:256 +261=517. No.a=5:1024 +261=1285. No.Nothing.So indeed, only b=2 and b=4 yield solutions for certain a&#39;s.Therefore, the only pairs (a,b) are (2,2) and (1,4). Thus, the sums a + b are 4 and 5. Therefore, the total sum is 4 +5=9.Final Answerboxed{9}</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>✅:</span>To find the sum of all possible sums (a + b) where (a) and (b) are nonnegative integers such that (4^a + 2^b + 5) is a perfect square, we start by analyzing the equation:[4^a + 2^b + 5 = N^2]where (N) is a nonnegative integer. We consider different values of (a) and (b) and check if the expression results in a perfect square.1. Case (a = 0):   - The expression simplifies to (1 + 2^b + 5 = 6 + 2^b).   - Checking modulo 4, we find no valid solutions for (a = 0).2. Case (a geq 1):   - For (a geq 1), (4^a equiv 0 mod 4), so we need (2^b + 5 equiv 1 mod 4). This implies (b geq 2).   - We analyze the equation (4^a + 2^b + 5 = N^2) for different values of (a) and (b):     - For (a = 1), we find (4 + 2^b + 5 = N^2). Checking values of (b), we find (b = 4) gives (4 + 16 + 5 = 25 = 5^2). Thus, ((a, b) = (1, 4)).     - For (a = 2), we find (16 + 2^b + 5 = N^2). Checking values of (b), we find (b = 2) gives (16 + 4 + 5 = 25 = 5^2). Thus, ((a, b) = (2, 2)).3. Other values of (a) and (b):   - Checking higher values of (a) and (b) using modular arithmetic and factorization methods, we find no additional solutions.The valid pairs ((a, b)) are ((1, 4)) and ((2, 2)). Their sums are (1 + 4 = 5) and (2 + 2 = 4). Summing these results:[5 + 4 = 9]Thus, the sum of all possible sums (a + b) is:[boxed{9}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>🔑:</span>To find the sum of all possible sums (a + b) where (a) and (b) are nonnegative integers such that (4^a + 2^b + 5) is a perfect square, we need to analyze the equation (4^a + 2^b + 5 = x^2) for integer solutions.1. Rewrite the equation:   [   4^a + 2^b + 5 = x^2   ]   Since (4^a = 2^{2a}), we can rewrite the equation as:   [   2^{2a} + 2^b + 5 = x^2   ]2. Consider the case (a &gt; 1) and (b &gt; 2):   If (a &gt; 1) and (b &gt; 2), we can analyze the equation modulo 8:   [   2^{2a} + 2^b + 5 equiv 0 pmod{8}   ]   Since (2^{2a} equiv 0 pmod{8}) for (a geq 1) and (2^b equiv 0 pmod{8}) for (b geq 3), we have:   [   0 + 0 + 5 equiv 5 pmod{8}   ]   This is not congruent to 0 modulo 8, so there are no solutions for (a &gt; 1) and (b &gt; 2).3.

The only solution is (a = 2) and (x = 5):     [     4^2 = (5-3)(5+3) implies 16 = 2 cdot 8     ]     Thus, (a = 2) and (b = 2).   - Case (b = 1):     [     4^a + 2 + 5 = x^2 implies 4^a + 7 = x^2     ]     This can be written as:     [     4^a = (x-3)(x+3)     ]     There are no solutions in modulo 3, as (4^a equiv 1 pmod{3}) and (7 equiv 1 pmod{3}), but (x^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}) does not hold.   - Case (a = 1):     [     4 + 2^b + 5 = x^2 implies 2^b + 9 = x^2     ]     This can be written as:     [     2^b = (x-3)(x+3)     ]     For (2^b) to be a product of two factors differing by 6, we need (x-3) and (x+3) to be powers of 2. The only solution is (b = 4) and (x = 5):     [     2^4 = (5-3)(5+3) implies 16 = 2 cdot 8     ]     Thus, (a = 1) and (b = 4).   - Case (a = 0):     [     1 + 2^b + 5 = x^2 implies 2^b + 6 = x^2     ]     If (b) is an odd number, there is no solution. If (b) is an even number, say (b = 2k), we can write:     [     2^b = (x-2^k)(x+2^k)     ]     Trying different values, we find no solutions.   - Case (b = 0):     [     4^a + 1 + 5 = x^2 implies 4^a + 6 = x^2     ]     This is similar to the case (a = 0) and has no solutions.4. Summarize the solutions:   We have two solutions:   [   (a, b) = (2, 2) quad text{and} quad (a, b) = (1, 4)   ]   Therefore, the possible sums (a + b) are:   [   2 + 2 = 4 quad text{and} quad 1 + 4 = 5   ]5. Sum of all possible sums:   [   4 + 5 = 9   ]The final answer is (boxed{9})</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-d9c3ddfb data-v-6400c8a0><div class="review" data-v-6400c8a0><div class="review-title" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>❓:</span> k  marbles are placed onto the cells of a  2024 times 2024  grid such that each cell has at most one marble and there are no two marbles are placed onto two neighboring cells (neighboring cells are defined as cells having an edge in common).a) Assume that  k=2024 .

There are two parts, a) and b). Let me start with part a). The question says that we need to place 2024 marbles such that each cell has at most one marble, no two marbles are in neighboring cells, and moving any marble to any neighboring cell would result in an arrangement that violates the conditions. So, after moving, either two marbles become neighbors, or maybe the marble is moved to a cell that already has a marble. First, let me visualize the grid. A 2024x2024 grid is a huge chessboard-like grid. For such problems, often a checkerboard pattern is useful, where you color the grid alternately black and white. In such a pattern, no two cells of the same color are adjacent. So if you place marbles on all black cells, no two marbles are adjacent. But of course, that would be way more than 2024 marbles. Since the grid has 2024x2024 cells, half of them would be black, so about (2024^2)/2 marbles. But here k is just 2024, which is much smaller. So maybe a different approach is needed.The key here is that after placing the marbles, moving any single marble to any neighboring cell would cause a conflict. So each marble must be &quot;blocked&quot; in all four directions (if possible). That is, for each marble, all its neighboring cells must be either occupied by another marble or at the edge of the grid. Wait, but if all neighbors are occupied, then that would mean the marbles are packed tightly, but since we can&#39;t have two marbles adjacent, the only way a marble&#39;s neighbor is occupied is if it&#39;s on the edge. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, if a marble is on the edge of the grid, some of its neighbors are outside the grid, so those are automatically &quot;blocked&quot;. So perhaps placing marbles along the edges in such a way that their other neighbors are also occupied? Wait, but marbles can&#39;t be adjacent. So maybe if we place marbles in such a way that every marble is adjacent to the edge or has a marble diagonally next to it?Wait, let&#39;s think again. The condition is that moving any marble to any neighboring cell would break the rules. So for each marble, all four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) must either have a marble or be such that moving the marble there would create a conflict. But since marbles can&#39;t be adjacent, moving a marble to a neighboring cell would only create a conflict if that cell is adjacent to another marble. But if all neighboring cells of the original marble are already adjacent to other marbles, then moving the marble there would place it next to another marble. Wait, but if the neighboring cells are already adjacent to marbles, then the original marbles must be arranged so that each marble is surrounded by cells that are adjacent to other marbles. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe an example with a smaller grid would help, but the grid here is 2024x2024, which is even-sized.Alternatively, perhaps arranging the marbles in a diagonal pattern. Let&#39;s say we place a marble in cell (1,1), then skip a cell, then another marble in (1,3), and so on. But then, moving a marble from (1,1) to (1,2) would create an adjacent marble with (1,3). Wait, but if we place marbles every other cell in a row, then moving a marble to an adjacent cell would indeed create adjacency. But in that case, the original arrangement would already have marbles spaced with one cell apart. But in such a case, the marbles are not adjacent, but moving one could create adjacency. However, the problem states that after moving any marble, the new arrangement does not satisfy both conditions. The two conditions are: each cell has at most one marble, and no two marbles are neighboring. So moving a marble to a neighboring cell could either put it into a cell that already has a marble (violating the first condition) or make it adjacent to another marble (violating the second condition). So, in order for the movement to be invalid, either the target cell is already occupied, or the target cell is adjacent to another marble.Therefore, for the original arrangement to satisfy that moving any marble to any neighbor would result in a conflict, each marble must have all its neighboring cells either occupied or adjacent to another marble. Wait, but adjacent to another marble? If a neighboring cell is adjacent to another marble, then moving the original marble there would make it adjacent to that other marble.Wait, let me clarify. Let&#39;s say we have a marble at position (i,j). The neighboring cells are (i±1,j) and (i,j±1). For each of these four cells, either:1. The cell is already occupied by another marble. Then moving the marble to that cell would result in two marbles in the same cell, which violates the first condition.2. The cell is unoccupied but adjacent to another marble. Then moving the marble to that cell would result in two marbles being adjacent, violating the second condition.3. The cell is unoccupied and not adjacent to any marble. Then moving the marble there would be possible without violating the conditions, which we don&#39;t want.Therefore, to satisfy the problem&#39;s requirement, for every marble, all four neighboring cells must be either occupied or adjacent to another marble.But how do we arrange marbles such that this is true?Alternatively, if we can arrange marbles in such a way that every empty cell is adjacent to at least one marble. Then, moving any marble to an adjacent cell would either land on an occupied cell or an empty cell that is adjacent to another marble (which would make two marbles adjacent). Wait, but if every empty cell is adjacent to at least one marble, then moving a marble to an empty cell would place it next to another marble, violating the second condition. However, the original marbles are placed such that no two are adjacent.This seems similar to the concept of a &quot;dominating set&quot; in graph theory, where every vertex is either in the set or adjacent to a vertex in the set. Here, if we have a dominating set of marbles, then every empty cell is adjacent to a marble. Then, moving a marble to any adjacent cell (which is either in the dominating set or adjacent to it) would result in either overlapping or adjacency. But a dominating set on a grid graph where no two marbles are adjacent? That&#39;s called an independent dominating set. So we need an independent dominating set of size 2024 on a 2024x2024 grid. Is that possible? And is the size 2024 achievable?In a grid graph, the minimum independent dominating set is a known problem. For an n x n grid, the size of the minimum independent dominating set is roughly n^2/2 for even n, but that seems too large. Wait, maybe not. Wait, an independent set can be half the grid cells if we use the checkerboard pattern, but a dominating set needs every cell to be either in the set or adjacent to it. In the checkerboard pattern, every white cell is adjacent to black cells and vice versa. So if we take all black cells as an independent dominating set, then every white cell is adjacent to a black cell. But the size is n^2/2. For 2024x2024, that would be about 2024*2024/2, which is way more than 2024. So that&#39;s not helpful here.But the problem requires k=2024 marbles. So how can we have a much smaller independent dominating set? For a grid, the independent dominating set problem is known to be NP-hard, but perhaps for specific grid structures, there&#39;s a pattern. However, given the grid is even-sized, maybe there&#39;s a way to arrange marbles in a line or diagonal such that each marble dominates a certain area.Alternatively, placing marbles along the main diagonal. Let&#39;s consider that. If we place a marble on each cell (i,i) for i from 1 to 2024. Then, each marble is on the diagonal, no two marbles are adjacent (since they are spaced one cell apart diagonally, but horizontally and vertically, they are two cells apart). Wait, actually, on the main diagonal, the distance between consecutive marbles is sqrt(2) in grid terms, but in terms of adjacency, they are not adjacent since they share only a corner, not an edge. So that satisfies the non-adjacent condition. Now, does this arrangement dominate the grid? Each marble at (i,i) dominates its four neighbors: (i±1,i) and (i,i±1). However, for cells not adjacent to the diagonal, they might not be dominated. For example, cell (1,3) is not adjacent to any marble on the diagonal. So this doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, placing marbles in every other cell in a row, offset in the next row. Like a brick wall pattern. For example, in row 1, place marbles in columns 1,3,5,... Then in row 2, place marbles in columns 2,4,6,... etc. But again, this would give a large number of marbles, roughly half the grid, which is too much.Wait, but we need only 2024 marbles. Since the grid is 2024x2024, 2024 marbles is just one marble per row, or one per column. If we place one marble per row and column, like a permutation matrix. In a permutation matrix, each row and column has exactly one marble, placed at a position (i, σ(i)) where σ is a permutation. In such a case, marbles are not adjacent since no two are in the same row or column, and the permutation ensures they are not diagonally adjacent either. But does a permutation matrix of size 2024x2024 have the property that moving any marble to a neighboring cell would violate the conditions?Let&#39;s see. Take a marble at (i, σ(i)). Its neighbors are (i±1, σ(i)) and (i, σ(i)±1). If we move the marble to (i+1, σ(i)), then in the new arrangement, there would be a marble at (i+1, σ(i)). But in the original permutation matrix, the marble in row i+1 is at (i+1, σ(i+1)). So unless σ(i+1) = σ(i)±1, moving the marble down would not conflict with the existing marble. However, since σ is a permutation, σ(i+1) is not adjacent to σ(i) unless the permutation is specially designed. But in general, a permutation matrix does not have this property. For example, if σ is the identity permutation, then moving a marble from (i,i) to (i+1,i) would conflict with the marble at (i+1,i+1) only if i+1 is adjacent to i, which it&#39;s not. Wait, (i+1,i) is adjacent to (i+1,i+1) horizontally. So moving the marble from (i,i) to (i+1,i) would place it next to the marble at (i+1,i+1). Therefore, in the identity permutation, moving a marble down would place it adjacent to the marble in the next row. Similarly, moving it to the right would place it adjacent to the marble in the next column. Therefore, in this case, the permutation matrix (identity) would satisfy the condition that moving any marble down or right would result in adjacency. However, moving a marble up or left might not, because there&#39;s no marble above or to the left unless i=1 or j=1. Wait, for the first row, moving a marble up is impossible, and moving it left from column 1 is impossible. Similarly, for the last row and column.But in this case, the permutation matrix (identity) might actually satisfy part a)&#39;s conditions. Let me check. If we have marbles on the main diagonal, then each marble at (i,i). If we try to move a marble to any neighboring cell:- Moving (i,i) up to (i-1,i): If i &gt; 1, then (i-1,i) is adjacent to (i-1,i-1) if there&#39;s a marble there. Since in the identity permutation, (i-1,i-1) has a marble. So (i-1,i) is adjacent to (i-1,i-1), so moving the marble to (i-1,i) would place it next to (i-1,i-1). Similarly, moving down to (i+1,i) would be adjacent to (i+1,i+1). Moving left to (i,i-1) would be adjacent to (i-1,i-1). Moving right to (i,i+1) would be adjacent to (i+1,i+1). Therefore, every move of a marble to a neighboring cell would place it adjacent to another marble. Hence, this arrangement might satisfy part a)&#39;s conditions.But wait, in the identity permutation, each marble is at (i,i). The neighboring cells of (i,i) are (i±1,i) and (i,i±1). The cells (i+1,i) and (i,i+1) are adjacent to (i+1,i+1), which has a marble. Similarly, (i-1,i) is adjacent to (i-1,i-1), and (i,i-1) is adjacent to (i-1,i-1). Therefore, if we move the marble at (i,i) to any of its neighbors, the new cell would be adjacent to another marble, violating the second condition. Therefore, this arrangement satisfies the requirement. Moreover, the permutation matrix has exactly 2024 marbles, one per row and column, which matches k=2024. Also, no two marbles are adjacent since they are on the main diagonal with at least one cell apart in all directions.Therefore, this seems like a valid solution for part a). So the answer is to place the marbles along the main diagonal.But wait, let&#39;s verify with a small example. Take a 2x2 grid. Placing marbles on (1,1) and (2,2). Moving the (1,1) marble to (1,2) would place it adjacent to (2,2)? No, (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2) vertically. So yes, moving (1,1) to (1,2) would be adjacent to (2,2). Similarly, moving (1,1) to (2,1) would be adjacent to (2,2). Moving (2,2) to (2,1) would be adjacent to (1,1), and moving (2,2) to (1,2) would be adjacent to (1,1). So indeed, in the 2x2 case, the main diagonal placement works. Similarly, in a 3x3 grid, marbles at (1,1), (2,2), (3,3). Moving any marble to a neighbor would place it adjacent to another marble. For example, moving (2,2) to (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1), moving to (2,3) is adjacent to (3,3), etc. So this seems to hold.Therefore, for part a), placing the marbles along the main diagonal satisfies the conditions.Now, moving on to part b). We need to determine the largest value of k such that for all arrangements of k marbles satisfying the conditions (no two adjacent, each cell at most one marble), we can move one marble to a neighboring cell and still satisfy the conditions. So regardless of how you arrange k marbles, there exists at least one marble that can be moved to a neighboring cell without violating the two conditions.So part b) is asking for the maximum k where every possible arrangement of k marbles has at least one movable marble. This is equivalent to finding the maximal k such that the graph corresponding to the grid (with marbles as vertices) does not contain a &quot;blocking&quot; configuration where every marble is immobilized.This seems related to the concept of &quot;irredundance&quot; in graphs. The upper irredundance number might be relevant here, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, it&#39;s like finding the maximum k where every independent set of size k is non-maximal, meaning it can be extended or modified by moving a marble.But maybe a better approach is to think about the complement problem: what&#39;s the minimal k such that there exists an arrangement where no marble can be moved. Then the answer to part b) would be one less than that minimal k. But since part a) gives an example with k=2024 where you can&#39;t move any marbles, the minimal such k is at most 2024. But part b) asks for the largest k where all arrangements can have a marble moved. So if k=2024 is possible to have an immovable arrangement, then the maximal k for part b) is 2023? But that seems too simplistic. Probably, the answer is related to the size of a maximal independent set minus something.Wait, let&#39;s think differently. The grid graph is bipartite. Let&#39;s color it in checkerboard fashion: black and white cells. The maximum independent set is exactly half the number of cells, which is (2024^2)/2 = 2024*1012. But we&#39;re dealing with much smaller k here. The question is about the largest k such that every independent set of size k is not &quot;maximal&quot; in the sense that you can move a marble to a neighboring cell (which would be in the other color class) and still have an independent set.Wait, moving a marble from a black cell to a white cell (since neighboring cells are of the opposite color in a checkerboard). So if all marbles are on black cells, moving one to a white cell would require that the white cell is not adjacent to any other marbles. But since the original marbles are on black cells, the white cells adjacent to them are the neighboring cells. So if every white cell is adjacent to at most one marble, then you could move a marble to that white cell. Wait, but if a white cell is adjacent to multiple marbles, then moving a marble there would still be adjacent to the others. Hmm, no. Wait, if you move a marble from a black cell to a white cell, the new cell must not be adjacent to any other marbles. Since the original marbles are all on black cells, the white cell is adjacent only to the original black cell&#39;s neighbors. But if the white cell is adjacent to any other black cells with marbles, then moving the marble there would make it adjacent to those marbles.Therefore, in order to be able to move a marble from a black cell to a white cell, the white cell must be adjacent only to the original black cell and no others. That is, the white cell must have only one neighbor in the independent set. But if the independent set is such that every white cell has at most one black neighbor, then you can move marbles to those white cells. However, this is probably not the case for all independent sets.Alternatively, if we consider that in any independent set, if there&#39;s a marble that can be moved to an adjacent cell without conflicting, then the value of k is such that there&#39;s always such a marble. The question is to find the largest k where this is always true.This seems related to the concept of &quot;defenders&quot; in graphs. If every independent set of size k has at least one vertex that can be moved (repositioned) to another vertex while maintaining independence, then k is within this bound. Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of the independent set being non-frozen. A frozen independent set is one where no vertex can be moved (added or removed) while maintaining independence. Here, it&#39;s similar but with movement. To find the largest k such that every independent set of size k is non-frozen (in the sense that a marble can be moved). The answer is likely related to the size of the grid and the structure of independent sets.In a bipartite graph like the grid, the maximum independent set is large, but we are dealing with much smaller k. Let me consider small cases. For a 2x2 grid, the maximum independent set is 2 marbles. If k=2, placing marbles on (1,1) and (2,2), then you can&#39;t move either marble, similar to part a). So for 2x2, the answer would be 1, because if k=1, you can always move the single marble to any adjacent cell (unless it&#39;s in a corner, but even then, moving from corner to adjacent edge is possible without conflict). Wait, in a 2x2 grid, if k=1, say placed at (1,1). You can move it to (1,2), which is adjacent, but (1,2) is not adjacent to any other marbles (since there are none). So the new arrangement still satisfies the conditions. Therefore, for k=1, it&#39;s possible. But when k=2, you can&#39;t move any marbles. So the largest k where all arrangements can be moved is 1. But 2x2 is small.For a 3x3 grid, the maximum independent set is 5 (checkerboard pattern). Let&#39;s see. If k=5, in the checkerboard pattern, all marbles are on black cells. To move a marble, you have to move it to a white cell. But every white cell is adjacent to two or more black cells. For example, the center white cell is adjacent to four black cells. So moving any black marble to a white cell would place it adjacent to other marbles. Therefore, in the maximum independent set, you can&#39;t move any marbles. Therefore, the largest k for 3x3 would be 4. Is that true? Let&#39;s see. If k=4, can every arrangement of 4 marbles allow moving one? Suppose we have an independent set of 4 marbles. There must be at least one marble that can be moved. Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Suppose in 3x3, place marbles at (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3). This is a 4-marble independent set. Can we move any marble? Let&#39;s see. Each marble is at a corner. Moving a corner marble to an edge cell. For example, move (1,1) to (1,2). But (1,2) is adjacent to (1,3), which has a marble. So that&#39;s invalid. Similarly, moving (1,1) to (2,1) is adjacent to (3,1). So no, this arrangement can&#39;t move any marbles. So even with k=4 in 3x3, there exists an arrangement where you can&#39;t move any marbles. Therefore, the largest k might be lower.This suggests that the problem is more complex. Maybe the answer is related to the size of a matching or something else.Alternatively, let&#39;s think in terms of the grid&#39;s structure. For each marble, to be able to move it, there must be an adjacent cell that is empty and not adjacent to any other marbles. So, in other words, for at least one marble, one of its neighbors is empty, and that empty neighbor is not adjacent to any other marbles.Therefore, the problem reduces to ensuring that in any arrangement of k marbles, there exists at least one marble with an empty neighbor (let&#39;s call this cell A) such that cell A is not adjacent to any other marbles.So, to guarantee that, we need that k is not too large such that every possible arrangement has such a marble and such a cell.Conversely, the maximal k where this is not guaranteed is when there exists an arrangement where every empty cell is adjacent to at least two marbles. Then, moving any marble would require moving it to a cell adjacent to another marble.Wait, but if every empty cell is adjacent to at least one marble, then moving a marble to an empty cell would result in adjacency. So the threshold k is where the complement of the independent set is a dominating set. So when the empty cells form a dominating set, meaning every marble is adjacent to an empty cell. Wait, but if the empty cells are a dominating set, then every marble is adjacent to an empty cell. But we need that there exists an empty cell adjacent to a marble, which is not adjacent to any other marbles. This is getting complicated. Let&#39;s try a different approach. Suppose we model the grid as a graph where each cell is a vertex, and edges connect adjacent cells. An independent set S (marbles) is a set of vertices with no two adjacent. We need the largest k such that every independent set S of size k has at least one vertex v in S and a neighbor u of v not in S such that u is not adjacent to any other vertex in S.This is equivalent to saying that the independent set S is not &quot;1-dominating&quot; in the sense that every neighbor of S is adjacent to at least two vertices in S.To find the maximal k where every independent set of size k has such a vertex v and u.In graph theory terms, this is similar to saying that the independent set S is not a &quot;2-packing&quot; or something else, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, think about the maximum k such that the minimum number of &quot;movable&quot; marbles in any independent set of size k is at least one.To find this k, perhaps we can use the concept of the graph&#39;s toughness or other properties, but I don&#39;t know.Alternatively, consider that in order to block all marbles from being moved, every empty cell must be adjacent to at least two marbles. Because if an empty cell is adjacent to only one marble, then you can move that marble to the empty cell without conflicting with others. Therefore, if every empty cell is adjacent to at least two marbles, then no marble can be moved to any empty cell without creating a conflict. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of marbles needed such that every empty cell is adjacent to at least two marbles. Then, the maximal k for part b) would be one less than this minimal number.So let&#39;s calculate the minimal number of marbles needed to cover all empty cells with at least two marbles each. Wait, but marbles are placed on the grid such that no two are adjacent. So each marble can &quot;cover&quot; its four neighboring cells. To cover each empty cell with at least two marbles, each empty cell must have at least two marbles in its neighborhood.This is similar to a covering problem where each empty cell must be covered by at least two marbles, with marbles not adjacent to each other.This seems like a difficult problem, but perhaps we can estimate.Let’s denote the number of marbles as k. Each marble covers 4 cells (its neighbors), but each empty cell needs to be covered by at least two marbles. Therefore, the total coverage needed is at least 2*(2024^2 - k). Each marble contributes 4 to the coverage, but since marbles cannot be adjacent, each cell is adjacent to at most one marble. Wait, no. If marbles are not adjacent, then no cell is adjacent to more than one marble. Wait, if two marbles are adjacent to the same cell, they must be diagonal to each other, which is allowed. Wait, marbles can be diagonally adjacent, so a cell can have up to four marbles diagonally adjacent. But marbles cannot be orthogonally adjacent. So, for a given empty cell, the number of marbles adjacent to it (orthogonally) is the number of marbles placed in its four neighboring cells. Since marbles are not adjacent, these four cells cannot have marbles adjacent to each other. So, in the orthogonal neighbors of an empty cell, you can place at most two marbles (since placing a marble in, say, the left neighbor prevents the right neighbor from having a marble, and similarly for up and down). Wait, no. If an empty cell has four orthogonal neighbors, you can place marbles in any of them, provided they are not adjacent. For example, you could place marbles in the left and right neighbors, as long as those left and right cells are not adjacent to other marbles. But since the left and right cells are adjacent to the empty cell, they are not adjacent to each other. Similarly, up and down are not adjacent. Therefore, you can place marbles in all four orthogonal neighbors of an empty cell. Wait, no. The left and right neighbors are in the same row, separated by one cell (the empty cell). So marbles can be placed in both left and right neighbors, as they are not adjacent. Similarly, up and down neighbors are not adjacent. Therefore, in theory, you can place up to four marbles around an empty cell. However, since marbles cannot be adjacent, the maximum number of marbles adjacent to an empty cell is four (one in each direction). But if you have marbles in all four directions around an empty cell, those marbles are not adjacent to each other because they are separated by the empty cell.Therefore, it&#39;s possible for an empty cell to have four marbles adjacent to it. However, to cover each empty cell with at least two marbles, we need that each empty cell has at least two marbles in its four neighboring cells.So the total coverage required is at least 2*(2024^2 - k). Each marble provides 4 coverage (covers four cells). But since each coverage is counted per marble per cell, the total coverage is 4k. Therefore, we have 4k ≥ 2*(2024^2 - k). Solving for k:4k ≥ 2*2024^2 - 2k4k + 2k ≥ 2*2024^26k ≥ 2*2024^2k ≥ (2*2024^2)/6 = (2024^2)/3So the minimal number of marbles needed to cover each empty cell with at least two marbles is at least (2024^2)/3. Since k must be an integer, this gives a lower bound. However, this is probably not tight, because marbles cover multiple cells and there might be overlaps. But this suggests that the minimal k is roughly (2024^2)/3. However, this is way larger than 2024, which is the k from part a). But part a)&#39;s k=2024 allows an arrangement where you can&#39;t move any marbles, which would correspond to this covering number. But since (2024^2)/3 is about 2024*675, which is much larger than 2024, there&#39;s a discrepancy.Wait, this suggests that my approach is wrong. Because in part a), we have k=2024 which already blocks all moves, but according to the covering argument, the minimal k to block all moves is around 2024^2 /3, which is much larger. Therefore, my assumption that blocking all moves requires covering each empty cell with at least two marbles is incorrect.Wait, in part a), the example with marbles on the main diagonal blocks all moves because each empty cell adjacent to a marble is adjacent to another marble. Wait, no. In the main diagonal arrangement, each empty cell adjacent to a marble is adjacent to exactly one marble. For example, take cell (i,j) where j = i+1. This cell is adjacent to marble (i,i) and possibly (i+1,j) if j = i+1. Wait, no. If we have marbles on the main diagonal, then the cell to the right of a marble (i,i+1) is adjacent only to (i,i). Similarly, the cell below a marble (i+1,i) is adjacent only to (i,i). Therefore, these cells are adjacent to only one marble. Therefore, moving the marble (i,i) to (i,i+1) would place it adjacent to marble (i,i) which is the original marble. Wait, no, if you move (i,i) to (i,i+1), then the new marble at (i,i+1) is adjacent to (i,i) which is now empty, but (i,i+1) is adjacent to (i-1,i+1) if there&#39;s a marble there. But in the main diagonal arrangement, (i-1,i+1) is two cells away from (i-1,i-1), so no marble there. Wait, this is confusing. Let&#39;s take a concrete example.Consider the main diagonal arrangement in a 4x4 grid. Marbles at (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). Now, consider cell (1,2). This is adjacent to marble (1,1). If we move marble (1,1) to (1,2), then (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2) which is a marble. Therefore, moving (1,1) to (1,2) results in adjacency with (2,2). Similarly, cell (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1) and (2,2). If we move (2,2) to (2,1), it&#39;s adjacent to (1,1). So indeed, in the main diagonal arrangement, every empty cell adjacent to a marble is adjacent to another marble. Therefore, moving any marble to an adjacent cell would place it next to another marble. But how does this relate to the covering argument? In this case, each empty cell adjacent to a marble is adjacent to exactly one marble only if it&#39;s on the edge. Wait, no. For example, cell (2,3) in the 4x4 grid is adjacent to marble (2,2) and (3,3). So cell (2,3) is adjacent to two marbles. Similarly, cell (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2) and (3,3). So in the main diagonal arrangement, the cells between two diagonal marbles are adjacent to two marbles. However, edge cells like (1,2) are only adjacent to one marble. But in the example above, moving marble (1,1) to (1,2) would conflict with marble (2,2). Wait, how? (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1) and (2,2). If we move (1,1) to (1,2), the new marble at (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2), which is already a marble. Hence, the conflict. But in this case, cell (1,2) was originally adjacent to only one marble (1,1), but moving the marble there causes a conflict with another marble (2,2). Therefore, the original cell&#39;s adjacency to other marbles is not the only factor; the movement&#39;s new position&#39;s adjacency is what matters.This complicates the covering argument. Therefore, perhaps another approach is needed.Let&#39;s think about part b). We need the largest k such that every arrangement of k marbles allows moving one marble to a neighboring cell without conflict. So, equivalently, there is no arrangement of k marbles where every marble is &quot;blocked&quot; from moving. The value of k we&#39;re looking for is just one less than the minimal number where such a blocked arrangement exists. From part a), we know that k=2024 allows a blocked arrangement. Therefore, the answer to part b) is 2023? But that seems too straightforward, and likely incorrect, because the minimal k where a blocked arrangement exists might be much lower. For example, in smaller grids, like the 2x2 grid, the minimal k where a blocked arrangement exists is 2, so the answer for part b) would be 1. In the 3x3 grid, we saw that k=4 allows a blocked arrangement, so the answer would be 3. However, in the 1x1 grid, trivial case, k=0 or 1.But the question is about a 2024x2024 grid. If in part a), k=2024 allows a blocked arrangement, then the minimal such k is 2024, making the answer to part b) 2023. But I need to verify whether there are smaller k that also allow blocked arrangements. For example, maybe k=1012 allows a blocked arrangement, which would mean the answer is 1011. But how can we know?Wait, let&#39;s think of another arrangement. Suppose we divide the grid into 2x2 blocks. In each 2x2 block, place a marble in the top-left and bottom-right cells. This way, each marble is adjacent to another marble diagonally, but not orthogonally. Then, in such an arrangement, can we move any marble? If we try to move a marble from (i,j) to an adjacent cell, say (i+1,j), then (i+1,j) is in the next block. If that block also has a marble at (i+1,j+1), then moving the marble to (i+1,j) would be adjacent to (i+1,j+1). Therefore, this arrangement also blocks movement. The number of marbles in this case would be (2024/2)x(2024/2)x2 = (1012x1012)x2 = 2024x1012, which is much larger than 2024. So this is a different arrangement with higher k, but part a)&#39;s k=2024 is much smaller.Therefore, it&#39;s possible to have blocked arrangements with different k&#39;s. The problem is asking for the largest k such that EVERY arrangement of k marbles allows moving one. So if there exists even one arrangement at some k that blocks movement, then k cannot be the answer. Therefore, we need the maximal k where ALL arrangements of k marbles are movable. To find this, we need to ensure that no matter how you place k marbles, there&#39;s always at least one marble that can be moved. Therefore, the question is equivalent to finding the maximum k such that the graph&#39;s independence number minus something, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, consider that in any independent set S of size k, there must be at least one vertex in S with a neighbor not in S and not adjacent to any other vertex in S. To guarantee this, k must be less than the minimal size of a maximal independent set. A maximal independent set is one where you cannot add any more vertices without violating independence. In our case, a maximal independent set would be an arrangement where every empty cell is adjacent to at least one marble, so you can&#39;t add another marble. However, our problem is about moving marbles, not adding. But there&#39;s a relationship. If an independent set S is not maximal, then there exists an empty cell that is not adjacent to any marbles, so you can add a marble there. But we need to move a marble, not add. However, if there&#39;s an empty cell adjacent to a marble and not adjacent to any other marbles, then you can move the marble there. The size of the largest non-maximal independent set would be relevant here. The maximum k such that every independent set of size k is not maximal. But again, not directly applicable.Wait, but in our problem, moving a marble is equivalent to removing it from its current position and placing it in a neighboring cell. So it&#39;s like a combination of removal and addition. So even if the independent set is maximal, you might still be able to move a marble. For example, in the checkerboard pattern (maximal independent set), you can&#39;t add any more marbles, but can you move any? If you have a marble at (i,j), can you move it to a neighboring cell? The neighboring cells are all in the opposite color, which are already adjacent to other marbles. So moving a marble from (i,j) to a neighboring cell would place it in a cell adjacent to other marbles. Therefore, in the maximal independent set (checkerboard), you cannot move any marbles. Therefore, the maximal independent set is also a blocked arrangement.The size of the maximal independent set is (2024^2)/2 = 2024*1012. Therefore, if k=2024*1012, then there&#39;s an arrangement (the checkerboard) where you can&#39;t move any marbles. Therefore, the answer to part b) must be less than 2024*1012. But that&#39;s a huge number, and part a)&#39;s k=2024 is much smaller. But the problem is asking for the largest k such that FOR ALL arrangements of k marbles, you can move one. So even if there exists one arrangement at that k which is movable, but others are not, then k is invalid. We need that ALL arrangements at k are movable. Therefore, the answer is the maximal k such that there does NOT exist any arrangement of k marbles that is blocked. Therefore, it&#39;s one less than the minimal k where a blocked arrangement exists. From part a), we know that k=2024 allows a blocked arrangement, so the minimal such k is 2024, making the answer to part b) k=2023. But we need to check if there exists a blocked arrangement with k=2023. If yes, then the answer would be 2022, and so on. But how do we know that k=2024 is the minimal k with a blocked arrangement? Maybe there are smaller k. For example, in a 2024x2024 grid, maybe you can create a blocked arrangement with k=1012 by placing marbles in a checkerboard pattern on a subgrid. But if you place marbles spaced out such that each is isolated, but that&#39;s not possible. Wait, no. If you place marbles such that each marble is surrounded by other marbles in such a way that they block movement. Wait, but marbles can&#39;t be adjacent. So to block a marble&#39;s movement, its neighboring cells must be either occupied or adjacent to other marbles. Wait, in part a), the example with marbles along the main diagonal uses k=2024. Each marble blocks the others by being diagonally adjacent. But can we create a smaller blocked arrangement? For example, place marbles in a pattern where each marble is &quot;covered&quot; by another marble&#39;s adjacency. Consider placing marbles in a horizontal line, each separated by one cell. For example, in row 1, place marbles at columns 1,3,5,...,2023. Then, in row 2, don&#39;t place any marbles. In row 3, place marbles at columns 2,4,6,...,2024. This creates a pattern where each marble in row 1 has a marble diagonally below and to the right in row 3. Similarly, marbles in row 3 have marbles diagonally above and to the left. In this case, moving a marble from row 1, column 1 to row 1, column 2 would be adjacent to the marble at row 3, column 2. Similarly, moving any marble would result in adjacency. However, this arrangement has k=1012*2=2024 marbles. So it&#39;s the same as part a)&#39;s example.Alternatively, maybe a spiral pattern or some other configuration, but it&#39;s unclear. It seems that the minimal k where a blocked arrangement exists is 2024, as per part a). Therefore, the answer to part b) would be 2023. But I need to confirm.Suppose k=2023. Can there exist a blocked arrangement with k=2023 marbles? If yes, then the answer would be 2022. But if every arrangement of 2023 marbles allows moving a marble, then the answer is 2023.To check this, consider that in part a), we have an arrangement with 2024 marbles where no marble can be moved. If we remove one marble from that arrangement, we get k=2023. Now, in the resulting arrangement, there&#39;s an empty cell where the marble was removed. The original marble was at (i,i). Its neighbors were (i±1,i) and (i,i±1). After removal, the cell (i,i) is empty. The neighboring cells of (i,i) are adjacent to other marbles. For example, (i+1,i) is adjacent to (i+1,i+1). Therefore, if we try to move a marble from (i+1,i+1) to (i,i), would that be possible? The cell (i,i) is adjacent to (i-1,i) which might have a marble if i &gt; 1. Similarly, (i,i) is adjacent to (i,i-1) which might have a marble if j &gt; 1. Wait, no. In the main diagonal arrangement, the only marbles are on (j,j). So the neighbors of (i,i) are (i±1,i) and (i,i±1). In the original arrangement, these cells are empty, but adjacent to other marbles. For example, (i+1,i) is adjacent to (i+1,i+1). If we remove (i,i), then the cell (i,i) is empty, and its neighbors are still adjacent to other marbles. So can we move a marble to (i,i)? The marbles adjacent to (i,i) are at (i+1,i+1), (i-1,i-1), but those are not adjacent to (i,i). Wait, no. (i+1,i) is adjacent to (i+1,i+1), which is a marble. Similarly, (i,i+1) is adjacent to (i+1,i+1). So if we want to move a marble to (i,i), we can take any marble adjacent to (i,i)&#39;s neighbors. For example, the marble at (i+1,i+1) can be moved to (i+1,i) or (i,i+1), but those cells are adjacent to other marbles. However, if we remove (i,i), creating an empty cell, can we move another marble into (i,i)? For example, the marble at (i-1,i-1) could be moved to (i-1,i), but that cell is adjacent to (i-1,i+1), which in the original arrangement has a marble at (i-1,i-1) and (i-1,i+1) is empty. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, in the main diagonal arrangement with one marble missing, there&#39;s an empty cell at (i,i). To move a marble into (i,i), we need a marble adjacent to (i,i). But in the main diagonal arrangement, the neighbors of (i,i) are not marbles. However, their neighbors are marbles. For example, (i+1,i) is adjacent to (i+1,i+1), which is a marble. So if we want to move (i+1,i+1) to (i+1,i), we can&#39;t because (i+1,i) is adjacent to (i+1,i+1), which would conflict. Therefore, even with one marble missing, moving any marble would still result in a conflict. Therefore, this arrangement with k=2023 is also blocked. Hence, k=2023 also allows a blocked arrangement. Therefore, the minimal k is lower.This suggests that even k=1 allows a blocked arrangement, which is not possible. If you have one marble, you can always move it to any neighboring cell, as long as it&#39;s not on the edge. Wait, if the marble is placed in the center, you can move it in any direction. If it&#39;s placed at the corner, you can move it to an adjacent edge cell. So no, k=1 cannot be blocked. Similarly, k=2 can be blocked if placed in opposite corners, but moving either marble would still be possible. Wait, in a 2024x2024 grid, if you place two marbles at (1,1) and (2024,2024), can you move either? Yes, moving (1,1) to (1,2) is allowed since it&#39;s not adjacent to (2024,2024). Similarly, moving (2024,2024) to (2024,2023) is allowed. Therefore, k=2 cannot be blocked. Similarly, k=3 might be possible to block, but not sure.This implies that the minimal k where a blocked arrangement exists is higher. Maybe the example from part a) is the minimal such k=2024. Therefore, if we can show that for k=2023, any arrangement allows moving a marble, then the answer is 2023.But how to prove that for k=2023, every arrangement has at least one movable marble? Consider the grid graph. If we have an independent set S of size 2023, we need to show that there exists at least one marble in S that can be moved to an adjacent cell without conflicting. Assume for contradiction that there exists an independent set S of size 2023 where every marble cannot be moved. That means, for every marble in S, all four neighboring cells are either occupied or adjacent to another marble. But since S is an independent set, no two marbles are adjacent. Therefore, for each marble, its four neighboring cells are either occupied (which they can&#39;t be, since S is independent) or adjacent to another marble. Wait, no. The marbles are in S, and the neighboring cells are either in S or not. If a neighboring cell is in S, then the original marble is adjacent to another marble, which contradicts S being independent. Therefore, all neighboring cells of each marble must be adjacent to another marble. But since S is independent, the neighboring cells are not in S, so they must be adjacent to another marble in S.Therefore, for each marble s in S, each of its four neighbors must be adjacent to at least one other marble in S. This forms a structure where every empty cell adjacent to a marble is adjacent to at least two marbles. Because each neighbor of s is adjacent to s and at least one other marble. Therefore, each neighbor of s is adjacent to at least two marbles: s and another. Now, consider the entire grid. The number of marbles is k=2023. Each marble has four neighbors, and each neighbor is adjacent to at least two marbles. Let’s compute the total number of adjacencies. Each empty cell adjacent to marbles is counted by the number of marbles it is adjacent to. Let E be the number of empty cells adjacent to marbles. Each such empty cell is adjacent to at least two marbles. The total number of adjacency pairs (marble, empty cell) is at least 2E. On the other hand, each marble has four neighbors, some of which may be empty or occupied. Since S is independent, occupied neighbors are impossible. Therefore, each marble has four neighbors, all empty, and each of these empty neighbors is adjacent to at least two marbles. Therefore, the total number of adjacency pairs is 4k = 4*2023. But since each empty cell is counted as many times as the number of marbles adjacent to it, which is at least two, we have 4k ≥ 2E ⇒ E ≤ 2k = 4046.But the number of empty cells adjacent to marbles is E. The total number of empty cells is 2024² - k = 2024² - 2023 = 2024² - 2024 + 1 = 2024(2024 - 1) +1. But this is a huge number, much larger than 4046. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction, implying that our assumption is wrong. Hence, there cannot exist such an independent set S of size k=2023 where every marble cannot be moved. Therefore, for k=2023, every arrangement must have at least one marble that can be moved. Therefore, the answer to part b) is 2023.But wait, let&#39;s double-check the math. The total number of adjacency pairs (marble, empty cell) is 4k, since each marble has four neighbors, and none of them are occupied (since S is independent). Each empty cell adjacent to marbles is adjacent to at least two marbles, so E ≤ 4k / 2 = 2k. Therefore, E ≤ 2*2023 = 4046. However, the actual number of empty cells adjacent to marbles is much larger. For example, in a grid of size 2024x2024, the number of edge cells (cells on the border) is 4*2024 -4. Each such cell has three neighbors. The total number of empty cells adjacent to marbles would depend on the arrangement, but even a single marble in the center would have four empty adjacent cells. If marbles are spread out, the number of empty cells adjacent to marbles would be approximately 4k. But since k=2023, 4k≈8092. However, we derived that E ≤ 4046, which is half of that. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption that every empty cell adjacent to a marble is adjacent to at least two marbles is false. Therefore, there must exist at least one empty cell adjacent to only one marble, allowing us to move that marble there. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.Hence, the largest k is 2023.</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>✅:</span>a) Place each marble along the main diagonal of the grid, i.e., in cells ((i, i)) for (1 leq i leq 2024).

Arrange Marbles on the Diagonal:   - Place each of the 2024 marbles on one of the two main diagonals of the (2024 times 2024) grid. For example, place a marble at each cell ((i, i)) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 2024).2. Verify the Condition:   - Each marble is placed such that no two marbles are in neighboring cells. Neighboring cells share an edge, but in this arrangement, each marble is only diagonally adjacent to another marble, not sharing an edge.3. Check the Movement Condition:   - Moving any marble to a neighboring cell (either up, down, left, or right) will place it in a cell that is already occupied by another marble, violating the condition that no two marbles are in neighboring cells.Thus, the arrangement satisfies the conditions, and moving any marble will violate the conditions. Part (b)1. Claim: (k = 2023) is the Largest Value:   - We need to show that for (k = 2023), there exists an arrangement where moving any marble to a neighboring cell will still satisfy the conditions.2. Assume (k = 2024 - n) Marbles:   - Let (n geq 1). We need to show that there is always a way to move a marble if (k &lt; 2024).3. Free Rows and Columns:   - Since there are fewer than 2024 marbles, there will be rows and columns without any marbles, called free rows and columns.   - Let (p) be the number of free columns and (q) be the number of free rows. Without loss of generality, assume (p geq q).4. Claim 1: No Two Free Rows are Adjacent:   - If there were two adjacent free rows, there must be a marble adjacent to this block. Moving this marble into the block would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption.5. Claim 2: The Leftmost Column is Not Free:   - If the leftmost column were free, moving a marble from the next column to the leftmost column would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption.6. Marbles in Non-Free Columns:   - For each free column, the column immediately to the left contains a marble. If a marble is at ((x, y)), there must be another marble at ((x+2, y)) to prevent moving the marble to ((x+1, y)).7. Counting Marbles and Rows:   - There are (p) free columns, so there are at least (p) pairs of marbles with a distance vector ((2, 0)). These pairs use up (p) rows.   - The remaining (2024 - n - 2p) marbles can use at most (2024 - n - 2p) rows.   - Therefore, at most (p + (2024 - n - 2p) = 2024 - n - p) rows have marbles, implying at least (p + n) rows are free.8. Contradiction:   - Since (p geq q), the number of free rows (q) must be at least (p + n), which is a contradiction.Thus, the largest value of (k) such that for all arrangements of (k) marbles, we can move one marble to a neighboring cell and still satisfy the conditions is (k = 2023).The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2023 } )</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-d9c3ddfb data-v-6400c8a0><div class="review" data-v-6400c8a0><div class="review-title" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>❓:</span> p  is a prime number that is greater than  2 .

Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, the sequence is defined by this linear recurrence relation. Since p is a prime greater than 2, p is odd, so p/2 might not be an integer, but (p/2)^4 is (p^4)/16. Wait, but the problem statement mentions that 16 divides a_{81}, so maybe (p/2)^4 is actually an integer? But p is a prime greater than 2, so p is odd, so p/2 is not an integer. Therefore, (p/2)^4 would be p^4 divided by 16. But the right-hand side of the equation is (n+1)a_n - (p/2)^4. However, the left-hand side is n times a_{n+1}. So unless (p/2)^4 is an integer, the entire equation might involve fractions. But since a_1 is 5, which is an integer, maybe all a_n are integers? Let me check that.Starting with a_1 = 5, which is an integer. Then for n=1, the recurrence is 1*a_2 = 2*a_1 - (p/2)^4. So a_2 = (2*5 - (p^4)/16)/1 = 10 - (p^4)/16. Wait, but p is a prime greater than 2, so p is at least 3. Then p^4 is 81, 256, etc. So (p^4)/16 would be 81/16, which is 5.0625. So a_2 would be 10 - 5.0625 = 4.9375. That&#39;s not an integer. But the problem statement says &quot;the sequence {a_n}&quot; without specifying if it&#39;s integer or not. However, the conclusion is that 16 divides a_{81}, which implies that a_{81} is an integer multiple of 16. So maybe even though the terms might not be integers, a_{81} ends up being an integer divisible by 16. But how?Wait, perhaps (p/2)^4 is actually (p^4)/16, but since the problem is about divisibility by 16, maybe when we subtract (p^4)/16 from (n+1)a_n, the result is divisible by n, making a_{n+1} an integer. Let&#39;s check for n=1:a_2 = [2*5 - (p^4)/16]/1 = 10 - (p^4)/16. For this to be an integer, (p^4)/16 must be an integer. But p is a prime greater than 2, so p is odd. Therefore, p^4 is congruent to 1 mod 16, since any odd number squared is 1 mod 8, and to the fourth power is 1 mod 16. So p^4 ≡ 1 mod 16, so (p^4)/16 is (16k + 1)/16 = k + 1/16, which is not an integer. Wait, this seems problematic. How can a_2 be an integer if (p^4)/16 is not an integer?Is there a misinterpretation here? Let me check the original problem again. It says: &quot;na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n - (p/2)^4&quot;. So the equation is n times a_{n+1} equals (n+1)a_n minus (p/2)^4. So solving for a_{n+1} gives a_{n+1} = [(n+1)a_n - (p/2)^4]/n. Therefore, unless [(n+1)a_n - (p/2)^4] is divisible by n, a_{n+1} would not be an integer. But the problem states that a_1 = 5, and p is a prime greater than 2. So perhaps there is a specific p here? Wait, no, the problem says &quot;the 16 | a_{81}&quot;, which is to say that regardless of the prime p &gt;2, as long as the sequence is defined with a_1=5, then 16 divides a_{81}. Wait, that seems odd. Because if p is a variable, then (p/2)^4 is different for different p. Therefore, maybe the problem is missing some constraints? Or perhaps the problem is not dependent on p? Wait, the problem states &quot;Let {a_n} be a sequence such that na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n - (p/2)^4. Show that if a_1=5, the 16 | a_{81}.&quot; So maybe the p is fixed here? Wait, no, p is given as a prime greater than 2, but it&#39;s not specified which prime. So the conclusion must hold for any prime p &gt;2. Therefore, regardless of which prime p we choose, as long as we define the sequence with that p and starting at a_1=5, then a_{81} is divisible by 16. That&#39;s the statement to prove.But then how does the term (p/2)^4 affect the sequence? If p is variable, then (p/2)^4 is variable. So the sequence {a_n} depends on p. However, the conclusion that 16 divides a_{81} must hold for any prime p&gt;2. So even though (p/2)^4 is different for different p, the a_{81} ends up being divisible by 16 regardless of the choice of p. That&#39;s interesting.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a typo in the problem statement? Perhaps instead of (p/2)^4, it&#39;s supposed to be (p^4)/16? But that&#39;s the same as (p/2)^4. So the term is (p^4)/16, which is (p/2)^4. So the problem is correct as stated.But then how do we handle this? Let&#39;s think recursively. The recurrence is linear, so perhaps we can solve the recurrence relation explicitly. Let&#39;s try to find a general formula for a_n.The recurrence is:n a_{n+1} = (n + 1) a_n - (p^4)/16We can rewrite this as:a_{n+1} = [(n + 1)/n] a_n - (p^4)/(16n)This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard method to solve such equations is to find an integrating factor or use the method of solving linear recurrences.First, let&#39;s write the recurrence in the standard form:a_{n+1} - [(n + 1)/n] a_n = - (p^4)/(16n)But linear recurrence equations usually have the form a_{n+1} + P(n) a_n = Q(n). Here, the coefficient of a_n is - (n + 1)/n. Wait, actually, maybe it&#39;s better to consider the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.The homogeneous equation is:a_{n+1} = [(n + 1)/n] a_nWhich can be rewritten as:a_{n+1}/ (n + 1) = a_n / nSo this suggests that the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C * n, where C is a constant.Then, to find a particular solution, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters. Let&#39;s use variation of parameters. Assume the particular solution is of the form a_n^p = C(n) * n.Substitute into the nonhomogeneous equation:a_{n+1}^p = [(n + 1)/n] a_n^p - (p^4)/(16n)But a_{n+1}^p = C(n+1)*(n+1)And [(n + 1)/n] a_n^p = [(n + 1)/n] * C(n)*n = (n + 1) C(n)Therefore:C(n+1)*(n+1) = (n + 1) C(n) - (p^4)/(16n)Divide both sides by (n + 1):C(n+1) = C(n) - (p^4)/(16n(n + 1))So we have a recurrence for C(n):C(n+1) - C(n) = - (p^4)/(16n(n + 1))This is a telescoping series. Summing from n = 1 to n = k-1:C(k) - C(1) = - (p^4)/16 * Σ_{n=1}^{k-1} [1/(n(n + 1))]The sum Σ_{n=1}^{k-1} 1/(n(n + 1)) is a telescoping series:Σ_{n=1}^{k-1} [1/n - 1/(n + 1)] = 1 - 1/kTherefore,C(k) = C(1) - (p^4)/16 * (1 - 1/k)Therefore, the particular solution is:a_k^p = C(k) * k = [C(1) - (p^4)/16 * (1 - 1/k)] * k = C(1)*k - (p^4)/16 * (k - 1)Therefore, the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution:a_k = a_k^h + a_k^p = C * k + C(1)*k - (p^4)/16 * (k - 1)Wait, but the homogeneous solution is C * k, and the particular solution is also involving C(1)*k. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again.Wait, when we assumed the particular solution is a_n^p = C(n) * n, then substituting into the equation gave us the recurrence for C(n). Then, solving for C(n) gives C(k) = C(1) - (p^4)/16*(1 - 1/k). Therefore, the particular solution is a_k^p = C(k)*k = [C(1) - (p^4)/16*(1 - 1/k)]*k = C(1)*k - (p^4)/16*(k - 1). But since the homogeneous solution is a_k^h = D * k, where D is a constant, the general solution would be a_k = D * k + C(1)*k - (p^4)/16*(k - 1). Wait, but this seems to merge the constants. Let me re-examine the process.Actually, in variation of parameters, the homogeneous solution is a_k^h = D * k, and the particular solution is a_k^p = C(k) * k, where C(k) is determined by the equation. So the general solution is a_k = D * k + a_k^p. However, in the process above, we found that C(k) = C(1) - (p^4)/16*(1 - 1/k), so a_k^p = [C(1) - (p^4)/16*(1 - 1/k)] * k = C(1)*k - (p^4)/16*(k - 1). Therefore, the general solution is a_k = D * k + C(1)*k - (p^4)/16*(k - 1). But this combines the constants D and C(1). Let&#39;s just combine them into a single constant: a_k = E * k - (p^4)/16*(k - 1), where E is a constant determined by initial conditions.So applying the initial condition a_1 = 5:For k=1, a_1 = E *1 - (p^4)/16*(1 -1) = E. Therefore, E = 5. Thus, the general solution is:a_k = 5k - (p^4)/16*(k -1)Therefore, a_k = 5k - (p^4)(k -1)/16So that&#39;s the explicit formula for a_n. Now, we need to compute a_{81} and show that 16 divides it.Compute a_{81}:a_{81} = 5*81 - (p^4)(81 -1)/16 = 405 - (p^4)(80)/16 = 405 - 5 p^4Therefore, a_{81} = 405 - 5 p^4Now, we need to show that 16 divides 405 -5 p^4. So 16 | (405 -5 p^4). Which is equivalent to 405 -5 p^4 ≡ 0 mod 16. Let&#39;s compute each term modulo 16.First, compute 405 mod 16:16*25 = 400, so 405 -400=5, so 405 ≡ 5 mod 16.Then, compute 5 p^4 mod 16. Since p is a prime greater than 2, p is odd. Any odd integer can be written as 2k +1. Let&#39;s compute p^4 mod 16 for odd p.Note that for any odd integer p, p ≡ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, or 15 mod 16. However, since p is a prime greater than 2, p can be 3,5,7,11,13, etc. But primes greater than 2 are all odd, so p is odd.Now, compute p^4 mod 16 for odd p. Let&#39;s note that:(1)^4 =1 mod16(3)^4=81 mod16=1(5)^4=625 mod16=1 (since 625=16*39 +1)Similarly, 7^4=2401=16*150 +1, so 1 mod16Similarly, 9^4=(9^2)^2=81^2≡1^2=1 mod16Similarly, any odd number to the fourth power is congruent to 1 mod16. Because:Let p be odd, so p ≡ 1,3,5,7 mod8, but actually mod16. Wait, more precisely, Euler&#39;s theorem tells us that since φ(16)=8, and p is coprime to 16, p^8 ≡1 mod16. But for fourth powers:Check (2k+1)^4. Expand it:(2k+1)^4 =16k^4 +32k^3 +24k^2 +8k +1. Modulo16, this is 0 +0 + (24k^2 mod16) + (8k mod16) +1. 24k^2 ≡ 8k^2 mod16, and 8k mod16. So overall, it&#39;s 8k^2 +8k +1. But depending on k, this can vary. Wait, maybe my previous assertion is incorrect. Wait, but when I tried specific numbers, like 3,5,7,9, their fourth powers were all 1 mod16. Let&#39;s verify:Take p=3: 3^4=81=5*16 +1, so 81≡1 mod16.p=5: 5^4=625=39*16 +1 ⇒ 625≡1 mod16.p=7:7^4=2401=150*16 +1 ⇒ 2401≡1 mod16.p=9:9 is 9 mod16, 9^4=(9^2)^2=81^2≡1^2=1 mod16.Similarly, p=11:11 mod16, 11^4=(11^2)^2=121^2≡9^2=81≡1 mod16.Similarly, p=13:13^4=(13^2)^2=169^2≡9^2=81≡1 mod16.p=15:15^4=(15^2)^2=225^2≡1^2=1 mod16.Therefore, indeed, for any odd integer p, p^4 ≡1 mod16.Therefore, p^4 ≡1 mod16, so 5 p^4 ≡5*1=5 mod16.Therefore, 405 -5 p^4 ≡5 -5=0 mod16. Therefore, 16 divides (405 -5 p^4), which is a_{81}. Hence, 16 | a_{81}.Wait, that&#39;s the conclusion. So the key steps were:1. Solve the recurrence relation to find an explicit formula for a_n.2. Substitute n=81 into the formula to get a_{81}=405 -5p^4.3. Compute each term modulo16: 405 ≡5 mod16 and 5p^4≡5 mod16 (since p is odd, p^4≡1 mod16).4. Therefore, 405 -5p^4 ≡5 -5≡0 mod16, so 16 divides a_{81}.Therefore, the conclusion holds.But let me verify the recurrence solution again to ensure there was no mistake. The recurrence was:n a_{n+1} = (n +1)a_n - (p/2)^4Which was rewritten as:a_{n+1} = [(n +1)/n] a_n - (p^4)/(16n)Then, solving the linear recurrence, we found the homogeneous solution a_n^h = C n, and then found a particular solution leading to a_k =5k - (p^4)(k -1)/16.Testing this formula with n=1: a_1=5*1 - (p^4)(0)/16=5, which matches. For n=2: a_2=5*2 - (p^4)(1)/16=10 - p^4/16. Then, using the original recurrence:1*a_2=2*5 - (p/2)^4 ⇒ a_2=10 - (p^4)/16, which matches. Similarly, n=2: a_3 = [(3)/2]a_2 - (p^4)/(16*2) = (3/2)(10 - p^4/16) - p^4/(32). Let&#39;s compute this:(3/2)*10 =15, (3/2)*(-p^4/16)= -3 p^4 /32, and then -p^4/32. So total a_3=15 -3p^4/32 -p^4/32=15 -4p^4/32=15 -p^4/8. Using the formula: a_3=5*3 - (p^4)(3 -1)/16=15 -2p^4/16=15 -p^4/8, which matches. So the formula seems correct.Therefore, the explicit solution is valid, and the conclusion follows. Hence, 16 divides a_{81}.Final Answerboxed{16 mid a_{81}}</p><div class="divider" data-v-6400c8a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-6400c8a0><span class="icon" data-v-6400c8a0>✅:</span>To show that (16 mid a_{81}) given the recurrence relation (na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n - left(frac{p}{2}right)^4) with (a_1 = 5) and (p) being a prime number greater than 2, we proceed as follows:1. Recurrence Relation Analysis:   The given recurrence relation is linear. Rewriting it, we have:   [   a_{n+1} = frac{(n+1)}{n}a_n - frac{p^4}{16n}   ]   This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.2. Solving the Recurrence:   - Homogeneous Solution: The homogeneous part is (a_{n+1} = frac{(n+1)}{n}a_n), leading to (a_n^h = C cdot n).   - Particular Solution: Using variation of parameters, we find the particular solution. Assuming (a_n^p = C(n) cdot n), we derive:     [     C(n+1) = C(n) - frac{p^4}{16} cdot frac{1}{n(n+1)}     ]     Summing the telescoping series, we get:     [     C(k) = C(1) - frac{p^4}{16} left(1 - frac{1}{k}right)     ]     Thus, the particular solution is:     [     a_k^p = 5k - frac{p^4}{16}(k - 1)     ]3. General Solution:   Combining homogeneous and particular solutions, and applying the initial condition (a_1 = 5), we get:   [   a_k = 5k - frac{p^4}{16}(k - 1)   ]4. Evaluating (a_{81}):   Substituting (k = 81) into the formula:   [   a_{81} = 5 cdot 81 - frac{p^4}{16} cdot 80 = 405 - 5p^4   ]5. Modulo Analysis:   - (405 mod 16 = 5)   - For any odd prime (p), (p^4 equiv 1 mod 16). Thus, (5p^4 equiv 5 mod 16).

Given Recurrence Relation:   [   na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_{n} - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4   ]   We need to find a general form for (a_n).2. Base Case:   Given (a_1 = 5).3. Inductive Hypothesis:   Assume (a_n = n a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (n-1)) holds for some (n).4. Inductive Step:   We need to show that (a_{n+1} = (n+1) a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 n).   Start with the given recurrence relation:   [   na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_{n} - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4   ]   Substitute the inductive hypothesis (a_n = n a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (n-1)):   [   na_{n+1} = (n+1) left( n a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (n-1) right) - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4   ]   Simplify the right-hand side:   [   na_{n+1} = (n+1) n a_1 - (n+1) left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (n-1) - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4   ]   [   na_{n+1} = n(n+1) a_1 - (n+1) left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (n-1) - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4   ]   [   na_{n+1} = n(n+1) a_1 - (n^2 - 1) left( frac{p}{2} right)^4   ]   Divide both sides by (n):   [   a_{n+1} = (n+1) a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 frac{n^2 - 1}{n}   ]   Simplify the fraction:   [   a_{n+1} = (n+1) a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (n - frac{1}{n})   ]   Since (n) is an integer, the term (frac{1}{n}) becomes negligible for large (n), and we can approximate:   [   a_{n+1} = (n+1) a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 n   ]   This completes the inductive step, confirming the general form:   [   a_n = n a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (n-1)   ]5. Specific Case for (a_{81}):   [   a_{81} = 81 a_1 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 (81-1)   ]   Given (a_1 = 5):   [   a_{81} = 81 cdot 5 - left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 cdot 80   ]   Simplify:   [   a_{81} = 405 - 80 left( frac{p}{2} right)^4   ]6. Divisibility by 16:   Since (p) is an odd prime, (p) can be written as (2k+1) for some integer (k). Therefore, (p^4) is also odd, and we know that:   [   p^4 equiv 1 pmod{16}   ]   This implies:   [   p^4 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{16}   ]   Therefore:   [   80 left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 equiv 80 cdot 1 equiv 80 pmod{16}   ]   Since (80 equiv 0 pmod{16}), it follows that:   [   405 - 80 left( frac{p}{2} right)^4 equiv 405 pmod{16}   ]   Since (405 equiv 5 pmod{16}), we have:   [   a_{81} equiv 5 pmod{16}   ]   Therefore, (16 mid a_{81}).The final answer is ( boxed{ 16 mid a_{81} } ).</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-d9c3ddfb><span data-v-d9c3ddfb>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.543x.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 gpt</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
